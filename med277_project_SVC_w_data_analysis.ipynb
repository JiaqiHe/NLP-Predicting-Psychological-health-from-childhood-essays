When it was over and I came out of the stage door there was crowds of people newspaper reporters, just about everyone was waiting. My photograhs were being taken, questions asked and I was nearly squashed, but I really enjoyed there being so many people. When I was in my flat at the Royal Hotel we have to bolt the door because people were trying to get in especially the reporters. Soon they all went away and I flung myself to bed. My life as a dancer and singer had been a success but now I must think about my homelife. Soon I settled down and got married. After a while I had two children who were twins a boy and a girl. I had then to decide on what life to give them. I gave them a happy home and I loved them very much. I took good care of them aswell. They grew up to be dancers and singers like me.\"  Words: 451\\r\\n',\n",
