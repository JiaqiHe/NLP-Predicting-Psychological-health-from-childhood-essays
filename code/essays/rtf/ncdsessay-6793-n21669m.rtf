I have got a job as a school teacher. I take a second year class in a junior school, and I also take the school football team. We are the defending champions of the schools first division and we hope to repeat the feat this year. At the moment we have played two games winning one four goals to one and drawing the other three each. I hope to become a headmaster before I retire. At weekends I usually have a pile of papers to mark but I still find time to do things I like to do, such as paint pictures and play with my dog, a black ladrador called Sergent or Sarge for short. I like watching football matches and I play cricket for [cricket club] an ameteur club in [town]. Matches are mostly on Saturday afternoons with a few played on week day maches. Usually on Saturday mornings I have to take the football team or cricket team in the summer. In a five a side competition for schools staged recently we were the runners up being beaten in the final three goals to two. I am about to get married in four months time. Tomorrow i am going to Liverpool with nintey seven boys from the school on the annual school excursion. We go by train setting* of at twelve minutes past eight a.m. and arrive home at eleven fifteen p.m.  Words: 235
