----------------------
I have taken the full time of my school life into consideration and have made it worth while. For other things I have lacked I have tried to make amendation*.
I have tried to get my job with any connection to do with sport, and as I have succeeded I feel very pleased with myself.
I wanted to get even money for the interests I leed at home. One of them is to get my books (this is always a part of my everyday life) as I am keen on reading. The next* half of the money goes to things around the house. And I always like to get the newest things. The other money goes to insurance policies and the rest is put forthwith into the banks.
I also have a great liking for building airfix kits (models) ever since I was a boy and I do not spend to much money out on this as some take such a long time to build. 
I do not have many other hobbes and all of my other ambitions have passed* out of mind, except to be a children's book writer I have read so many childrens books since I was a boy at the age of eleven that this is the only ambition I have left in my future life,  Words: 217
