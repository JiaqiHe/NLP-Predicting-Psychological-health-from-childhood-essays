I am twenty five, I work on a pipe line. I have a car, and have to drive about five miles to were I work. The flat I live in is not very big, (and) but I like it. When I wake up in the morning I have egg and bacon and black coffie. I set of for at eight o' clock and get to work about ten past. I drive a lorry with sa pipes in a some times a crane. The pipes weigh about a hundred stone. It is a hard job when you are lifting the pipes because if one falls a few others do. Some times I help to Put the pipes in place in the ditch. About one I have my dinner, and go back to work at live o' clock. I drive from [town] to Newcaslter I stop work at seven o' clock. In my flat I read the newspaper or a book. and some times I draw a bird because I would keep a bird if it had a broken wing or leg like I did when I was a boy. When I have a day off I like to go swimming or a long walk* in the hills. I have a gun because when I see stoat attacking some thing. it is just like seeing a person killing some one. Northumberland is a nice place in the morning, because it just about all ways as a pink sky, and when it snows it is always deep, when I was born it was three inches deep in the morning and about four in the evening.
