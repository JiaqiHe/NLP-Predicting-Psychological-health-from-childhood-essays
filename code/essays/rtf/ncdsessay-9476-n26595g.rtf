My Dad is a fisherman who is skipper of a ship and I want to own a ship to show my dad I can beet him because he says I will never own a ship. 
My home life is to do odd jobs to get two cars and two moter bikes I will do odd jobs like chop wood, dig gardens put windows in houses, tidy gardens, and sweep snow out of peoples path ways, brush dirty paths and put doors on sheds to get money for petrol and two cars. Some times I might watch football matches and bet with my pals that the other team will win. I will get a mini car for races a a B.S.A. moterBike.
