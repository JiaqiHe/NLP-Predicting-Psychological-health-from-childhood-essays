----------------------
I am married and have one girl aged two. I do a part time job in the evenings at an office for which I have to get someone to baby sit. I still ride a little and my daughter is begining to take interest. We have two hampsters and a cat. We live in a very small terraced house. My husband works on all weekdays exept Sunday at a sweet shop. (to my daughters great delight). My daughters name is [female name] (I got the name from a book). I like caring for my husband and child. Making sure they are properly fed and dressed. I am trying to save so we can go on a holiday this year. When [female name] is a little older I am going to put money in the Post Office for her. A new interest I have taken up is growiung plants, The sort you grow inside, and the house is full of them. We have very friendly nieghbours on either side and [female name] gets on well with the little girl across the road. My husband enjoys his work and we lead a very pleasant happy life. I don't really want any more children but I would like a larger house with at least two bedrooms and a big garden.  Words: 217
