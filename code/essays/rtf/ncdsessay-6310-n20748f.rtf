I am leading a very nice life as a hairdresser. I do not own the whole ofthe hairdressers-but I own half of it. My friend and I go out together and sometimes our boyfriends come with us. I have Thursday afternoon off. and then if it is nice I do some shopping. My home life is alright. I have a flat about half way up the building. one of my friends lives with me and we have great times together. My friend who works at the hairdressers with me only lives about two flats away from me so I can call for her when I go to work. She is 2b one year older than I am. After work we go to the pictures. We sometimes go to the ice rinks and we sometimes just go round to her flat or mine to play records.  Words: 145
