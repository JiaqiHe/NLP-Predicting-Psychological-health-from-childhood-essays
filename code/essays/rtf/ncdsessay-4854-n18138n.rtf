When I am 25 I would like to be a swiming teacher and enter myself for swiming contests. For a job I would like to be a Interpreter so that I could learn forien languages and be able to write in forien languages too. In my home I would have at least two pets for I am an animal lover, I would probaly have a golden labrador and a persian cat. If I had enough money and I was married I would go abroad for a while and if I liked a certain forien contry I would save up money and emagrate to it. For my car I would probaly have a citron if my hus band and myself were wealthy enough. I would first go to university because if I couldent be an Interpreter or a swiming teacher I would try to be a teacher. If I were to have a child I would like to have one girl and one boy, I would dress in smart clothes and make them look clean and tidy.  Words: 176
