Mx It was 1979, I was doing my too year course at universety. I was Learning how to be a teacher. I enjoyed my work very much. I had big hopes in myself to become amaths teacher. I always wanted to travel and see all the sights and meet different people so I took great care to study all the diffrerent languges that I could. My main hope was to pass my exsams to become ateacher. On the day of my exsamanation I walked slowly up the corridor wondering and hoping that I would pass. Slowly and timidly I gave three* knocks on the door. And atall man came to anser he kindly asked me to take aseat. He then told me that I had passed. For aminute I said nothing because I was so flabagasted. I then asked how soon I could start work he said that he had heard that ateacher was needed at aschool not far away and that I could start work the following week. I thought that preasous day would never come. It all brought back memories for when I was at school every thing had changed some things where more modirena. I stayed on at the school for ayear enjoying every minute of it and then I started traveling, the place that interrested me most was Italy with its fantaslsedx * fasintaing buildings. And then I settled down to teaching. I thought of my too years in* universty and how I enjoyed my work there as a student. And here at this school I stayed teaching children about maths.
