My work in my life is a book writer I have done a lot of books which have been published and sold in shops. I have a family and I am married I do the house work and when I finish it I continue my book writing. I have quite a few intrests I go to see peoples books and work they have done. On Sunday mornings I go to a Sunday School where I am a teacher. I hope to carry on book writing and being a teacher. The life I am leading is to become a play writer as well as a book writer and to do them as well as I do my book writing. Another of my intrests of becoming a leader of Girl Guides which I might become soon.  Words: 134
