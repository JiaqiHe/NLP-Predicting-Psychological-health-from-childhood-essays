I am now twenty five years of age. I have got a job as a designer. I desiegn things to help the flying industry. I am intrested in how to invent an aeroplane without wings it will look a bit like a flying saucer which has a propellar in side when it is in motion it will suck up air and then blow it out underneath giving the craft a lift into the air. It is an intresting job. The life I lead is easy good and very honest. I get well paid for my work. My hobby is drawing and painting pictures. I have entered quite a few pictures into art shows. Each Saturday I go to the school of art to learn how to paint animals. Also I visit many painting galaries to look over other artists work and copare thiers with mine. My intrests are watching soldiers and drawging them. My home is a nice little cottage in the countrysurrounded by a wood were I often take my dog for a walk. Also I draw wild animals in the wood there are plenty there.  Words: 187
