I have been teaching for a few years and I an enjoying it very much. I give the children appuratus and let them find things out for them selves. They are friendly and obidient. My interests are saving stamps my collection is now worth quite alot of money. I like music also, and tomorrow I am taking another grade & my teachers certificate. I live with my mother and father in a bungalow at [town]. I have leart to cook a few things but fortunatly my mother cooks all my meals. I practise on the piano for half an hour each night and go to lessons on Friday. I have one boyfriend called [name] and he takes me out every night to a night club or cafe. [name] is also a teacher at the Junior School next door. He teaches in the second year As I said I am interested in my work and collect and make appuratus. Like a marble arch this is where you roll a marble down a board and you count the number of marbles which go through the hole. For ex 2 marbles throught and 3 marbles not equals 5 marbles.
