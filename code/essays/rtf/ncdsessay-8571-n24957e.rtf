I would like to be a show-jumper. I am always wanting to be with horses. Some-times I would go for a walk and every day if there is a horse I would stop and play with it. Sometimes if there is a apple on a bit of bread I would give it to them. I want to live in a farm . I would only raise horses. I would groom them enter them for a show jumping shows. I could go for a ride every day . I would have lots of fun . I could may be go to a picnic on the horse and things like that . I would have lot s and lots of fun. That why I want to be a show jumper.  Words: 128
