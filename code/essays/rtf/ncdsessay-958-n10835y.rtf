"My work is teaching and I enjoy this very much, I teach a second year junior class and I teach reading, writing, english, and maths. Since I was five-years old I have always wanted to teach. When I come home in the afternoon at half-past-four I sit down and relax. I am married to a head-master, and in the evenings he helps me with the marking I have to do. The school I teach at is called ""[school name]'; its in '[area].'
When I have finished marking, I get my husband some coffee. We have two children. Whilst having my coffee I usually switch on the television, and do some knitting. 
When I'm off on leave I normally go out to parks, museums and take the children with me. Its not far to these places as I live at 104 [street name]. Also off on leave is my husband and children, we normally go to Bournemouth or Cornwall for our holiday's. The rason* is beacuse when I was a girl I used to go to Cornwall or Bournemouth and I loved going so much I can't help going. now I'm older, and it brings back happy memories.
I often go and see my mother and father, and even my sister if I can. My mother lives in [town] my father in [town], my sister in [town], as I live in the Birmingham area it is a bit awkward to see them off, for it is al least one hundred miles or more.
I hope to carry on teaching until I retire."  Words: 258
