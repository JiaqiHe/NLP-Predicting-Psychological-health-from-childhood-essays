I work at a big store at the modle counter. I sell modles and give people advise. Sometimes I have to help at the toy counter. But the worst time is were the bell goes, and every body makes a dash to the thing they want to buy. Sometimes people leave things like the odd glove or scarf behined ans so we have a lost-property deapertment and we take turnes being at the counter were people aske if we have got the thing they have lost. At home I make modles and read war books or history books. Some nights I go down to the club and have a game of chess or draphts.  Words: 114
