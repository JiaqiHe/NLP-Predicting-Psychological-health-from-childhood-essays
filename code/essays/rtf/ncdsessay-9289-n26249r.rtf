I'm working in Africa as a Geologist digging up the remains of preho*storic monsters I'm also discovering more about certain animals that roam the dark continent a great hobby but my real work is designing bridges and things like that I get quite a lot of money and I am able to buy myself a Aston Martin DB6. I still live with my parents but I often stay at hotels and visit famous landmarks during my holidays.  Words: 77
