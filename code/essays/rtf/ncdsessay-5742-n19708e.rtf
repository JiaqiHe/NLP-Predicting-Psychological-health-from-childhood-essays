I am married and I have two children, a boy and a girl. We have our own house and go abroad for our holidays, sometimes camping. I play a lot of football and tennis. We get up at 7.30 a m we have breakfast, and I leave to go to work at about 8.40am I go home for a 1 1/2 hour dinner break and get back in the evenings at about 5.45 p m. I play football for our local ametuar team at inside-right. Men have landed on the moon and you can go on a weeks trip to see it.  Words: 102
