Stamp collecting, going to football matches. reading fictionus stories and studying fossils. My home is on the [TOWN] and it is very costly. It has a big front garden and the back garden is for the children. In my spare time I might work in the garden, or carry on with my stamp collecting. I am be looking forward to retiring a the age of sixty. I have a car and any Sunday off I take my wife and children out. I would have a large sellection of books, and my hobby of stamp collect ing would be handed down to my children. If I had not got a Job as a photographer I might have been a Geoligist. (A PERSON WHO STUDYS ROCKS). A lot of it would have been the study of fossils. Being a photographer I have a choice of sports or any other thing. I have chosen sports and I travel around with a reporter who shall put the story to the photograph. The paper I work for is the [newspaper]. For my holidays I pick Spain.  Words: 204
