At the moment I'm studying at collage and I have already passed three O levels.
A the end of the years I'm hoping to leave collage and take up a job to go with air craft graduating all the time until I've learnt to actually  fly one and from there on I want to train to be a Civilian pilot.
For the weekends and days off I have, I mainly paint. I go to London and sit on the bank of the Thames, and paint the London bridge, houses of parliment and the Thames it's self.
I think I will all ways be a part time artist painting scenes from london and other big citys byt my main job will be flying. 
The sort of planes I would like to fly are B.O.A.C. Jets, and if they have them I would like to fly the Concord jets.
I'm living in my own house and hate having to wash dishes. But never the less I'm going to remain a bachelor another year, (that is until I leave collage).
My main Interests/hobbies are still bird watching and model collecting from which I had as a boy, other Interests I have are swiming and maths.  Words: 197
