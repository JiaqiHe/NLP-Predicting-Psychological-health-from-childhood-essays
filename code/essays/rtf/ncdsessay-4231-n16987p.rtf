I had left school at 18 years of age and started work as a vetenry surgen when I was 20. I caught the bus into [town] where I lived and went home to help my mother with the houswork. I then got out my stamp collection which had been my best hobby since I was a small girl and still was. I had been very fond of animals all my life and it had always been my ambition to to be a vet. It had been a very tiresome day and I was ready to go to bed."  Words: 133
