Frist I would like my dad to learn how to drive a car. Then I would get a job at a garage and learn about cars. I would like to have a pet dog. and become a raceing car driver. I would like to have a sports car to drive in on the roads and I would like to have a mini sportscar or a ery type jagaur to race in and I would still save stamps and cions. Up in our loft is a train set and I would keep ading things to it.  Words: 95
