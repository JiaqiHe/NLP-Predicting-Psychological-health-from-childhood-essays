"My name is [name]. And I am twenty five years old. And my Job is a hair dresser. I have a little saloon of my own. A lot of people come to my saloon. And some people are fussy With there hair. I cut little childrens hair. I work from Eight o"" clock in the morning to half past Eight at night. I have half day on Thursday. When I go home at night I go swimming. for half an hour. And when some people come to my saloon they are all dressed up in posh clothes. When I go there in the morning I tidy every Where up. for the customers to come, when they come there are a lot of people out by my saloon door. and when I run out of shampoo. and other things. I have to order the things. In the holidays I go to Australia, Spain, and America, And I buy new things for my Saloon, And When I come home I am Terrible brown, And no one hardly knows me. And it is awful hot in other countries, And when I come back it is cold, And most of the little children are growing there hair. So I have to trim there hair instead, And most children like their hair curled under When it is long. And sometimes I go round peoples houses to do there hair. I am very happy with My work and my hobbies. and I would never change With any body Else."  Words: 253
