I want to join the army at eighteen years old. I have sent off for the leaflets. It tells you what you do and shows you pictures of the jobs. (First) First I would go to an imformation army office. I would ask for more details. You get different amounts of money for each job you do. I want to be an infantry man or I want to drive a tank. You have to be able to swim or else you could fall into a river when you were (swang)* swinging across and drown. By the age twenty five I would have been in the army for seven years and I hope to be a fully trained soldier. I will have to be very tough. I would be shown how to use a machine gun how to throw a grenade it was an infantry soldier. I'd learn all the parts on different kinds of guns. I would be shown how to fight a persen if he had a knife. There is sport in your spare time. There is football rugby cricket fencing and other things. You learn how to do judo.  Words: 191
