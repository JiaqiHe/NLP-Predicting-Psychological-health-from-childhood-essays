I am living with a friend in a flat. I go home to see my Mother, Sister, Nephew. I am earning a good wage and I am quiet happy with what I'm doing I go out a lot at night with my boyfriend my girlfriend and her boyfriend. I go home to live when I get my holidays because my mum has such a lot to do that I cannot always get to see her. When I go home I go to see my friends I left behind maybe take a pack of food and go for a bike ride with them. When I go home one of my friends sees me with nearly always a nice suit or dress on and is jealous. I come home and let the flat go when its christmas and live with my family for about six months until I've got some where else to go. I am quite happy and have no intention of getting married until I have found the wright man. I go for a long visit sometimes to London or Australia. I like traveling My brother he's 31 takes me out when I'm at home we don't see a lot of him as it is. I sometimes go and help at a Hairdresser's. She has always been a friend of mine and nearly always needs help. My sister is 34 and has one child she is very pleased to see me and so is my nephew he is fifteen and is seems funny to see hum as a baby and as a teenager as well.  Words: 265
