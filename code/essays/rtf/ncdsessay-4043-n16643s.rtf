I have a full time job as a geoligist calculating where and how to mine a cetain mineral or rock eg. Coal or Limstone. Somtimes I go abroad in search of Marble or diomonds. I live in a large cottage just outside Manchester (a few miles away) in it I have a room for making my own furnitur ect. Also I have an organ (Medium sized) and a 120 base accordion. As pets I have four peacocks and one mina bird. I am single and I will stay that way. I have a traction engine and I enter races whith it. for getting about I have a home made car. Along whith the cottage I have six acres of land in which I keep wild animals (not cages or fences) and I do my best to keep the place looking pleasent for the animals and myself.  Words: 146
