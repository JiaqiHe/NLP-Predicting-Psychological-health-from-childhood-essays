I am an Air Hostess. I travel all over the world. On the aeroplanes I serve people their food and make sure that they are comfortable and that they have a pleasant journey. 
When I am at home on holiday, I go out with my friends, to the cinema or to dances. 
I live in a flat with my friend who is also an air hostess, we sit and watch television in the evening or sometimes play cards. 
I collect stamps which I get from different countries. I like being an air hostess because I like aeroplanes.  Words: 97
