If I was now 25, I owuld like to be working for a Dimus. I would like to me a choir master* of a quite large, respectable abbey, Chapel, Cathedral or Church, with a large organ preferably with three to four manuals and about sixty or Eighty stops, including a Spanish trumpet on the swell.
As this is really only a large part-time job, I would like to be an Organ* teacher and to play in other places also.
My interets would be in Music, and Composing music as well as teaching and Cricket. My home life would mainly consist of Gardening*, reviewing music, and watching games on the Television. If my wife liked Pop music I'd probably be rooting out all her pop records and throwing them in the dustbin without mercy and being careful she bought no more!
I might be beginning to look up top prep schools in England to send my children in a few years time. 
I would, (if there was a school attached to my church), I might make sure that the boys were being treated well and give them sunday exeats etc. as most places do not have them.
One thing I most certainly would have would be a choir trial* every year and boys leaving the choir at thirteen, if this was not already happening, as these days boys voices break much earlier that they used to.
I would inforce rules and regulations on the choristers and try to get them very well disciplined.  Words: 247
