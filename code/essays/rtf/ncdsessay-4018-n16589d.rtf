I am 25 years old and I am now married and have two children [name] and [name]. One of my main interests Is to get a new job at [factory] about 38 yards down the road. The job I have at the moment is at a casino called [casino]. My home life is very good but about three weeks ago I had a quarrel with my wife but now its alright. During the next couple of weeks I'm going to redecorate the two bedrooms. One of my friends offered to help me. I hate today because the rent man comes and he collects xxxx26 every two months. He collects the money because just about two weeks ago we bought a Super Ice Fridge which cost xxxx104 and we just have to pay another xxxx52. My wife says we need a new washing machine as well but finacially I don't agree with her, because I mean we've only had the first one for just over 2 years. We've got two pets in the house Arthur the mouse and Mac the small Scottish terrier. For tea tonight I think I'll have some fish and chips followed by some coffee and biscuits (chocolate of course.) Ever since I was a small boy of three I loved chocolate biscuits and I always will I expect. [name] my eldest child will be 5 next week but [name] is only one and a half. Every tuesday I got to my karate club where I am a yellow belt.  Words: 252
