It was my twenty fifth birthday on the 6th March, I was sitting down watching television when I saw a beauty contest and I thought I would like to go in for that kind of thing, but after thinking long enough I decided that was not the thing for me. So I thought again and I thought I would like to be in charge of a horse riding school and go in for horse shows and go trekking. I decided I would like to do that, but before I could do that I would have to earn some money so I got a job in a supermarket for about 5 years until I had enough money to start a riding school. In my spare time I would polish the bridle and all the other things that need to be polished. If I could not do that wouldn't mind having a hairdressers shop and do hairdressing but that would cost a lot of money as well. But I did that I would still like to go horse riding on a sunday I wouldn't mind being a typist to get the money for being a hairdresser or for buying horses to owen a riding school.  Words: 203
