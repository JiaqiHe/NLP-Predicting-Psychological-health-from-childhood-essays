I am 25 years of age and I am working in [company], there I work in the offices facing the road going to [town]. In football I play for [football club] in goal. We mostly play at our own ground every saturday. I am not marryed but I am intending to do so. My hobbies are racing in car races, and trying to win them, did Swimming in the river. Soon I think I am going to migrate to Australia for 10 years. Because I am getting bored of living here because it is not a place for Adventures for instance Boating is not done here because hardly anyone has got one, Swimming here is not done by other people only I and my mate go Swimming here. The water is a bit* dirty but its okay for me to Swim in.  Nown and again I usually go hoarse riding in the farm up the nant by [farm]. When I get to Australia I am going to live in a bungalow hald hope that I will have a sutible job like working in a office. My favirite Booeks are Mystory and Innaganietion, King Soluman's mine, and Dr Jykle and Mr Hide. I like hearing and vieving birds.  Words: 207
