I am married to a photographer. I stay at home to do the housework and to take my two children to school. Of an evening I would cook a meal for them. Some evenings I would get a babysitter to loot after the children and I would go out with my husband. Some weekends I would like to go swimming with my family. I would often read and watch the tele. Fridays I would go out and get my weekly shopping. I would like to belong to club for women where we could go once a week and talk to each other. If the children have a holiday I would take them to the park or playground. I think I would enjoy this kind of life especicilly if all went well, the children were healthy and happy and my husband was enjoying my cooking. Perhaps sometimes I would do some ladys hair, Have a dog and some other pets. I would really enjoy myself.  Words: 164
