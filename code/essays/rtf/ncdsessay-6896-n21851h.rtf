I am now 25 years old and am married. I work as an Electrician for the county so if anyone says thev'e got something wrong with their lights or conection plugs I go and fix it. But know things have changed since I was a little boy of 11, now you can get about a thousand pounds wages a week, and it would be like getting 11 pounds a week when I was a boy. Lots of things have changed now because if you kill someone or do something very wrong you will be sent to a diffrent planet for a life sentence. 
When I was a little boy I thought that you would get sort of vitamin pills for food and that it would be a horibul time but it is really great in the year 1983. There are no telephones now you only have radios and now if you are ill that some day you will be well again, these are just some wonderful things in the year 1983.  Words: 171
