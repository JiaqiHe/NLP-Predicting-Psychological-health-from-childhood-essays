When I am 25 years old I would like to get married have 3 or 4 children. And Im hoping to be a profesonel footballer and play for Spurs. If I could'nt get that job I would like to start a club which would be called looking at birds. Ihave been very inrected in metle work and would like to work in a farm which has machines which all have somthing to do which metel. And I would not be to hard on my children and I would give them 5 shillings a week for pocket money and if they spent it all I would give them 2 shillings extra I would not let my children mix with overs who get in trouble alot. My children will go to a school were there are good mannard people and when they live school I will send them to collage or unavertse if they want to. I would have a house in the country and enjoy my life. When I am older I will yetier and go and live in a cottage in the coutry and live all my happy years they.  Words: 190
