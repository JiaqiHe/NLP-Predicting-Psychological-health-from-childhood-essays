I am in the army we are on our way to the asult corse. It's my turn for the tarzan swing, plouing through the water. After we finished, we had dinner. Then we were split up into two groups, one had red bands, and the other had Blue bands. Blue bands which was my group was to hide and the reds had to find us. A long time after the reds came, we was all right we were hiding then we fired blank and won. F or tea we had fish and chips. Later on we was allowed to take a walk out of army bondris. Tomorow we are gowing home for a mounth to see our famales. During that mounth it was christmas and th*t was why we were gowing home to see our famalies.  Words: 136
