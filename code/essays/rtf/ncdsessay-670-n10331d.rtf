When I am twenty five I hope to be married. I would like to be a nurse, hair dresser, or a stable owner. I would like to have a golden labradore. I think my hobbies would be looking after animals, keeping horses, and swimming. If I am not married at the age of twenty-five I think I would like to marry a man with out glasses with out a berd and a mistosh and who doesn't smoke. I would like to travel a bit like to New Zealand for about four or five months. I think the best job I would like to do would be to be a nurse I would find looking after people interesting. I don't think I would mind being a hair dresser or a stable owner but I think I would prefere being a nurse.
I think when I am twenty five I would like to also travel to Australia and America I would only stay in a hot counry for a little while abot 1 month or may be two.  Words: 175
