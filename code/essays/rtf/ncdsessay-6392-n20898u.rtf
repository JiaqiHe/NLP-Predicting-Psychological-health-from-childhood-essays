Today I am twenty five. I am married with one child. We are emigrating tomorrow we are going to Australia. I hope we go for I live in dirty surrondings near the pit. My husband works down the pit. I live in a small council house which is not really easy to clean becaus my husband comes in the house in his dirty pit clothes and [male name] (my son) comes in with his muddy feet trample's all over the carpet after playing football with his freinds. The only time I get some rest is on Friday when [male name]'s at school and my husbands at work and I've finished housework. I think the worst day of my life are mondays when it is no douby washdays. I wash in a morning then peter comes home from school and wants his dinner right in the of me washing. and after the washing there's the ironing to do. But I dont always have housework to do because every Saturday or Sunday sometimes both we all go for a ride in my hubsands car. one of my interesting hobbies is pony trekking. I often go horse riding. On monday to firday I lead a dogs life on saturday and Sunday I lead a princesses life. Today we are as busy as ants packing, sorting out, throwing things away what we won't need selling things and we are very excited. When we get to Australia I hope to get a job and settle down and find a nice quiet house in the country.  Words: 260
