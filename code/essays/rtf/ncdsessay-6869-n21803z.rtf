I am 25 years old and Im leading a good life. my job is being in the marines training some new recrutes to be commandoes. My intrest is going out and watching football on telly if there playing away but if theyr at home I watch them play at their own Grounds. When I get home I cook my own tea and wash up and dry after I have done this I sometimes go out to my friends or watch television until eleven o clock then go to bed. In the summer I would go to Singapore on a holiday to get some rest from my work. In the marines you have to go to other countries sometimes, so youve got to be ready. Also you have to be fit just in case you are sent out to fight. I also have interest in reading and going to the pictures and playing Golf. Another intrest is going swimming down the beach in the summer and in an indoor bath in the Winter. I would like to travel round the world as well. If I went to an Island I would go by boat because I like the water and the food on the boat. I would get stamps from other countries and make a great big book with stamps from other countries like Canada or Malta.  Words: 226
