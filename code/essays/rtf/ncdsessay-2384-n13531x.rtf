What interests me most is my home life which is swimming, swimming is my hobby realy I often go swimming now that I left school I would get a job the job I would get is being a hairdreseer I would like to travle about the world but unfurely I have not got enough money I would also get marrid my job would mean a lot to me I would have a nice little house and I would go swimming in my spare time or to the pictures I would have quite a happy life, the one thing in my life that would make me unhappy is paying the bills I would have some animals the animals I would have are two collie dogs and some budgies and some fish because I like animals we have'nt got no animals at home we did have cats fish and budgies and my nans got some dogs. I would not smoke because it is two expensive and its a waste of money, and some people die of cancer. I would get some nice clothes and shoes if I can afford it. the type of house I would to live in is two bedroomed one dinning room one sitting room and a bath room tiolet and a kichen I would like my house to be near the shops because if it is far away I would have to walk or bus every time I wanted to go to the shops, I would keep my house nice and tidy. the colour of my frount door would be a light blue if I was a good swimmer I was thinking of going to be in the olimpics but I am not good enough, still I am quite happy being a hair dresser I would do my own hair and I would do my mum's hair for her I would do it free for mum I would cook some lovely cakes and I would make lovley apple pies.
