I walk to the station and then catch the 0800 train. This takes me to [station] where I get off. I then walk to a Taxi and take one to where I work. I work in a Goverment Laboulatry analising petrol one day oil the next and something after that. The taxi coasts 2s 6d a day. After the taxi ride i go and collect a slip of paper which tells mewhat to analise. Then I go into my laboat*t*y and spend to rest of the day on it. After work a walk back to the station and catch my train home. I do not have to buy a train ticket every day as I buy a Season ticket every month.
      When I get home I have my super and then take a rest for 5 min utes. Next I washup and then go into my work shop and do a bit of wood work At the moment I am making a new chest of draws of ply wood. I have made two draws and the frame and soon hope to make the two other draws. I have a kind next door naibour called Mrs [name] who I have a key with and she puts my milk in the fridge and also put the bread in. At the moment I live at [address] but, hope to soon move as the house is going to be pulled down and re biult but, I hope my chest of draws is finished by then so it can be taken as part of the furnisher to my new house in the removeal van.
