I am at the age of 25. And I live on a chicken farm. Every morning about half past eight I go over there to work, and the heat is about 90' when the chicks are young. I start in house number 1. I start by filling the feeders and washing the drinkers. At about 10 o clock I come over and make a cup of tea. After that I go back to work I am finished about halfpast eleven to twelve o clock.
After dinner I tidy the house up and then I go to see to the horse.
Every Friday night I go to town square in the car. 
After nine weeks the chicks are ready to be caught. Somebody has to get up in the morning about two o clock.
In the holidays in the summer, [name] a relief manager brings a caravan and stays at the back of the houses. When We come back there will be another crop to come in.  Words: 163
