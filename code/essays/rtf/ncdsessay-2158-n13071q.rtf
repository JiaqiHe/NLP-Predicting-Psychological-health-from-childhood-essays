If I was 25 I would be married about about 4 years ago and would have two children both girls. I would live in a bungalow near the country side and my job would be a hair dresser or a dancing teacher. In my spare time I would look after pets and animals. I'm interested in dancing and I would like to be a ballet teacher most of all I would give up ballet at the age of about 35 then take up hair-dressing. 
I would have got married at the age of 21 at this age I would give up ballet for a couple of years becausing of looking after the children then go back again at about at the age of 23. I would learn to drive a car so I could go any where I wanted to. Without having to go on the bus. I would have a dog so if my huspand went out one night I would have a dog to protect us from thiefs. I'd make sure that there were a few more houses or bungalows around so I could make some friends of about the same age as I was. I would take up dress making if I could not get a hair dressing job.
