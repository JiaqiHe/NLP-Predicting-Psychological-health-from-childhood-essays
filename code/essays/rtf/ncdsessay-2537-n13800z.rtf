"I get up in the morning have a cup of tea then go down stairs. I cook my own breakfast because I like it a certen way.
At eight o'clock I walk down to the station get on a train an go to Kensington, from there I walk to the Anti Locust Research Center. Once I am inside I take of my coat, put on a white plastic mack and go in to the laboritry. Their I pick out a few Locusts from a cage. I am going to mesure how much grass they eat in a day, so I put them in a cage with fresh grass in it
At five o'clock that evening I stepped on a train and came to [London suburb] Station, from their I walked home.
After tea I go up to my bedroom to get on with my Spitfire, it is a three foot long remote controled plane and I am makeing it from a kit I sent off for.
My bedroom has my bed in oncorner and a cupboard next to it, on the other side are my drawers wich are cramed full of, ""Airfix"" models and next to that in my big trunk I got from Arabia, that is full of books.
I got the trunk as I went to Arabia for a year. In Arabia it is hot, stuffy and mosceto infested and the locusts are in big cages around the grounds. The only grass their is is the grass we feed the locusts on. 
Wilst I was their Iernt to speek aribic quite well and so I could comunicate with the people working their."  Words: 269
