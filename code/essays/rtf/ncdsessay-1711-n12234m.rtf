Some people think I am nice and some think horrible because I am a policeman, my lodgeing are just outside London in a little village. Each morning I catch the 6'o'clock bus and off to work I go I usually arrive in London at about quarter to seven I than get the tube to the police HQ. It is a quiete tiering job walking all the time and controling the traffic, work ends at six at night and I get the tube again and then catch the bus home, when I arrive at my lodgeings there is a hot meal waiting for me on the table, I don't go to work on Saturday or Sundays I usually take my bike and set of for a picnic in the wood or else I would take a bus and go to Birmingham and whats going on. Quiet often on a Saturday I will go home to [village] to my own home I usually stay there Saturdays and Sundays. A very serious accident has happened and I am the nearest one there and this is on a Saturday my holiday so I have to attend the accident. The Sergent rang me up and said I you attend the accident today you will not have to go to work on Monday. My main intrests are still coin and stamp collecting and this is how I expect my life will carry on.  Words: 237
