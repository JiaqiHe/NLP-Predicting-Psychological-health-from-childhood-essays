I am a sheep farmer and I get up at 7 oclock and feed the sheep, and then go for my brekfasd. After my brekfasd I jump in to my landrover go and get some milk from the village milkman. When I am going home I stop at the Garage for some petrol. then I go home I have some horse because you cannot chase sheep in a landrover. I breed ponys for to sellin the sale each month. there is not much money in ponys so I do not do much in them. every summer I enter in the village Jim carner. now Ive told you about wout I do with ponise now I will tell you wout I do on a monday*.
