When I am 25 years old, I should like to work on a farm, because my friend has got a farm and I go and play with her and it seems to be great fun. But I suppose i would not get much money, I might be married then and have got children. When I was very young I used to Say to my mum, when I grow up I Shall be a airostess but as I grew I kept thinking to myself the areoplane might have a crash and then I would be in hospital and I would not be able to do anything except lying in bed with probally two broken legs and a fractured Skull, but lets get off being a airostess now. I would like to go to abroard in sunny Spain because I have never been there before. If I Should have any children I should like twins. Two girls, one name [name] and one name [name]. My mum works at [company] in [district] and my dad works at [company] in [district] the firms are not very far away. I don't really want to be a mother because I have watched my mother working in the house and she never seems to Sit down. She is either washing up dusting or knitting. When I am older I shall Knit a lot of Cardigans for my children and wollen suits. I can't think of much else now for when I am grown up so I will leave it.  Words: 252
