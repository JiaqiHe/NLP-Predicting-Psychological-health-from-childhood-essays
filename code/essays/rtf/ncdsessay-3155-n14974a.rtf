I going to leave colledge and take up work about astronamy, and I am married. It will be our holiday time for three weeks in Spain or some other warm country I'll go by ship to France then by car to Spain if I go to Spain, I dont realy want to go by plane because it isent too safe to go by. and also I wouldent see any thing like famous buildings. In Spain I wouldent go camping in a typical camping sight were every one eles can be nosey about what you do and there are a lot of snakes which are probaly poisinous, they could crawl up you when you sleap but I wouldent mind just camping in the woods were there no one else but me and my wife and I have a tent with a bottom on it and also a Strong zip so that no snakes can crawle in. I'll go hunting for eatable birds which I could roast over a fire.  Words: 168
