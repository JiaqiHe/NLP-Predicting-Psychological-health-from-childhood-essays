I am 25 years old I have a good job. I do not spend much time at home because I travel a lot abroad. At the moment I have a job as corpral in the army. There is a lot of drill and hard work in it but we do have some pleasure time we go to the pictures and have dances. I don't mind getting up at 5 o'clock but the best bit I recon about the army is going to bed in the evening. There's plenty of food to eat. There's a lot of spit and polish in the army we have to clean our boots till we could use them as a mirror. Buckles have to be polished. This all has to be done by role call at six o'clock. Then we have drill and guard duty for the rest of the morning and combat training in the afternoon. I write letters to my parents and send them by air mail. I'l be going on leave soon then I'l go home to see them all.  Words: 178
