I am an arcetect I have just come out of Univercity. I have a house in or near the country I am still interested in the same subjects as before I climbing more now. My house I hope to design myself and even make it myself. I either* want to do that or I want to be in a satalite relaying station. I also want to have a car. A good one with enough power to get me somewhere. When I get a house I would want it to have two bedrooms so that friends could spend the night there. Also I would like to go camping and go out to places. I would see if I could go all round England visiting all the famous places. After that I may try and go abroad. I would like to go to Australia and America and visite Yellowstone Park thats if I could get enough money to do so.  Words: 158
