When you are 25 you can be single or married. You can go to work where ever you want if you dont go to work you have to go to a place where you get some money If you go to work you have got to work hard if you don't you will not get any money. If you are single you have to get your own tea ready. If you go to work and you are single you should have loads of money. If you go to work a half past seven and you have got a coal fire you have to light the fire but if you have a gas fire you jsut come down a light it. If you go to a University, it is just like ordinary school.  Words: 132
