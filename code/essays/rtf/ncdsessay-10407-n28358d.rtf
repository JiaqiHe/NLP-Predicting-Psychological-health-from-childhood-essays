I would like to just be an ordinary house-wife and have about 2 children Both girls.
My life would be busy. until my children went to school then it would be much easier as I wouldnt have them at home all day .
At about 4 oclock the would arrive home and Imediately want their tea so another rush had started, to get their tea ready.
I would have learnt to drive a car Do that I could take them dropping and that type of things. Saturday would be the biusiest day of the week. And Sunday I hope would be quite qiuet.  Words: 100
