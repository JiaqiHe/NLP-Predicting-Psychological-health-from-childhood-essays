I will pobabaly be florist or a nurse who looks after children. I will get married and have a few children. We will buy two cottages and make it into one large house. It will be in [county] all alone, down a rough lane. There will be plants all over the house and loads of pets to keep us company. I will call one of my children,(if its a boy,) [name]. The pets will be two dogs both will be very large but well trained. The garden will probably first look like a jungle, but I will make my husband get a motor mower and dig a large bed for flowers. I will plant rose bushes and there will be a few trees here and there. The furniture will be fairly modern and I will make sure the carpet does not show much dirt. If there are any clubs I will probabaly join some.  Words: 154
