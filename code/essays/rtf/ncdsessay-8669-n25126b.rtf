I am still working for British Rail as I have been for four years But now I am a signal man which is a bit difficult but with the new signal box its a lot easea for I only have to push butons and not pull levers I control one part of [town] station and my colege controls the other. A lot of trains from france that come across on the britist rail fery come through [town] on their way to london And I am glad to say I have not caused eny Acidentes All though a goods train broake the doors on The engin shed but that was the drivers fault not mine.
