I am leading a good life there are intresting things when you grown up there are places to go and things to do. When I go to work I might be a shef and earn money for my wife and I. I would also like to be a pilot. I would buy a house and I would go to Spain for 3 weeks. If I am a shef I will go to **** and train. then I will cook in a cafe or on a cruiser, then I will fly to **** spend a few days there and then fly back. Then I will get another job as a engin driver then when I finish that job I do not know what to do them, then I will stay in England. I will have 2 children and then get them to school to work.
