When I am 25 years old I hope to be an enginer and when I have plenty of money I will get maryed. I would like to be an enginer in a garadge mending cars. Then I will by a car perhaps a Zephir or a Cortina. The pay I get a week is 25 pounds, some times I go to a club called the six stars. There are dancers, singers, and some times there are clowns, the best I like is the singers. The club closes at eleven o'clock. In the morning when I get up I have to be at the garade at 8 o'clock so I get up at 7 o'clock. When I get at the garadge I start mending the cars, then I finished it. There were seven more cars to be done so I started on them it was half past twelve when I finished then I had my dinner. When I got back the garadge had been closed for the afternoon so I went. I did not go home I went to the pub for a pint of biter. Then I went home, it was a sunny day so I asked my wife if she wanted to go to the beach and she said yes so we went when we got there the beach was nearly full up, so we went to a part of the beach and at down, I went strate into the water the water was warm. I was in the water for four minutes because the water was getting hotter and I do not like hot water then when had a drink of coffee, then we went home. It was half past eight when we got home then I went to bed for an early night.  Words: 296
