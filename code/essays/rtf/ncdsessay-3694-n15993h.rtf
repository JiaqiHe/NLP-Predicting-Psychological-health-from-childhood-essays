When I am 25 I will hope to live in a bungalow and garge for my two cars. I will hope to have 3 children with a handsome husband like Cliff Richards. I would like two girls and a boy. I would name them Sarah, Carol and Bruce. My husband would work in a famous bank in London. I would live in Dover. My furniture would be model I will hope to have a big garden for my children to play in.  Words: 82
