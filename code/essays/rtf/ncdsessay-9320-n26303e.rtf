----------------------
I live in a nice pretty house in the country side. It has a mediam size garden. 
I am engaged, to a nice young girl. Every day I go to work in [auto manufacturer] Car Factory, which is about a mile from my home.
I've got a Vauxall, which I have just bought.
In my spare time, I go sailing on the river tye, which runs just by my house. If it is raining, I do carve bits of wood into varius things. 
I've got a very nice houskeeper, who, sometimes helps me do gardening.
The house itself has 4 bedrooms, two barthroom, a dinning, a sitting room, a study, one big garage. The garden is about two acres, it has a shed, a little gold fish pond, the gold fish pond is made out of cement, and is above the ground. My home is by a small village, The nearest, town, city, or village to this, is about ten miles away. Some times, I go to the golf club to practise. I play golf for this village.
When I have enough free time I go and visite my Relations. On hot summer days, I go swimming in a friends swimming, which is quite big.  Words: 201
