If I were 25 I would like to be a nurse. I would like helping old people too. I would do this because I take care of my gran & grandad. Before this I would like to be a hair stylist, then I would be able to give my mum & aunts' home perms. I would have to stay in the hospital if I was not married. If I was not, I would at the weekends or days off go to the caboraigs* or disqueteques. If I was nursing away from home I would go home when I could. I would like to have watched old people in homes as well as in hospital. I would take a two year coarse, and then go for a trip if I could save some money in that 2 years training. If Biafra was like it is now I would go there to help the women & children and take food and medicine for them. I would be older now and maybe would still have my mother and father by then and I would have liked them to know the good I had done.  Words: 191
