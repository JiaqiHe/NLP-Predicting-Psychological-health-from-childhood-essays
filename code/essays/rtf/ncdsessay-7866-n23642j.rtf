This year for our holiday we a hoping to go on a cruise in the Norfic-brods. My husband says that I need a good rest because of me working so hard when I have got a baby to deel with some times I agree with him, I get so worked up aspeasly with it being a hot summer, besides that I feel very happy with our small family. My Mother comes and visits me every Monday and helps me with my house, if my husband comes home early he somtimes takes us out for a ride we bothe helped pay for the car but I carnt drive. The colour my hair always used to be a very dark brown which some pepole said was black but now it's light brown.  Words: 223
