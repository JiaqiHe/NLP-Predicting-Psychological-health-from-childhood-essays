1984?               I am 25 years old now and a teacher in a grammar school at the north-east 3 years ago I left University having taken my Science degree, And having decided not to live with my parents. I have a nice flat in town Where I am living with a few pals Not being married I have plenty of time for for my Intrests. Which are, painting and Drawing, chess reading good books and travelling to places of Intrest. As a matter of fact I have just returned from a trip to the moon. The world airline has a regular Service to the moon these Days. As Archeaology and fossils are my greatest hobbies this trip to moon was great I will never forget It. Things have changed a lot Since I was a lad and Its very exciting. The flat I live In is a terrefic difference from the old Council house I used to live In. We have portable couler televisions about 3ins by 2ins With 9 Stations. We have a big Computer Which you only need to press a button and you can have any food you desire In an Instant also the chairs you can drive around the flat. The food is little tablets or blocks Wich are just as tasty and as Nourashing.  Words: 218
