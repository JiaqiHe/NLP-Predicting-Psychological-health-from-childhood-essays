I am 25 years of age. I am married. My job is a shop assistant. I get hours of from work; Wednesday afternoon, all of Sunday, special days (like Christmas) and bank holidays. The price of goods is very expencive now. The cost of an orange is 3 new pence, and that is only for a small one. I have one child so far, who comes as a bit of a nuisance, But then he is only 2. House work is easier than what it was in the past with all the mechanisims that a kitchen now has. Some times the stoves and automatic machines get out of hand, so maybe kitchen furnitures and that are some how better. My interest is on Sundays to go out to places in the country where it is quiet and peaceful, much better than the noisy machines of the town, which are growing rapidly. Cars have been modernized in several ways. Ships are not so common for hovercrafts are now coming into use. Many, though, are used as passenger ships  Words: 177
