I lead a quite normal life. The children aren't much bother. While I am at work I send them to a nursery. I am a vets assistant on Saturdays. Week days I work with the R.S.P.C.A. I take a great intrest in animals, although sometimes when animals are very badly injured I am very sorry for them, and it makes me feel a bit sick. I am paid forty seven pounds a week. I go out at nights sometimes with my husband [male name]. We go to a quiet night club. I do not use transport very often. I like walking long distances. I make lots of clothes for my children as I do a lot of sewing and knitting in my spare time. I enjoy watching television.  Words: 128
