My age in 25 and I am in the army I enjoy myself a lot and am hardly ever at home because in the army you travel all over the world and never get home. The only time I am at home is when I am on leave and even then I am not on leave very long. I collect stamps which I have been doing since I was about ten years old. When I am traveling over the world with the army I get a lot of foreign stamps. I also camp a lot when I am on leave in the summer. I do bird watching a lot as well and I have a hide in my back garden. I live in a small house in the country with my mother and father. The house is not very far for the army camp I go to. I use a motorbike to get around and keep it in a garage besdie our house. Somtimes we go camping with the army in different countrys and bring a lot of presents back for our friends. When I have nothing else to do I go climbing because there is no cliffs near our house and I go there. I am corparal and somtimes have to put the soldiers on courses which some of the new ones get stuck. Apart from some problems I lead a happy life.  Words: 234
