My name is Mr. [name]. My work is on a farm with the  cows fat* cattle and sheep to feed. The cows have their cake and barley* when they come in for milking I milk one cow for the house and the other cows for suckling the calves. The fat cattle have cake. barley and beet pulp. After the cattle have grown big and fat I sell them two at a time to the butcher for meat. The sheep only have food in winter when there is not much grass. In the summer they don't have any food because there is a lot of grass about In spring when the sheep are lambing we bring them closer to the farm. Whne the lambs start growing they start to graze. when the lambs are old enough they are weaned and put in a field by themselves. Then they are fattend up so when they are old enough I either sell them at the market or sell them to the butcher. Sometimes I draw out 30 or 40 ewe lambs for to keep for sheep the next year. In the spring wen plant the crops such as barley, turnips, kale swedes and clover. The crops Grow and when they are big enough we combine the corn. and pull up the turnips and so on.  Words: 222
