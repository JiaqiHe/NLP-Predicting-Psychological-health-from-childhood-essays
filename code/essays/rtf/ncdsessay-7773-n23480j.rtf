Seeing that I am a test pilot my wife has many trying occassions , because I am often late home from work.
I enjoy being a pilot because flying in a plane has always given me a thrill. It's safe too . There is an ejector seat and all the other safety devices in the super-sonic jet I am now testing. The only real thing I don't like is the canteen tea! Even through I am twenty - five I still collect Dinky cars because since I was ten I loved toy cars. Because I can speak French, German and Russian I have great delight in travelling through forgein lands. Even if I lose my job as a pilot I can turn to crime as I can pick locks and open safes. But with nine - thousand pounds a year salary I can live in luxury until I find another job. I go to two evening classes one on enginering and the other on Spanish so by the time I've finished the classes I should be an attractive prospect for (place)
My wife and I have lots of friends .and we have had many parties and have gone to even more . So far I have seen the birth of (name) and (name) our two children and my wife is expecting more . Each time I board a plane my children are always worried but the wife knows that Ill come out alive.
Nowadays I can remember my days at school .  Words: 249
