I am stopping in a Hotel and getting ready for the FA Cup. The hotel we are stopping in is luxuriously furnished The moment came and we got on the coach when we arived they were shouting Leeds United and Liverpool and various other types of vulgar songs. The two captains spun up and Billy Bremner won the toss We kicked off and passed out to the wing. Cheers ran out as [name] sped towards the goal then a long swerving pass inward and [name] jumped and clutched the ball. Then a long hard Kick on to the wing back in the centre. The centre half hit it tremendously and it just dropped in front of [name] which rammed it. [name] made a desperate attemt which he hit out and then [name] Belted it again and then He* scored a beatiful goal which hit the left hand post and then went in Thousands cheered. The score remainted like that till the last ten minutes' from the end when [name] scored from a header from a long ball across when [name] headed it in. The dying minutes were left then I got possession of the ball and a quick body swerve and I hit the ball as hard as I could the ball soared through the air [name] had no chance Then the final whistle blew and I had won the cup for Leeds United.
