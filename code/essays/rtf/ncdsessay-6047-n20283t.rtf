When I am Twenty - five . When I am twenty - five I would like to be married and have a family of two. I am a short, hand typist to a manager of a firm of some sort. Also I would like to imigrate to South Australia, because I have and auntie living there too . I would like very much to teach children swimming in my spare time . I would make alot of my own childrens clo thes since I am very intrested in dress designing . I would very much like my husband to work on land and not in the navy , army , or air men . My house would be a bungalow with no up s tairs in it, a small front garden with flowers and a neat back garden for drying clo thes or the children playing in it . In week - ends I would go walks and read when all the things are washed . dryed , and put away dust the house and have a seat . I like mistery or adventure books , but travel books bore me . I do hope I have not got far to go to my work . I would have a small car with my hus band and me being able to drive it . I do not like long drives its upsets my stomach . I would also have a bank , book , and put so much a week in it . Australia is a sunny country so you would not have the weather you get in Scotland., It would help the washing dry quicker , and would save time for o ther things . In (place) is a ship yard the same as the one ov er in (place) It is impor tant that you get a good job . Only if you have good qualifications in school . One more thing is if you imigrate you might get sunstroke, because Scotland is a cold country and Australia is a hot country .  Words: 345
