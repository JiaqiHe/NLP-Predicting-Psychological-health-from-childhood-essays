"I am a proffesor in arcaeology and live in londen, at the moment I am working on the ""man before Homo Havils"" in a few weeks time I am going to the yuckon trail *o look for traces of early man, I get up early every day and go to the collage. I leave for home at six o'clock in the evening and go to a reastraust for my tea. Three weeks ago I went to peterbourgh to help in the excavation of the *mars* pottery works there when I get home from collage at night I read books on arcaeology. I am trying to write one, ** about ""Homo Habils"" (or handy man). 
     I still spend some time on my coin collection, (my speciality is Roman coins). I have opened a coin shop next door to my house, which my brother looks after. The Royal mimimatists* club has chosen me as their chairman. 
     I have sold all my vi*onana and militare as I have nowhere to keep them."  Words: 171
