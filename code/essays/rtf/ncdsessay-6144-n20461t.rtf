I am a MP in the Royal Air Force. My work is hard but I enjoy it. At the moment I am on day duty which is from 7.00 am till 7.00 pm My hobbies are stamp collecting. Australia (which I want to visit) and Reading. I am married and have Two children aged 4 years and 3 years. At night when I get back home. (which is on the carapl*.) I have my dinner and then sit down or either read or watch telivison. On my days off I sometime work in the garden, or go into the nearest town [town]. My worst job is night juty because the only person you meet is the sargeant or the night gateman. Perhaps I meet another police man doing his rounds on the Camp During the day when I am on day duty I sometimes see planes landing and taking off. once there was a crash and I had to help find the bodies of the pilots and crews. There was not one survivor of that crash. The two planes that crashed were a fuel carrier and a hawker harrier that had just taken of at Marlow. That evening I was still looking for the bodies. but was relieved by another Mp. Another time I was doing my rounds on night dutie when I saw a padlock was undone. I called the sargeant of the watch and we both went into the building. Inside we foind nothing and said it was an act of carelessness by the NCO In charge of the building. at home I have a garden full of lovely flowers during spring and summer. I like gardening and stamp collecting best.  Words: 283
