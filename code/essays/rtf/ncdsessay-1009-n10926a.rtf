I am now twenty-five and my marrid name is Mrs [name]. I do not go out to work as I have two twins at home. They are called [name] and [name]. My new address is [address]. I often take [name] and [name] down too the park for a little walk. I love planting and watching the flowers grow. I sometimes make home-made bread to save a little bit money. I go to church on a morning for Holy Comunnium and on a evening. I take our dog for walks, and spend some of my spare time knitting matinee coats for the twins, and clothes for [name]'s dolly. It is now nearly summer and I will soon be buying a little bucket and spade for each of the twins. Next week I will be taking them to the day. Now it is the first week in July. I am taking *[name] for a new coat and some summer dresses. [name] is getting a new suit to wear. Before long it will be the twins third birthday. The Sunday after next is the birthday party. I am leaving the twins with my friend so that I can order the cake and by their presents. I go to dressmaking classes. Now it is the day before the party I am busy making little cakes and scones. I am getting a bit bored so I am taking a part time job. I will be on a six month course then I might take the job as a whole time job. The neighbour next door looks after the twins.  Words: 264
