When I am 25 years old I will most likely go in the navy or make modeles. I will have a house and get married.   I will have pets and I dont think I will have children. For my holidays I would like to go abroud if I had the money but if not, I would traval over British ils.   If I did go in the navy and I could not get home to see my wife I would write letters to her. I would try to get a house in the country but near a town so that it would be easy to go shoping. I would try to get a car again if I had the money. I would read book sometimes and read the newspapers. For my passtimes I would model ship and then take them to the nearest pound [pond] and see if they would sail or not.   I would have a television and a lot of books in a book in a book case.
