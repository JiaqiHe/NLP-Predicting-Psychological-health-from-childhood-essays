"This year before I get married I am going to go round the country's like Europe, Italy, Spain, and Switserland then I will go back to london where I am living now and find a wife and have some children and wait till they are about 6 years old and then have some holidays with them but I wouldn't take them as far as I went on till they were about 9 to 10 years old, I am working in Westminster Bank now and i get good wages. when I was small I was wishing I could play for Manchester United but all I am now is a trainer for Leeds United which is quite exciteing because i sit right at the front of the crowd. My children like it to because when I go to train the men my children get piggy-back rides on the backs of the men and keep on getting there autographs because they support them my little boy [name] has got a scarf, Bobble hat, tie, Jumper, socks, and Leeds United bag, and my little girl [name] has got the same exept the socks she has got gloves.
We have got a flat, a car, my 15 year old boy has got a motor bike, which is a honda, make fun of him by saying the his wheel has come off and so he rushes to the garage and looks for his bike and he can't find it and says ""oh no I've got to meet my girl friends on it tonight"" so I tell him where it is."
