At the age of twentyfive I worked in a large office right in the city of (place). As , (place) was a very busy town I went to my work by car . On Saturdays when I have nothing to do. I go to the icerink with my two children (name) and (name). Then on Sundays we all go to church. Then it's back to work for another week On the tuesday As I was sitting at my desk I remembered that the very important letter which was to be sent away yesterday was still lying on my desk so I took it to my boss and told him I had forgotten to send it way he then told me he would just write a letter to them. On the friday when I had finished work. one of my old friends, had come to meet me , I asked her how she liked her new job she told me that she liked it very much. On Saturday when I was on my way home I suddenly remembered that I had a holiday for the next seven weeks so that means I will be going away to Spain .  Words: 198
