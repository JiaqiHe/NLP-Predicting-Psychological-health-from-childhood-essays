I have joined the R.A.F and I have good pay. I am thinking about asking to be posted to a squadron where they use lightnings. I have been to germany, greece and many other countrys. And if I can I am going to get married. But as yet I have not met the right girl. I am saving up to get a flat and even a house if I can find a nice cheap one, they are going to put up a block of flats near the aerodrome and if they are not to expensive I shall try to get one.
