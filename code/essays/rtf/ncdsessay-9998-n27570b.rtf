I live with my parents in a little cottage in the country. Down the road there is a little village where I work in a little sweet shop, with my friend [name]. She is married and has got one child, called [name]. I have a sister who is nineteen who works in the bread shop next door. In my spare time I go and visit* some old friends of mine. On Saturday nights I go to the cinema, with my friends, and on Sunday afternoons we all go hiking. In the summer we have a carnivil and a fair its good fun. In the winter we go sledging in the fields with all the children. Sometimes we ho on holiday in the summer but not often because we would rather stay at home and be with our friends. I would have liked to have been a typist then work in a sweet shop but there are no jobs like that in the village. Its a quite and peaceful village and I enjoy myself here very much. there are lot of entertainments for the children.  Words: 184
