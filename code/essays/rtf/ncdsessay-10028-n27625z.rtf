"First I left my old school and I went to [town] Girls High School From there I got my G.C.E. and 9 ""O"" levels. I went to [town] Training College for teachers and I stayed there for three years. I am now teaching in a small primary school and I teach the forth years who are very naught sometimes I have two children of my own and they attend the same school. My favourite lesson I like teaching is P.E. Every morning I get up at seven o'clock to get some house work done before I go to school. I make my bed and wait for the children to get up. On saturdays I get up at five o'clock to start the washing and I finish about ten o'clock thats if I have got a large wash. If I have a small wash I get up at the same time when I have a large wash and I finish about nine o'clock. In my spare time I go horse riding and show jumping sometimes. At night times I do some gardening or let my husband take me on an unused areodrome so that I can practise driving a car. On some saturdays I go shopping either to [town], [town] or [town]."
