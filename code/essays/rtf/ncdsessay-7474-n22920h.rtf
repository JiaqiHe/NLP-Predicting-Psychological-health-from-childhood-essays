----------------------
I am twenty five years old. I am married and I am a nurse, I have only two children. My next door neibour looks after them when I am at the hospital. I do half day work. There is disciplin needed in a hospital. Nursing is a worth while job. 
      There is a lot of patients in each ward. There are only a few empty beds here and there. The patients come in usualy for checkups but sometimes there is people whose plane has crashed and is suffering from shock.
      The other nurses are friendly which helps to comfort the sick people. The matron is sometimes strict but usual she is very kind. 
      Mainly I work in the childrens ward but often I work in the ward where there is the old people. I work in the afternoon when it is quiet. I go round at night to see if everyone is asleep.
      The doctors are kind to. We have about ten doctors in the hospital. My husband is one of the doctors. If there is one doctor you don't like you soon get to know him and like him better.
      If there is any thing wrong with you (hooping cough, measles ect.) it is best to go to hospital or see your family doctor. If there is any thing wrong and you don't go to hospital it might get worse.  Words: 233
