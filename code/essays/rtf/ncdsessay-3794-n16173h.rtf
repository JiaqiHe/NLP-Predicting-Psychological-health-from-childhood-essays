When I am twenty-five I hope to be playing football for a strong first division club preferably Manchester Utd. I would hope to be playing a forward position. If you are a footballer one thing leads on to another, forinstance by the time ** you were twenty-five you would probably have saved enough money to lead a *** very good life. If I had the choice I would like to live in the country about twenty miles out of a fairly large town. I imagine in the circumstances I have writen about that I would probably be leading a very exciting life, because ofcourse with a footballers pay you could go lots of places even though it was only for a short time even for a couple of days. As a footballers pay stands at the moment, if you join a good club you can earn upto at least xxxx100. I would hope to be married by the time I am twenty-fine x five, and I would hope to have about lher x three or four children, probably two boys and two girls o x or two girls and a lo x boy. I of-course hope that my home life will be very happy. I would hope that my wife would have erary x every modern convienence. I would hope to set up at least one leage record for my club and one for myself. I should hope that my club would be leage champions cup the F.A. cup and the Eauropean Cup at least on x wonce in my carrer. I would also hope that I will be very generous with all that I own. I would also like to own a shop of some sort for when I retire.  Words: 291
