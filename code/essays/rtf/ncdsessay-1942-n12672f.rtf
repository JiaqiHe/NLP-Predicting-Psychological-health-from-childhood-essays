"      I am twenty-five years old I am six feet with dark-brown hair and dark-brown eyes. I am very handsome.
      My occupaition is a Sytems Analist my degree A.B.C.S.. I programe computers. I have had a most frightning expirience when I blew up a computer by mistake I was told to put a punch-card in a different place to where it should go and all was going well. We thought we [company] had beaten all he other companies to a new type of computer. So we went to lunch and celebrated. One of my freinds said ""Dont . count your chickens before they've hatched"". I said ""Ha"" and . we all laughed finished our meal and went back to see what had happened.
      We came in just in time to see it blow up. We rushed back broke the fire-alarm and got every body out of the building.
      The firemen arrived just in time to stop the explosion doing too much damage. It was nonsencical, for what reason did we do it. To show-off seemed the most stupid reason, but it was for that. 
      I wasn't blamed, but it was on my consionce for my life up till now.
      Soon I hope to set up a new life in Israel. I have learnt the language Hebrew since I was four years old and will carry on learning it."  Words: 229
