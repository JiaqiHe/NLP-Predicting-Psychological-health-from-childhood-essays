I am living at Manchester and playing for Manchester United on Saturday I'm playing for Northen Irland. Every night we go on to the pitch and train. I have a bunglow which I live in. My best friend is Bobby Charlton who plays on the same team as me. In my spare time I sometimes wash the car or take it to the gararge. I keep rabbits in the back garden, I have got onley five now for I sold four last week. I have a small shop in Manchester which I sometimes help.  Words: 94
