I am a Sub leitenant in the Fleet Air Aran. At the moment I am on H.M.S Surmes an aircraft carrier. We are in Hong Kong harbour and some of us are just getting ready to go into Hong Kong. That evening in the mess a telagram was sent to me saying that my wife had had her first baby and it was a boy. The next day after a restless night I was on my way home and in 20 hrs time I was home! I immediately went to the nuseing home to see my wife and the baby. After a weak of visits I went back to the ship which then left for Australia. In my spare time I am making a rug for our house in [town]. Some weeks later an aeroplane broke down and as the real enginer was ill I was called in I fixed the plane and soon I was transffered to Yeovil were I became a enginer. Later my wife and son joined me in Yeovil where I lived in the married quaters.  Words: 180
