When I am 25 years old
When I am I 25 I would like to be a hairdresser or a person who makes up poems. I would like two children a girl and a boy and I would like a little country house. I would like it to have four bedrooms a little garden and a car to go to town in. I would like a few rose trees and daffodills. And a little summer house in the garden for the children to sleep in in summer. I would like a Husbend who has a good job and is very kind to people. And I would like a dog and a cat for pets.
