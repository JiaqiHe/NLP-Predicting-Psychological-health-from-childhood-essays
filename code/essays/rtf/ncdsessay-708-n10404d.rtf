I have just started fishing in matches and last week I went to play tennis in the evening. I have joined a swimming club as weel. I live with my mother and father, my father is a bricklayer and he works by himself. My mother is just a housewife. In a few weeks I am taking an exam do be a building inspector. I am earning eighteen pound* a week at the moment but if I am going to be a building inspector i will earn twenty pounds to start with and then it will gradualy rise. Once a week I go to the recreation ground for cricket practice but soon I will be going for football practice.  Words: 151
