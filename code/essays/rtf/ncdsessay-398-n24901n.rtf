At the age of 23 I started demolishing houses and other things I have always wanted to do things like that. I was going to play left-half for Crystal Palace, but another, better player has joined so I am a reserve player I have played 4 times for the Palace, twice at right-half, once at left-half, and once at centre-half. I am not married yet, and I live in a flat in [xxxxxxx]. I have a nice, 1981 sports car. I bought it second-hand, a year ago for £850. You must admit, it is expensive, but in this day and age, 1983, the prices are going up and up with the budgets. By the way, another thing that has kept me out of football is a thigh injury. I was kicked in the muscle, playing against Coventry, in a First Division game. We won 2-1. I am very happy with what I am doing and I hope one day I will be a big football star.  Words: 166
