...have children. I hope I will have a lot of gadgets to do bits of work for me like somthing to turn on the T.V. without getting out of the chair I am sitting in. I also hope I will have a cook, and housemaid. I would like to be going to a university, like my dad. I hope my mum and dad will live near me although I am not sure wether they will. I will always go to mass on sundays and days of obligation. I hope I don't have to get up before 9.30 to go to work. There will be about 5 rooms in my house. I will have a good stereo record player, and hi-fi system. I also have a F.M. receiver with a stereo decoder atackached to it. I think that is all I can say in advance.  Words: 144
