My oldest child is 8 years of age. He wants to be a footballer just like myself. My youngest child is 2 years old. she wants to play Tennis when she is older. We mostly watch Tennis games and football games when I am not at work. I usually get up very early for training. I sometimes take my son with me I think he has a good time. When I come home from work I mostly take my wife out to the Cinama. I hardly ever stay at home. When I do I mostly have a rest. At all other times im mostly giving my son some football practice and my daughter some tennis practice.
