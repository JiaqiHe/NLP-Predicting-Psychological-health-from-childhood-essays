When I am 25 I have intrest in being an artist because I like painting very much.
I would like to have a big house of my own and have children.
My work an artist or a nurse I would like to be an artist first but i f I can not pass my tests in being an artist I would like to try and be a nurse.
for my house I would like a house of my own not a corporation house if i have money to buy one. Altough the corporation house are good as well I would like it out in the country so if I have children they will have somewhere safer at least a bit safer from cars and lorrys .
I would like to have children be-cause I like children very much .
I f I was able to pass the tests as an artist I would be very happy I have seen some wonderful painting from other brilliant artists. I would be a nurse if I couldent pass the test of being an artist because a nurse is very helpful I would like to help people in there illnesses I would not become an nurse till my children are older because i do not want to go out and leave them alone because they would be far to young to leave alone and any you are not supose to leave children alone. I would like to live in the country not because it would be quiet I would like to becuse I think it would be safer for the children to play even thought there would be some traffic coming up and down but it will not be half as bad as on the ordinary roads they would feel safer as well and we could make a little round garden and take little animals with us . And I would like to be an artist because I think if I was to become an artist I would have a good carrer in the future to come and I would like it very much to become an artist I would like it very much indeed and I would like to have a good husband aswell for to look after the children properly i f I have children as I hope I will .
