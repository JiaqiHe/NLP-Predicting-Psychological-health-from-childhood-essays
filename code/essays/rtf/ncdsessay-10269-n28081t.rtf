I am now 25 years old and I am a pilot in the (place). I do not worry very much and I am leading a very happy life. I have a pet otter and he swims in a pool at the bottom of my garden.

I woray sometimes if the plane I am flying in develops engine trouble and I have to do a crash landing. Once I was over the Atlantic Ocean and one of the engines of the plane that I was flying in burst into flames. I had to ditch it in the sea and it must have been six hours before I was spotted.

I am very fond of gliding and I go nearly every weekend to the gliding club. It is a quiet sport with no sound of the engines that you have in an ordinary plane. So you see I live a very peaceful life and I am very happy.  Words: 154
