The work I do is making meals for restraunts In England. Most of the people that come in the restraunt always go out with a full stomach. I start work at nine o'clock in the morning till half past eight at night. I am still a batchelor. I entered a contest for making the best food. The prize was xxxx10,000. The second prize was xxxx5,000 and third was xxxx900. I came second and a boy called [name] came first and [name] came third. With the money I won I bought a semi-detatched house. The house cost xxxx4,000. The walls where neatly plastered. I made friends with a lot of people. With the one thousand pounds that was left I bought bricks to make one part into a cafe. Then I would be able to make pies and sell them and I would be able to make more money.  Words: 148
