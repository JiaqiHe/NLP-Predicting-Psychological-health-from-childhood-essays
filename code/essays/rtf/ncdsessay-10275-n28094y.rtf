"My occupation is cooking dinners on the [ship]. I have only just been accepted because I am twenty five years old to day. I am a ascertent cook, but once in my training I burnt a chicken which I was cooking for Mayor's banquet. This time I am trying not to burn the chicken. The the cheif waiter came in and said ""hurry up cook."" Good now I can have a rest. Good bye Mr. [name] I won't see you in the morning because I will be cooking on the [ship]. When I was about to get in to my car Mr. [name] came rushing out and said good luck. On the way home my car broke down. I looked at the engine and I saw the fan belt had broken so I got my spare one out of the boot and fixed it on. I drove on down the road when a dog jumped into the road I screached to a halt and went through the windsceen. I am fully recoverd now."  Words: 173
