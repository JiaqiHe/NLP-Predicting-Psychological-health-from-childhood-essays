I am now a builders aprentice in a factory I am earning xxxx20. a week half of which I give to my family to help to buy the things they need. I allso live with my family in a small bedroom. My foreman gave me and the other people with me had an asingment do we had to colect a load of Bricks from a site where the lorrys dumped them and so we had the Job of colecting the bricks from the site. I hoped that the foreman had given us somebody to show us where the site is because as a matter of fact nobody in the group new where the site was but as the last few words of the foreman saved our worries because he told us that somebody was going to show us our destination. We usally fineshed work about 4 oclock and it is only a bus ride from here to my home.  Words: 159
