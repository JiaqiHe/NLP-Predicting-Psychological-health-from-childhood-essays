----------------------
I am leading a fairly good life except for taxes and things like that. I like collecting coins stamps and flying. I am an RAF officer. I went through Cramwell before I came to where I am now. I have been stationed by the RAF in singapore, and I would go home when I got leave or a vacation. I am a pilot a a vulcan (A large RAF bomber). I do not like desk work at all I prefure to be out in the open air. I play football for that section which I have been stationed in. I am married and have two small children. Both my wife and children are with me in Singapore. I have a small flat in England which I sometimes go to. I do not travel home but I stay at the RAF station most of the time. When I do go home it is usally for a week end or a vacation. When I go on holiday I go back to England with my wife and children to see my friends and relations. I would probaly have my own private car in which to travel round in. My house in Singapore is a fairly large one. I have cook to relive my wife from the chore of cooking. My house in England would only be a small on enough for four people to live in. I keep most of my own stuff in England except my clothes and other things like that. The taxes in Singapore are not all that high so I have quite a lot of money to spend on myself and my family.  Words: 274
