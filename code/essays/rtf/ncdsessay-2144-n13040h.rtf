At home I am trying to build a shed in the back garden for my prog*cts but I am not having mych sucses. I have a very large rock collection and a lot of coins but I de vote most of my spare time on studying nature which I think is my best study. I have a very nice house with the roof conv*rted in to a ream*. I am also starting to do some carpentry I have made a table, a chast of draws for my best rocks and some picture frames. I have saven* contable prints and four van goth prints among some old second had pictures. yesterday when I came home from the collage I found my kitchen on fire but I got a**g and smother* the flames, I could not of thown water over the flames as it was oil that was burning.
