If I was 25 I would have a wife and 2 children both about 2 years old I would have a three bedroomed house out in the country and work would be a policman I would buy a car not a big one properly a mini. In my sper time I would play alot of football and cricket with my friends and would surport my local football team. I would take my Kids out if there boys I would take them fishing. If they were girls I would give them pretty frocks. I would teach them about god and all about the bibble. I would not smoke or go to the pubs but I would go to alot of dance's. When I buy the house I would decerate it and make it nice and if there were any leaks I would soon fix them. I would help my wife in as many ways as possible, and on some week-ends I would go down to my dad &* mums with my wife and Kids  Words: 173
