I am now 25 years of age I work for the council as a painter. every day I get up at half past seven. I have a cup of tea and go to work. I get to the yard at 8 o clock and start work at half past nearly every Saturday me and my family go to CroyDon to get some shopping. nearly every year we go to Seaford on holiday because it has the sea near by and it is a good place for children to play. It has a swing park near by and a little cafe and shop in the park. We own a big big pen with six chickens in it. we have a big garden at the back and a small garden in the front.  Words: 131
