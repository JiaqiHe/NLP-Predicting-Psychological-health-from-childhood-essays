I am a teacher. Out of school hours I like to go home have my tea then go out with my boyfriend. Sometimes I like to bake and cook, or play records with my friends. I am very fond of teaching and like children. The favourite subject that I like to teach them is geography.
I stay in a flat of my own and I always go to see my parents at the week-end. I left my parents when I started teaching at the age of 23.  Words: 86
