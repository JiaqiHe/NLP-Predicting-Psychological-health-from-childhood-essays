I am a short hand typist and I work in an office with two other ladys.
I live with my parants in southampton and somtimes we go out to tea at my brothers house.
My brother is married and I was his bridesmaid at his wedding.
I left school when I was about sixteen years old, and I went straight to a collage where they teach you short hand.
At first I did not get on very well, because I did not understand short hand, but after a I sorn picked it up. 
Before I left school I did a newspaper round and collected a little bit of money.
But now I have got quite a good job and am very good at short hand typing I get quite a lot of money.  Words: 128
