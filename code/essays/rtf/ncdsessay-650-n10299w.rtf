"""That'll do today, line up."" I am working at a school in Glasgow as a music teacher sometimes it is good but other times you nearly go mad....
Four o'clock all ready the time has gone in fast this afternoon, I will need to hurry home because my husband and I are expecting vistors.
The two friends are people I was at collage with, as usual we will likely talk about collage. 
It my spare time I sometimes go to the park for a walk, although alot of it has been cut off because of new flats, but I still enjoy it.
In the morning I still am an awful sleepy head, but not as much as I used to be.
In our house we have to try out a new burglar alarm to do with my husbands work. The thing I don't like about it is that his friends keep on popping to see if it works, and it makes an awful noise. Well I will need to hurry on now to get home in time so ""Good bye""."  Words: 176
