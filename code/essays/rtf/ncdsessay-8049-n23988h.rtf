I am working now as a chartered accountant. My work is to check the figures that go to the taxman. I have a good pay so I lead an enjoyable life at home. My home overlooks a park. I live alone in the house. but I have a dog. I take my dog out to the park regulerly. I take some interest in watching the home football team play. At night I usualy watch television. My house is a bungalow.  Words: 80
