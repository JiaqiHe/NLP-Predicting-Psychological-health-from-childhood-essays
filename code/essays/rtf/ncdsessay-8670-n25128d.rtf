"On my 25th birthday "" I went out on my first driving lesson, I never got on quite well, my first night but I soon got the hang of it . I had to past my driving test before I got this new job as a moter mecha*nec . A month passed and I sent away my applicaiton for my test , I was out practising every day because I did want this job very much , with a girlfreind to take out every night and I cant afford it. After two weeks I got a reply from the driving centre that I was to take my test in the 25th this the 21th so I got all ready . I gave the car a good wash . The 25th came it was 3'o'clock the time I had to take my test at. We went all over town, and when we came back he told I had passed my test. By this time It was 4'o'clock I rushed to the garage and told him I could start a soon as possible he told me to start on Monday so I started after that we got married with two children two boys and we lived happliy ever after ."
