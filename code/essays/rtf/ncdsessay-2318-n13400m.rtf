----------------------
I am leading a very happy life. I lvie in a farmhouse in the countryside.
I am married and have two children one girl and one boy, the boy is one and the girl is three. Lots of people in the city have lots of modern gadgets we have three, a cooker, a washing mach-ine, and a bed that folds up into the wall. Two days a week I work as a houskeeper in a little cottage nearby.
We have one sheep dog and one cat, I also have a horse of my own.
We live two miles away from the village. We have one car and one van. It is a fairly large farmhouse with five bedrooms.
All the cottages get their milk, butter and eggs from us.
I also take a few people for riding lessons. My daughter wants to learn to ride but I think it will be better if she waits about another 3years.
My husband of course is a farmer.  Words: 159
