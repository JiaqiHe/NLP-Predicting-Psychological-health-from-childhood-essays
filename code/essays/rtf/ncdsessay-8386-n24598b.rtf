I am a teacher at the age of 25. And live on my own. I am having quite a nice time being a teacher. The work is a littte hard but I dont care. I have a car (a mini) and like driving along to school. The class I have is second year junior. They are nearly all good workers. I like listening to the comedy films on T.V. On Saturday I have a lay in, then after breakfast I go shopping. All school days I am busy, some of the children want to know this, and some that and at dinner time the noise is defening. So I am glad to get home. At home it is quiet, but at school it is noisy, I would rather have someone else in the house with me. But at school I would rather have it quiet. In my spare time I enjoy dinner out.  Words: 153
