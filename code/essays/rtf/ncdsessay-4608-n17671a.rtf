I am 25 and I have quiet a few interests. These are my interests I like tennis and stamp collecting which I have been doing all my life, reading, dress making, knitting and cooking. I work in a bank and have quite a good salary and also holiday. and I still live with my mother and Father. My life is going on quiet steaddilly and some evenings I go to dances and enjoy myself. I make most of my dresses and knit most of my jumpers and cardigans****ch I enjoy doing very much. In the summer holidays I go on holidays sometimes abroad and sometimes in England. So I genrally have quiet a nice life. I am also in the tennis club and so I sometimes go to their dances and balls. 
At home at night I do not have to do much work at all infact it is not very often that I have to do work at home. Soon when I am a bit older I maybe getting married and so I am looking forward to that and when I am married I hope to have a family.
