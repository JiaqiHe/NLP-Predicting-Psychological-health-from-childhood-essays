I am 25 years old and I am a in the navy most of the time I am out to sea in a very modern ship with lots of other saliors with me. I am out in bad conditions in winter summer spring and Autom In summer the sea might very calm but in winter the sea is very rough and might break the ship. But still we have to sail in all kinds of wheather raining or Sunshine.

At 25 years of age I might be a footballer who plays Tottenham Hotspur or some other football team. In football it is much better than sailing in the rough sea's at winter. Football may be a bit rough when you get kicked very hard but it is still better than getting drowned in the rough sea at winter and no one spotted very soon or it may be day before somebody finds out. But in football you don't get killed or drowned by the rough waves.  Words: 165
