This is a story about my life at 25. I am married and am a housekeeper. I have a baby girl who is now 1 1/2 years. old. My intrests are sewing, knitting and reading. At the moment I am going out for a walk in the park, and this will give me an appitite for my lunch. We do not live far from the park and we have shops nearby to. On Saturdays we go to town and get the main shopping. Monday is the busiest day of the week when I have washing and ironing to do. Tomorrow it is my birthday and I am having a few friends. We have now reached the park and my daughter is running around. Next week we are going our holidays to France. We will stay in France for a fortnight. This holiday is a tour of France which will take us through most of the important cities. Now, it is 12 noon it is time we were getting home.
