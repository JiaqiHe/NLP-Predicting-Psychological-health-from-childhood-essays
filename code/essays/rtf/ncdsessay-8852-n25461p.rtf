I am now twenty five and a teacher at a Church of England school. Teaching infants is a very hard job. Everyday we have a reading lesson in the afternoon and in the morning another teacher takes them for bible lessons. At tea o'clock I take them again for arithmetic and I give them about ten sums a day, adding up, take away and multiplication sums, they quite enjoy themselves sometimes though I give them twenty seems to do. The afternoon is the easyest part of the day for me because for the first half hour the children read and then it's play and after play they either play games or do corrections only those who are good at arithmetic or reading can play games or do corrections only those who are good at arithmetic or reading can play games but they all have writing practice. I am not married and I live with a friend in a bungalow and every month we share the rent. My friend who is the same age is a nurse at a children's hospital in ****. Every day she gets a number two bus and it only takes five minutes. Sometimes we go to the cinema or to a club which is called **** it is very interesting and pases the time away. My friend and I take turns at cooking and we try to have a lot of vedgetables and potatoes. We both enjoy are life very much.  Words: 245
