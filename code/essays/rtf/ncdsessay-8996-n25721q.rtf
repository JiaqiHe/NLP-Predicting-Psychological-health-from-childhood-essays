----------------------
I have two chidren to look after both still babies. My husband goes out to work and when he comes home his expects his dinner to be ready for him. The babies make a lot of work for me because they are always throwing their toys round the house. Also once every day I have to take them for a bit of fresh air round the park. They both while I ame in a Shop buying food and things like that cry their eyes out. I also have to look after and feed a dog who eats a lot of food. I have to buy a pound of meats to boil for him every day Also I go out for a change with a friend, and leave my husband to look after the children. I like to play tennis, and I like rowing on a pond with a friend. I oftern go out to parties and to dances. Sometimes the next door neighbour looks after the two babies while I and my husband go to the cinema, and sometimes go out to See friends.  Words: 184
