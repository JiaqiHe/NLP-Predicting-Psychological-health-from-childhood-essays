I am 25 years old I am a Head-mistress of an Infant school. I enjoy this because I like small children.
I live in a mechun size house I have two children they are both girls and they are both four. I do a lot of needle work and I make dresses for my children and I. 
My Intrests are horse riding and needle work, cooking and modeling pots.
At my school problems are always making themselves up wheels come of toy prams and of bysicles, the first aid kit runs out I think the school must have payed a fortune on bandages and things. When I get home I am welcomed by my children and my husband's snore because he goes on night duty as a police man he also has a alsation dog which does work for the police (we keep it at home much to the delight of the children.)
But being 25 is a big responsibility I have to get the children up get their tea without the help of my husband I have to keep the dog quitein case he waches my husband up and all number of things.  Words: 191
