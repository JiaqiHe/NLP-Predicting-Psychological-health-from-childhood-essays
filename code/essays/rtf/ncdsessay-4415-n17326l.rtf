When I am 25 years old I might be married and I might be a spinster. If I do get married I would like two children. I would like a girl and a boy. I would have a nice big house in the country. Rather like a farm. With cows, pigs, horses, and chickens. The kind of man I would like should be tall, kind, sensible and generous. If he wore a beard, a moustache, or a beaver I wouldn't marry him. If a man had a beard I wouldn't marry him for all the tea in China. Sometimes people lead a hard and hatred life while others lead a pleasant and happy life. If you married a poor man your might not have a happy life at all. It would be the same for a family with too much money. I would like not to be poor and not be too rich. Most people have a pleasant life. I wish that I can be a good helpful housewife. If I don't get married I will propabilly work in my dads shop and let my mother go home to do the housework. Also to make the dinner for us.  Words: 199
