I have just left the Royal Air Force. I live by a small lake in the lake district. I have a small sailing boat and I am a geoligest. I mine for copper up on the fells above the lake. I am a keen fisher man althogh I do not fish for a living. There are sevaral large islands by the vilage on the far side of the lake. I am very intrested in boats of all kinds but I like Sailing boats best. I am not very interested in rugby, football and cricket. I am interested in antiques and I have a few antiques hung on the walls or stood on shelfs of mantle pieces. I like animals and I like horse's and dogs epsepcionaly although I keep nither. I am interested in heraldry and above the door to the pigion loft is a coat of arms. My motto is have faith in the faithful which when translated into latin is fidelas estote fidelabus. I have a small two seater sports car which is rather old fashond. I keep two homing pigions one called Homer and the other Roland.  Words: 190
