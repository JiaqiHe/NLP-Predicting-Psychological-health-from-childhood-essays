I am now 25 years old, I work as an architect. I go to clubs at night, and come home at 10 o'clock, I live by myself, in a small cottage in Essex. I enjoy myself a lot, and I do a lot of painting or drawing. I have a car, that I go to work in. On Thursdays I play in a pop group in a night club. I like my work, and I get payed well. My cottage is white-washed outside, it has a kitchen 1 bedroom and a lounge. I am a tall dark man with freckles on my nose. I have plenty of friends, and I visit them often. My best friend lives in Susex. He works in my office, so he has a long way to travel to work in a morning. I like to go sailing my yatch, it is a large vessel and it cost over xxxx3,000. I also build ships and the sell them. I once disined a block of flats and some houses.  Words: 172
