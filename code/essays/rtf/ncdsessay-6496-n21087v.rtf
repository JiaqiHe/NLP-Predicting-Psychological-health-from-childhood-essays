I am now 25 years old and I work in an office. I live in Hull and am married with a little girl. I go to Work from 9am till 4 oclock. I have a lady who comes in to look after my little girl. I go to work five days a week Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and Friday I have Saturday off to do my house work. The thing I like doing best is cooking and Sewing. I make a lot of dresses. My husband works in Hull at a garage. We have a car and we sometimes go out at night. When we go on holiday I would like to go to Wales.  Words: 115
