I am married, I am still doing a lot of reading, but not as much as I used to, as when I was eleven. I like cooking, and go to night school every Monday, for art and pottery. I have a part-time job, as a secretary in an office. On Sundays, I go to church. We have a television, but I do not often have it on. Sometimes I go and visit my Mum and Dad, and take them out. In the evenings, or when I have spare time, I either do some needlework, or play the piano. I get up at about 7.15 in the morning. I have my breakfast, and go to work at 9.30. I come back at 11.45, and get dinner. After dinner, I either go and visit my Mum, or go to my sisters. house. Then I come home, and have tea about 18.00. Until 23.00, I do ironing or play the piano. Sometimes I bring home clay from nightschool, and make pots, or do some drawing. I like drawing horses.  Words: 176
