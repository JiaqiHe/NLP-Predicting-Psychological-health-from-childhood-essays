On a Saturdays I would like to go to the [club] and get all thier Autographs. Then I would go home make the tea for all of us. Then I'd take the boys or girls or both for a walk and by them some shoe's. if thiers have worn through. I'd get all my shopping done with my husband. We would by some sweets for the kids or kid.
We would get the bus and go home and make the Supper and put the kids to bed and then I'd setle down.
Later I put the lights out and went to sleep. The next day* I got up and made the breakfast, and called the kids and my husband to get up and get thier breakfast down them Then the kids could go out and play and have a good time the I'd call them in for dinner and then let the food settle and then they can go out and play again We would go out and see thier Aunty and my husband and I would talk and the kids might play We would go whenever we could, mosty on a Sunday. We would always go at 5. o. clock. after we got home I made the tea, and then we would either watch television or go out to play and have a good play.  Words: 224
