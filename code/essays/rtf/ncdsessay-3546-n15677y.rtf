When I get to 25 years old and I have left school I shall have a big house with all posh garages to put my car in. My window shall be all painted white and it will be a big bay window Inside the house I shall have gold curtains that will go with the window and it will look nice. In my garden I shall have a lawn that is covered with flowers all round the edges and they will be roses, daffodils and tulips. In the garden there shall be a swimming pool that shall have hot water in so that I can lay about all day long with the sun glaring in my eyes. On a Wednesday I would like to go to a collage were they have short hand writing and it would not take me long to write a letter to anybody. My car shall be a write long white one which has space in the back where people can sleep. In the back there will be some camping beds and there I should have curtains up at the back so that people could not come and look at you while you was asleep and pinch anything While I was at home I would be eating lovely juicy belly pork and sweets like qualty steets. wouldn't it be lovely.
