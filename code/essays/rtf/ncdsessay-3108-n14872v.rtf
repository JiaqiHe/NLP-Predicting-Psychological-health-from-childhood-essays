My intrests are quite plain my favorite thing which I like to do is looking after and selling Budgies. The only time when I can sell budgies is when I come home from collage I am trainng to be a nurse. I have digs with one of my collage friend who is also training to be a nurse. At weekends I go home to see my parents. On Tuesday evenings I go out, mostly to concerts I very rarly go out to the cinema.
      I set off for collage at about 8 o'clock The day starts by changing in to a nurses uniform then we go round the wards of a training hospital with trained nurses. We read. the temperature chart and take the patents temerature and pulse. The trained nurse tells us where we go wrong and tells us how to do it right. At twelve o'clock we stop for dinner we have an hour off. In the after noon we go into a class room to learn more about nursing at five o'clock we go home that realy is all we do in the day
      Some nights I go out with friends but most nights are spent reading books. My parents help to pay my rent as I dont get much money for my self.
      It is a long journey home to [town] from [city] at weekends and the ten o'clock train from [city] is most Saturday's crowded. When I get home. I sometimes go out for a walk in the hills with my father and Mother. 
      That really is about all I do now adays. It is quite a hard life but I enjoy it.  Words: 279
