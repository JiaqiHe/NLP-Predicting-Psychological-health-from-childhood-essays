In the mornings I do my housework, and then I go out to the stables I own, and see that everything is running smoothly. I exercise some of the horses and take oout rides tell 12. o'clock. Then I go to my house and make the lunch. I have sevral employies. In the afternoon I help my employery seetle the ponies down for the night. 
Father on in the afternoon I do my shopping. Then I retire to my house for the evening and perphaps do some knitting or have some friends over for dinner.
In my spare time I usualy go to a hunt or gmkana, but I enjoy my work and am usualy to be found down at my stables.
My main intreast is Horses and Ponies but I do like knitting, swimming and cycling even though I am hopeless at it.  Words: 142
