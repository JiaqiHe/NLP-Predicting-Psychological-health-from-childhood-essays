I am notw* 25 and have a job as a engineer. I have a normal size house. I enjoy being an engineer it has a lot of exciting things to do. I enjoy motoring at weekends, and I also enjoy gardening and I have a middle size garden. I am known quite well known by every one in our firm. I am going to be made head engineer soon which is quite a step up for me.  do a lot of do-it- yourseld at home I make cupboards, shelves, and I even madea tabe once I live on my own at the moment but but hope to get married in about 2 years. In my job I get very busy, I have to travel a long way sometimes, to do big jobs. I been at our firm 4 years nearly and it hasn't taken me long to settle down in my job. Before I came to my job I had spent 2 years in a engineering college to learn all about the job I was going to do. 2 years didn't seem long but I had to make sure I learnt a lot. I took up engineering because I thought it was an active job and would keep me busy. 
     Being able to do do-it-yourself saves me money. About a quarter of the furniture in my house is made by me. So I have probably saved about xxxx100 in furniture expenses. I have made my house look quite modern especially in the launge where a lot of thing are made by me. I am quite good at cookingthrough being on my own and having to cook my own meals. I am always very busy nowadays.  Words: 286
