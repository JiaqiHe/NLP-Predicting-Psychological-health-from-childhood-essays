"I am now 25 and living in my mothers house. I have a job. I am a secretary. I went in for this job when I was 18 1/2 because I stayed on at school till I was 18 I needed all the knoledge I could get. If I was gointo work with a type writter printing away and writting letters. my life is being a happy one so far. I like my job and are getting a good wage. Sometimes I get a bit bored when the managers out because I'm on my own. He leaves me plenty of work to do, but the only noise is the rustle of letters forms and coppys plus the ""dit dit di di"" of the type writter I sometimes wonder if the walls are soundproof. When I'am at home in the evening I help with the house work that hasent been done during the day because mums out at work. Then comes the dirty dishes from breakfast time because mum and I start work the same time and finish the same time were home at 8 o'clock so mum leaves dads dinner in the oven and then when we get home we wash them together. Well that all I know about my daily chores."  Words: 212
