"The work I do is a hairdresser. I style ladies hair. I am not married and have no children. My intrests are reading, cooking and swimming. I haven't a boyfriend as I'm not very keen on boys. They are two noisy in my opinion. If I did get married, I would like to have two children, a boy and a girl. I would like a house in the country of my own and on my own just with a few pets such as a few cats, a dog and a parrot to talk to. I would be very happy just with my pets and a maid or two. I would call my cats, Riki Sooty and Topper, my dog, Nikki and my parrot Jakko. My dog would be a Miniture Jack Russel. I would like a garden with trees and allkinds of flowers. My house would be an old one, were my ancestors lived many years before me. I would love a shop of my own and I would call it the ""Hair Salon."" I hope I would have many costermers and pictures with hairstyles and cosmetics, that I and my custermers would use."  Words: 194
