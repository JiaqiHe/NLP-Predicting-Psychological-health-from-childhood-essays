When I am twenty five I would like to become a footballer but that is just a thought. The job that I would like to work is being an engeineer. I would like to be an engineer who goes round the world doing jobs. My hobby, I think, would be swimming I would try to buy a house at the Lake District. I think I wouldn't get married because then* I could roam about anywhere I like. I would try to buy a car. My intrest in life would be reading. The books that I read now are exciting adventure books but as I grow up I might change. I would buy a pet, which would be a dog to keep me company. I would by a labrador because I think they are a very inteligent dog. I don't know if I would visit my my mother reguraly. My mother alway says I will just leave her and forget about her but I don't think I will. My father works at the British Railways and I have a brother. I think a will visit him often. I will train my dog to do a lot of tricks. I will even take it to trainging classes. The most important thing that I want* to learn it is to stop and sit when I want it to. I would like to live to good age too.  Words: 234
