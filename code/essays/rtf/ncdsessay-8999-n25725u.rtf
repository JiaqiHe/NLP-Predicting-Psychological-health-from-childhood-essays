My life at twenty five years old.
I am not yet married but I still go out with a boy-friend of twenty seven years of age his name is [male name]. I work a part time job at an old peoples home I quite enjoy it.
I still live with my parents at a place called [town], and now that my mother and fatehr are geting old I have to do most of the house work. In the evenings I am able to go out with [male name], and I am sure that he is planning to get me an engagement ring for my birthday.
Well this routeen goes on all week exept for a Sunday I am able to go the church becuse me parents are very religous so [male name] takes them and I to church. 
Now I will tell you about what I do at work. I have all different shifts some times I have to work four to eight pm and some times I have to work nine untill twelve Am.  Words: 172
