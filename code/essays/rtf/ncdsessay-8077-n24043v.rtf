When I am twenty-five I would like to go alit to sea on a sein-net boat or be a ship builder and make hand-*i*e boats. I would like to live in a bungalo. Id make make modal boats in my spare time when Im not at sea or not doing anything important. When I have worked up enough money for myself Id by a boat for myself and work up money again to pay the crew. also Id' by a car for if I had to travel far. Sometimes I **** take the boat *** (place) or (place) if the fishing was not good.  Words: 104
