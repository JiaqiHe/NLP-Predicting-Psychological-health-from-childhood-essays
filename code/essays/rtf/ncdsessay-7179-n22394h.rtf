If I was't marryed and had a job. I would hope to be a leading a good career. If I lived* in a flat I mait find the the housework a bit difficult, becuase I would have to get up, get the breakfast, get washed and dressed, than go out to work. I would come back at night and properly be tied after the day work, but of couse I wouldn't have finished, for I would have the housework to do. If I was marryed my husband and I would both go out to work. If by any change we had a child my husband would go out to work and leave to do the housework and look after the child. My interests would be something to do with my job anything I did in my spare time. If I had a child my time would be spent with her or him, till she or he went to school. If my child did go to school, I would get my old job back and the child would stay school dinners. Of course if I had another child I wouldn't get my old job back, but I would work part-time.
