I am now twenty five. Every day I would like to be able to go out to an office and work as a secretery erning about sixteen pound a week or moor. At home I would like to have a large garden with fruit trees at the bottom and then about half way up I would like to have a vegetable crop, a huge lawn to play tennis and other different games. A nice big green house to grow miniture trees and then just in-front of the house and at the back I would like a flower bed. In side the house I would like to dacorate the kitchen blue and white with cupboards all the way round. In the living room I would like to keep a budgey and decorate the room yellow with a drop down leaf table and furniture to match. I would like to marry a man with a good job and play tennis with him in his spare time. I would very much like to learn to drive and then drive around just for fun. I would like as well to hold big tuperware parties for all my friends and relaytions and have my cupboards filled up with tuperware containers. But as well as keeping a budgey in the house I would like to look after some in an outdoor cadge.  Words: 226
