I am a doctor in a research centre for studying diseases. I am married to another doctor who works with me and I have no children though I would like a little girl or twins. We have a large house in the country with stables and I ade with the local hunt when I have time. We also have a flat in London near where we work. A cleaner comes to the flat regulally. I still love reading books by such authors as Walter Scott, Charles Dickens and Jane Austen and occasionally Georgette Heyer and Barbara Cartland. I love travelling abroad and also at home where I have a Portia and my husband a Jaguar and Ford Capri. I have quite a large collection of antiques which I enjoy looking for. We quite often go for a long weekend to Scotland usually to [village] a lovely little village close to [town] in [town]. [village] has lovely scenery all round it though it hasn't got very good bathing beaches and we also go on treks across the country. we also go into Wales for holidays round Swansea and [village] which have lovely beaches and small villages.
