I am 25 years old, and I am working as an electronic engineer. I still live at ****. I am engaged to a very pretey ladey with blond hair. For my 21st birthday I got a stereo-gramm*. When I have time off I usualy go to the cinema or make a home made radio, or record player.
In the year 1983 we have completley done away with the value* and radios are geting smaller and smaller. In 1969 moving picture cameres and screens cost about 76 pounds, nowdayes theys cost 10 pounds 17 shilings. 
I think everyone finds decimal carancey much easiar and that includes me. Just for my interests I am lurning to fly an airoplane.  Words: 116
