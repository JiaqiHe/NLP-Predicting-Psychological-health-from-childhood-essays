My name is **** my age 25. I have a wife and two children and work at **** in ****. My wage is twenty four pounds a week. I put two pounds in the bank and give five pounds ten to the wife for house keeping and if she needs more she gets the extra as well. My interests are to save enough money up to buy a big house in the country and to have a stables and four horses to go riding in my spare time. I have a very happy life and I allways make sure my wife is happy. The house I live in now is warm but there is a large main road directly in front and when the children get a little older they might get themselves run over by dashing into the road. We are going to London this year for two weeks on a holiday camp right next to the river *ee. and perhaps have a ride in one of the small rowing boats that are for hire there we won't be staying in a caravan though there are some on the camp we will stay in a shally. the children will be able to play on the swings and slide like they do at home. You see of love my children and my wife.  Words: 223
