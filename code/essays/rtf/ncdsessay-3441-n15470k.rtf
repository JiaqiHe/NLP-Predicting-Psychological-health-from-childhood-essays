I live in an old mansion near where I work. I am a scientist and study the life of small insects. Belonging to a football club I play every Sunday. At home I like gardening and having parties. It a happy life for me I think. Being a scientist is a very hard job and you don't get paid much either. I enjoy sport and games my best are football and cricket. At home I enjoy quieter thing like playing chess with a friend. My house is shared with some of my friends.  Words: 93
