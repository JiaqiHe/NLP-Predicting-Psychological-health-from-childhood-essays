My work is a tireing job and very hard I work for a football team named Leeds United I play goalkeeper. I have a semi detached house with a wife and two children we live near Adel and we do never have lodgers. Our children are both four years of age. I go for a quite game of golf nearly every Sunday. The only time I don't have a game of golf is where the weather is bad or the team is at another country. As my job as a footbaler is very hard, I am a part time plane instructer and I often go glyding if the weather permits in the week. At nights I paint pictures of famouse planes and I sell them, my children often scripple drawings on bits of paper. My Wife works at a factory witch make cotton into wool. I write an artical in the paper every week about the life of a footballer.I often thing of my scholl days and playing goal for [school name] when I was ten and how our team lost every match except two. I also hoped when I was young to play goal for Leeds I thought it would never come true but it did. 
My wife is a keen reader of books and gets worried easily. My home life is not so tireing as my work we often talk about our children an what they will grow up to be and how they will get on at school when they are older. And how we got on to day and what we did and what things happened which were strange.  Words: 273
