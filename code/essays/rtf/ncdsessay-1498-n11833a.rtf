I am a dress desiner with a few other girls an dI live with my mum and dad at the house where I have lived since I was six. I love my job because when I was younger I liked sewing and makeing things for the dolls which I had. Every Firiday I go to [community centre] to teach tap dancing. I give all my wages to my mum who pays for the clothes I get. I hardly ever buy clothes I mostly make them on my very complicated sewing machine. I go to work every day to be there at half past ten. I do not work. In my bedroom I still have the small blue teddybear which I made in Mrs [name]s class at [school]. I made it with a student. On Saturday I finish work a bit earlier than usual to do some shoping. On Saturday night I go to the pictures with my friend [name] with a few boys and a few more girls.  Words: 168
