My name is [female name] [surname] and I am going to tell you my story. I am 25 years old and I have just finished work. It is a very nice job and my wages are good. I am a nurse and I look after everyone who has been run over by cars, byses, and everything I still have my husband to look after and I have a lot of casultis to deal with. My parents are still alive and I visit them every week. I like children and all animals. My favorite animal is a dog. I have to do a lot of work at home and I am never hadley their to do it. My life is very hard being a nurse because there is hardly no time for me at home I am always at work. I work in the day and not at nights because I have a husbnad to look after. I am interested in wether they are going to put man on the moon and when and I like watching films on it when I get the time. When I go shopping I meet lots of interesting people and we always talk about what we did at work. My parants are good to me and when someone is away from work in my ward of a night she always has* my husband in to sleep. Of evening my husband nows that I am tierd so he always makes me a cup of tea and tells me to lie down and to have a rest because I am tierd. Well I have told you and that is all I can think of.
