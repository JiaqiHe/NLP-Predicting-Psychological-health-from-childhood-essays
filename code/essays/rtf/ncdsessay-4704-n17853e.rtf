"I will have to get [name] up first and get him off to day nursery. Right! thats him off to school and I am waiting for the bus to come to take me off to the hospital where I am working part time. I have done all the housework and when I get back I will have to cook dinner after dinner when I have washed the dishes we are going to a show called ""The Mikado"" which we have all been looking forward to. Right now I have to deal with a caualtie case a little boy poured some hot water* into a cup to make a drink for himself but the handle of the saucepan was too hot for him and he tipped it over his chest a neighbour heard him scream because his mother was out at work, and rang for an ambulance. Here is the ambulance now. I had better get a nurse to get a bed ready for him. Ah! there goes the first stroke of four and time I went home to collect [name] and get the dinner on."  Words: 185
