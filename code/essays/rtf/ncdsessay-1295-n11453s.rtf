Now that I am 25 I will get a job as a policeman or a bus driver. I have a wife and two children, if I dont get to be a policeman or bus driver I will go and work at [steelworks]. I will try and get to the engerneering department, I will live a a lovely live and look after my children well. I will give them as much care as I were given and I will treat them like I were. I will give them all the help that I can. I will still go on swimming and collecting stamps one day I want to swim against other swimmers of my own age. One day I will try and swim across the channel to France, and I will try and get alot more bedges for swimming. If I get the job at [steelworks] I will try to be very good at my job and help all the younger ones in doing their work. I will try a make the house that I will live in to my families approval. I will plant alot of roses in my garden and try and make it look very nice and neat. I will buy a house that has a woods at the back of it and some lovely high trees where my children can play. I have a plum, apple a pear tree in my garden but are very small and do not have any fruit on them.  Words: 247
