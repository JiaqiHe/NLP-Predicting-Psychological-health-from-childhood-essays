Twenty Five years of age.
I lead a good life, and I live with my mother and father still. I am a private secatery and I work in london and earn eleven and sixpence an hour, I enjoy work very much. I have my own interests that I do in my spare time encuding Art, Dancing, Dressmaking and reading. Also in spare time I help my mother as muck as I can. I go to work at eight o clock and come home at five o clock. Sometimes I go out in the evenings but, as I do a very tiering job I need the sleep. We live in a three bedroom council house, and I have a bedroom of my own. I have some of my own possesions which I look after very carefuly, such as my taperecorder, transister and my car which is a red mini. I make all my mothers clothes for her and always do her hair as I love doing hair - dressing. My paintings are all genuin, and I am hoping to sell some. Dancing has always been my favourite interest and I have always hoped to be a good dancer but in away I have been unlucky because I haven't ever had a boy partner who has stayed dancing with me so I can get on well, but it is not much use geting disapionted because I have still got a chance really a better chance than I had while I was younger. I will be visiting Australia with my parent next month and I am looking forward to it very much.  Words: 268
