"Now I am 25 I lead a pleasant life with my husband and baby daughter Gail. I work as a reporter to a newspaper called ""The Morning Glory"". I am interested in continental dishes and making things. I finish work next week as I will have a baby which, with a bit of lick, will be a boy. We will call him [male name] after his father. I didn't mind giving up my job, as [male name] is a builder and he gets a good wage I was due for a rise in a month but it doesn't matter now. We shall live in a new house in Surrey with four bedrooms and a bathroom a lounge a kitchen and a nursery for the children."  Words: 125
