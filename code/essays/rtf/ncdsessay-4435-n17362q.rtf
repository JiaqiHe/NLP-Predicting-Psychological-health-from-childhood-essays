If I was 25 I think I will still be in collage. At night time I will go out with my boyfriend to the cinima. I will still be carruing my Piano lessons on. apart from playing a few other instruments. The collage I will be going to will be the Art collage. In my spare time I will visit my mum and Dad. I will go out fairly often to. I don't think I will gat married untill I am 30 years old. Other days when I have time of I will go out to town and buy clothes. Not very often though. In the evenings I would go out to a club and enjoy myself. I would get home at about half past 11 then go to bed. When I woke up in the morning I would change and go to the collage in my car. My car will be a sports car. which will be red.
At the weekends I will go home and see my parents. Some evening I will play the piano at home and practise my scales and pieces. When I leave collage I will go and get a good job. I will enjoy life as much as I can. When I get a good job I will live in a small flat and go out to town on saturdays. Sometimes I will buy some new shoes or a dress or coat. I will buy good food too. Later I will get married to a handsome man with dark hair and brown eyes. I won't wear much make up only a bit of eye shadow and powder. I will always try and be modern.
