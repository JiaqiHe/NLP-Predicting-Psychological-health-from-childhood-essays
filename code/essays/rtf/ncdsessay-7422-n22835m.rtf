----------------------
I live on my own in a small flat. I have a job as a private secrutary in a large dirty grey block of offices. At home I practise typing on an electric typewriter in my spare time I am getting married in the following June. Also I help run the youth club on a friday night with a young couple who live in the flat opposite me. I am very lucky at being able to be a private secrutary at my age but as I was reasonably good at English and am a fast typer he took me on. I get a good wage packet and I have plenty to pay my rent. I am also saving up for my wedding and for when we start a family we have already bought our house as the wedding is only two months ahead. It is a 3 bedroomed house on a new estate just south of London, a mile away from where I work. We hope to have a boy and 2 girls but we'll just have to wait and see.  Words: 181
