----------------------
I live in a house just outside the town. I have a dog called Jip which I take for walks early in the morning and late at night I also teach at a school in the town. The class I take is an infant class. Everyday we do little sums and the after that we play games in the playground if its nice. Then we have the first break. When they come back in, I give them some books with pictures and patterns in for them to copy nad by the time they have finished, it is time for dinner
When they come back in after dinner I give them easy jigsaws and plasticine and painting things to play with and then when it is all cleared up they go out to play. When they come back in and they are all sitting down I read a story then when it is finished they go home.
When I get home I am greeted by my dog and then I give him a little walk and them we come back home and have our dinner. After dinner I usually get a book to read or I draw or paint. I like reading very much and I often go to the library in town and spend a few hours looking for the right book. I am also very fond of painting and I have painted one picture which I am going to have framed. 
I am very good at sewing although I don't go to needle work classes and I have made myself 2 dresses a skirt and 3 blouses.
Altogether I like the life I lead very much.  Words: 274
