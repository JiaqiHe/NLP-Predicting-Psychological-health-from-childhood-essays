AT the age of 25 I would be maried but still be going to work we would go out. And go to see my brothers, go to the pictures often keep the house nice and clean. If I had any children I would keep them nice and clean, feed them with the right food and take them the doctors after every six months so they would not get any decsease at all. Keep my hus band working and try not to let him drink, Beer or any alcaolicks. Not to smoke to much keep myself nice and clean too. Have one pet a dog or a cat that will not get dirty all the time, Have vistiors to tea, visit my parent s very often. By my children new clothes put them to bed early so they will get refreshed for the morning. Send them to shcool, Go on holaday every year by the children toys to play with. Try to by a car to go out in. I wont leave the children in by them selfes if I go out try to get a baby sitter, if not I would stay in with them. Let them play with lots of children and try to make frieds with them. I hope to have a happy life with out having any arguments or fighting. Not to let the children eat things they should not, like buttons or beads. Let my hus band lead a happy life  Words: 245
