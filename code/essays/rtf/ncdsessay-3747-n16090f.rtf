When I am 25 years old I will be living in Australia, where I hope to have a sheep farm. I would like to have a horse and a dog to round up the sheep and I will have to get some more people to help me. I live in New South Wales on a ranch with my friend and a lot of workers. Often we have to kill the Dingo Dogs because they harm the sheep. Every year we have to get all the wool off the sheep, sometimes we have quite a job to keep the silly sheep still. At Christmas we usually go to a quiet beach where we have our Christmas dinner. It is always summer time in Australia at Christmas. If I get married and have children they will have to have their lessons off a radio because we live a long way from the nearest school. There are quite a few strang animals in Australia like the Duck billed Platipipuss which has feet like a ducks and a bill like a duck, but they have got fur. When we go on picnics we often see kangaroos and koala Bears, lots of the kangaroos are about 6ft high. But When they baby kangaroos who are called joeys are born they are very small. The koala Bears are little cuddy bears who feed on the eclipatuss leaves. They are very sweet and are nice to look at.  Words: 241
