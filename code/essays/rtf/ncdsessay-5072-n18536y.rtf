I am twenty-five and my job is a motor mechanic. I work in a garage and I earn xxxx19.18.0 a week. I have no family and I live with my friend who is a carpenter and earns xxxx21.7.6. I and my friend hope to buy an E type jaguar each.
My hobbies are television, horse-riding, football, cricket, and my favourite swimming. We share an aparment with a toilet and bathroom, kitchen, two bedrooms a hall and a sitting-room.
We both start work at 9 am and finish at 7 pm we have one hour for dinner and we each take it in turns to cook the meal. We work six days a week on Sunday we go swiming if it is fine, otherwise we stay in and watch television or else play cards such as crib, pontoon, rummy and whist. At night we go and visit our mothers together. Sometimes we go for a drink but not very often as we are not heavy drinkers. Occasionally we would go to an opera or go to the pictures or for a nice long walk in the country to look at the scenery and the flowers blooming in spring.
There is one thing which we don't like and that is young children speeding around and and motor bikes as these are death traps. When I was young I was not allowed one and besides, I have never liked them.
In the evenings, after work we sit in arm-chairs and put up our feet to relax and watch television. Sometimes friends call, but we don't go about in larg crowds.  Words: 263
