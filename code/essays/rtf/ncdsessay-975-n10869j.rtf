----------------------
I would like be a model but if I can not be a model I would like to be a teacher. I do not want to be married. It is a very busy life becauseyou do not know when there is to be a fashion show or a phographic session. It is very hard work as a model as you may have to stand up all day and you have to be careful what you eat. I would like to live in a small flat. not to high, in (place) If I am not working I will want to have friends round to the flat and go out with friends. I will have clothes that are in fashion. I will try to buy something new at least once a month. Models work long hours and don't get a very high pay . at home I want to share a flat with a friend (pref***able with another model) we will take it in turns one week one makes meals while the other does the housework then we will change round. We make coffee whenever we need it and both was the dishes. (the one on house-work goes to the launderette) I hope this idea will work.
If I can not be a model I would like to be a teacher. The flat, the same idea ecxept in (place) or about there, I would like to teach 3* year juniors. I like children so would like to teach . I am not sure if I'll be married or not, but I think I will. I would like to play the piano in my spare time as well as driving about different places. I would like to do this is my spare time if I am a model as well. I will not where much make-up as it is not good for your skin.  Words: 310
