I am a teacher at [school name] Primary School. I like being a teacher very much. It is an interesting life and I teach little infants who have just started school at five years of age and teach them till they are seven years old. My name is Mrs [surname] and I started teaching two years ago. In my spare time I have other hobbies as well as knitting and sewing. In my spare time I go ski-ing and ice skating. I have three children, all girls. They are triplets and are exactly alike. They have black glossy hair which is in wringlets. Their names are [female name], [female name] and [female name]. They like winter sports as well as I do and they hope to be proffessionals. They attend [school name] Primary School. One has Mr [surname] and the other two have Mr. [surname]. My life is happy and if the holidays get too long I get a little bored. I hope my children grow up to be teachers the same a me. They are twelve years of age and have not long to go till they are eighteen.  Words: 190
