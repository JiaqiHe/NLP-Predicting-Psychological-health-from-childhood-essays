If I was 25 I would want to work in my daddy's work to do type wrighting because I have had a practise on one. I would want four children two girls two boys. so I would work till five o'clock. But when I would be of work I would do the work and look after the children. When it would be the summer holidays first I would take them where I had been then I would tkae them on a eiroplane to another place. But if we had an animal I would have on which somebody could look hafter or an animal which we could take with us. I would like to live in a bungerlow with a big lawn round it. But I would still like to live in [town] so I can get to my daddy's work where I want to go. I would want a car and a garage at the side of the bungerlow. I like horses but perhaps I wouldn't have one. In children I would like boy then girl boy then girl. I would like to go and visit people and send letters to people to friends. I will help my children in work and to ** play them with each other nicely and to let them help each other in there work. I would help the girls to cook and help other people to do things. So the people will be kind to them.  Words: 242
