I am working at [company name] Lifts in the assembley dept. and at the moment I'm working on a goods lift I can not tell you of all the bits but there are quite alot though business has been slack its the second lift I have done. Since March 18 I have only had one order and this is what I am doing. For my hobbys or interestes I am very intrested in railways but I had better not say any thing about it because once I get started it is hard for me to stop. Life at home has been a bit boring nothing much to do so I have been mucking about with odds and ends and sometimes doing a bit of train spotting. My house is large and over looks on to the railway and the valley but in summer I can't sit back and enjoy the view I have to mow the lawn which is quite a tiresome job because the area of 16 sq feet so its along job. and then when I have to dig the garden its a longer job still and so in summer there is not much rest as I said. I find one snag with liveing here the wind when it comes wooshes round the house and makes it shudde when there is a gale on you nearly get carried round the whole house and if you hold a table-cloth out it goes flat like a plank of wood and is nearly whisked out of your hand, probbaly if the wind blew hard enough it might blow the house down and that would be a do no where to live. I have a large railway but I don't run it very often it is mainley at a stand still.  Words: 299
