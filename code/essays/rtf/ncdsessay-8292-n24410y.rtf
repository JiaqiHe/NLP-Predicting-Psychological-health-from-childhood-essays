Now that I am 25 I have a family of three. I work as a pilot on a large jet. This job is interesting as one is able to see wonderful cities all over the world. Spain, France, Japan Germany and many other places. When I am at home I enjoy playing golf, tennis, cricket with my older son, and also fishing. At home there are plenty of jobs to do Fixing loose handles on doors, mending the draw that has always got stuck (untill I mended it)! Painting the house. My wife says that by the time I have finished painting the whole house it will be time to paint the first parts of the house that I painted again. I love being at home, to be able to relax in front of the cosy fire, read the newspaper and smoke my old pipe. I do not often enjoy home comforts as I am away flying the jet airliner My wife sometimes mones at me for being away for so  many weeks. I tell her that nothing would make me change my job.
