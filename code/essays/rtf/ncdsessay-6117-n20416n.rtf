"I am a married girl I go out to work teaching. When I got home my feet were killing me, and I saw my husband sitting on the sofa. I said to him, ""It's alright for you. You don't have to go to work and stand up every now and then like I do.""
""Oh shut up woman your always moaning "". He said
I lead quite a good life sometimes. Next day my husband and I went into the woods. We went to pick some blackberries. I was interested in picking blackberries, swimming, sports, television and lots of other things. My life is dad with a man called [male name] next door to us. When I don't go to work my home life is playing records and I work at my own doing my housework. Sometimes I have a friend next door but one to us and she comes and helps me with my work. If I have a problem all I ahve to do is to go round to her house and tell her I am in difficulties. I was not feeling too good yesterday because I was having a bit of trouble with expensis and debts. The work in our house was too hard to cope with because as soon as I tidied the place up they messed it up again."  Words: 222
