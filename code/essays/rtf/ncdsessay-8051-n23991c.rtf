"It all began when [name] and I went to watch a football match. It wasnt a sort of vital game but [name] and myself thought that we would like to go and have a look, it was beetween [football club] and [football club], 20 minutes had gone then the [football club] full-back got a hard knock on the head and had to be taken off, on came the subsituite all full of beans and ready to go then a couple of minutes later another [football club] man injured no more subsitutes so over the loud speaker ""Any Voulanteers to play till the end of the match for [football club], any voulanteers for [football club]"" Then [name] said ""Why don't you go"", I repieled ""Well if your so clever why dont you voulanteer"", again he repieled ""Because I want you to go"". ""Okay I give in"" I said ""but whier have you got to go"" 1 man behind us said ""Right down their sonny, go and ask the trainer to give you a top and go and tell the referee your name and you'll playing before you Jack Robinson"", I was soon playing with number 10 on my back, when the game was over it ended in a draw 2-2. but the manager told me I could play for the club regular."
