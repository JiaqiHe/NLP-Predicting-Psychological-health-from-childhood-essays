----------------------
I am now 25. I am a music teacher. I have two sisters and one Brother. I am very happy with my work. It is fairly easy but sometimes harder. I am very happy at home and enjoy cooking my meals at home. I enjoy sitting playing the piano to keep me ocupied. I do not go to the cinema or theatre very much. My ambition is to Be a pianist in an orchestra or a wind instrement player. I have passed all my grades and are taking my a and o levels in music. I have 40 pupils a week for piano lessons mostly girls. I charge 5/6 for half an hour.

My ownly free days are Wednesday, Saturday sometimes, Sunday and Tuesday. I have my own room for piano lessons. I have been teaching since I was 19 nearly 20. With the money I earn I buy myself music books and the rest is used for going to concerts ect......

When I am older about 29 to 30 I will stop teaching music and go to more concerts and in my spare time I would practise playing the piano and my wood wind instement.  Words: 194
