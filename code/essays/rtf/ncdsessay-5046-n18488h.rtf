I wan't to live on a farm and have a lot of animals, like cats, dogs, cows, sheep, pigs, maybe 1 horse, *** I may be married at that age and I might not be. I love little children I would like to have a boy and girl one or two girls. I like children because they are nice to talk to and have fun with . When I have a house of my own I would like it to be not to big not more than four bedrooms , 2 toilets , 1 kitchen , a lounge , and a living room. My home life is I hope is going to be a happy one . I would get up in the morning milk the cows and when I am finished I would go in and get the children ready for school and get their breakfast ready and then get them off to school and then have my own After that I would get on with the house work, making the beds, baking, cooking, washing, ect. My work will just be on the farm If I do live on a farm and I hope I do it will be milking the cows and other odd jobs on the farm and my house work I do hope very much that I do live on a farm.
