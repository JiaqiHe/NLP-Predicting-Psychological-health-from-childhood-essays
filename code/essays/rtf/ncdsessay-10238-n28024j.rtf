Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old. I live in the town of [town]. I am a footballer and I have lots of other interests like bird-watching, collecting records, stamp collecting and many others. I was married when I was 16 years old and I have never had an arguement with my wife. In my spare time at home I make model ships, I also have a sports shop in the high street. On Sundays I just laze about doing nothing. I am a member of the [town] Wheelers, (a cycling club), and I enjoy cycling a lot. Often I will go down to the pub and have a drink with some of my friends. I very rarely watch television but I often listen to the radio or the record player. Every tuesday, thursday, Friday and Saturday I go to my football ground, which is at [town] for training. My wife doesn't mind at all. Another thing I like doing is going for rides in cars. I enjoy seeing all the country side and I always find it interesting. Every so often I take my wife for a ride or a picnic. We both enjoy it very much. Well thats how I get on during the week and I enjoy every bit of it.  Words: 218
