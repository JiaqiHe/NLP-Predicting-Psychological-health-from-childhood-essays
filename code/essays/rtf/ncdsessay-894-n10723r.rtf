At the age of twenty five I hope to be marred and have unlest one child. When the child is young I will stay at home, when the child go to school I will go to work. I will hope to have another child about 2 year after. I would like to work with a computer or be a typise. I won't my husband to be helpfull in the house with the children. I would like a white wedding, and not to live in [town].

I hope to have enough money but not to be too rich and not too poor. To have a nice house and nice cloth for me and my family. But I would like to live near my mother and vister her ever so offern.  Words: 128
