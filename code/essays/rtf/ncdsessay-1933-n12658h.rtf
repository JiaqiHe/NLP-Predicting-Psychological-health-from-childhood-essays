About two months ago it was my tewentyfifth birthday. I remember going to school at [school name]* where I went on to [school name] School. I left school at fifteen years of age whe I went to the youth employment sevice. They asked me what I wanted to be. I wanted to join a football team so* they gave me the facts and I decided not to be a footballer. I decided then to be a salvage diver. but there again you may run out of air and die. I had a go at other jobs but none came to my fancy until I came at last to a bus conductors job. Next day I read in the paper that three thugs had badly assulted a bus conductor. I went back to the youth employment service where we had a chat I then decided to become a school teacher. Now I am marryed and have two children and am headmaster of my school in London.
