My new job is to go around the world colelcting animals. First I went to the African jungles where I was meet my a chief. He said that he would lend me some of he hunters to help me in catching some wild animals. We were walking through the jungle went one of the hunters came up to me and told me that there was a python under a rock not far ahead. We got a forked stick a a net ready to catch it in. Soon we arrived at the rock. One of the hunters went to the other end of the rock and begun to tap it while I stood on top with the forked stick in my hand. The rest of the hunters held the net. Soon the python began to come out of the rock I put the forked end of the stick on the python and the others throw the net on top if it. This way we caught a lot of snakes. The chief and he men also caught me alot of animals which I took back to England on a boat. The zoo was at [city]. My home is not in [city] it is in [town] and is not far from the pear. Each saterday when I am not at the zoo I go to the pier or to the cinima.  Words: 228
