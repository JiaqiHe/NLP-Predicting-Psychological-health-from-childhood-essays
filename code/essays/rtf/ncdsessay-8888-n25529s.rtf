My name is (name) and I work in a Library witch I like very much. I have got a fair amount of girl friends and one boyfriend who I am going to get married to in 2 moths time.
I go out to 2 diferent clubs one is a youth club and the other a Judo club. I live about 40 miles away from mum and Dad who live in (town).
I n two months times when I get married, I will not have children straight away because  I feel that you have s*** away changing babies napys etc. and never getting time to go out in the evening. My ********* can't *vanage to take me out every evening since he is studying for a degree. Some times on sunday I go to tennis club. I altogether I have a very pleasant life.  Words: 141
