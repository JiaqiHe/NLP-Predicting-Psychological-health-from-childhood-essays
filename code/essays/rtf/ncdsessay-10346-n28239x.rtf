----------------------
I am now twenty five, married with two children. My family and I live in a detached house, my husband works as an engineer. I do not go to work because of my children. When they are older I will. One goes to a play school the other one stays at home. I'll have put in an advert for some one to baby-sit so I can go to work. My mother-in-law wonders why because she says she would after them but I say no. I might work as I telephonist or short hand typeist. Yes I will work as a short hand typeist, I do hope he would not be a grumpy sort of  boss. I hope he gives me a nice salary so I can  buy some new clothes for [male name] because he needs some trousers, he has a big hole in the knee. [female name] needs a new dress and shoes, she looks like a rag and bone man. What shall I get for dinner, I may get sausages and chips. or liver and mashed potatoes with vegetables. Oh no thats the milk boiling over. I'll have to get this cleaning done before I have my break. I feel like a slave working morning and afternoon, it really means more work than if I did not go to work, but we do need the money so I don't mind more work.  Words: 234
