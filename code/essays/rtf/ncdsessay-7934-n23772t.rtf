I have a job which is a bank clerk. I am married and have one child who is 18 months old. In my job I work in an office. it brings in a nice income. I have an Uncle who does the same job as I do, my sister works in a bank also. I spend quite a lot of time with my son when I am not working. I would like my son to become a bank clerk like myself but I will not force him. I like very much to do do-it-yourself jobs and do some when I am not with my son. I do not live in a house but live in a bungalow. I am interested in motor racing and when I was younger I was a fan of Graham Hill. My wife does not work because she has to look after the baby. I have a car which is a sports car, I only use it which going to work, though I sometimes take the baby out in it. I used to go to college and left about three years ago. I liked it at college and I did not think I would leave as early as I did. The money I had to pay for my digs went up by half, so I left. I was lucky to get the job I've got because I am only 26 years old. I am hoping to get to be a bank manager because I would have more work, I like the work, and I would recieve a larger income. When I was about twelve. I wanted to become a footballer but appeared to be not good enough.  Words: 281
