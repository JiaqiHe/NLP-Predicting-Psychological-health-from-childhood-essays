When I'm 25 I wish to be married. I will have a husband who is a manager of somewhere. I will have twin girls who are one, and I dress them alike I get up in the morning at 8, O clock and see my husband off to work. It is a Saturday morning. Then at 9pm, I get Melanie and Carol dressed. We have breakfast and then go shopping in the white sports car. We live in America. We go to the big supermarket in New York. When we come out of the supermarket my husband is waiting for me, because on Saturday he only works in the morning. We then go home and have Sheperd's Pie for dinner. We live in the country in a very big mansion, and have servants. In the afternoon we let the children play out while we go swimming in our swimming pool. It is nearly always very warm in America. After that we have our afternoon tea in the garden. We all then go for a gallop round the countryside on our horses we then go back and have tea and put the children to bed. Every Saturday night we have a ball. The people arrive at 7 o clock and go at 1. Then we are very tired. In the morning we don't get up till 11pm. When we do get up we go to church, and then have a very quiet Sunday.  Words: 242
