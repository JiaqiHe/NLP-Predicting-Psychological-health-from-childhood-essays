The life I am leading now is very pleasant. I am very interested in horses as I live in the country side were there is alot of horses. I live in a flat. My work is a short hand typist and I enjoy it very much I work with some other gitls the smae age as myself. Before I was a short hand typist I went to College at London. There I learnt how to type. When I was at college I did not go to my flat. When I had time off I went to visit my mother and father. Not long after I bought a house of my own where there was more room. 
My life is very god Somtimes I go out to paries which is very far away. I went out to Australia where I loved it so much I paid for my father and mother to come out and live with me there.  Words: 158
