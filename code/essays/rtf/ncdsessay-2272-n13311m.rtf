Hello I am working at the [company name] my job is a welder. What I have to do is wait for the sheets of metal to come into the welding shop then I get the welding eqipment and place the metal sheets on the bench and weld the bits together we mostly make gas cookers. After I finish making them they go on to the testing* department. At home I read books and make gliders with engines in them. After I finish I go to [location] and fly them. They run on a pint of petrol. Also at home I do electrical odd-jobs. At home I decorate the rooms. On Saturday's I have a part time job as a welding lecturer. I teach about the gases we use in welding. I also teach about other parts of the eqiptment.  Words: 139
