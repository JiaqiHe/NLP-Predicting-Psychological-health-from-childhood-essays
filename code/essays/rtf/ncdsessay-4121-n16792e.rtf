when I am 25 I hope to be a football player our a teacher. If I was a teacher I like to teach English and work in a junior school one day I hope to go to college and study my prefesion, but on the other hand I would like to be a football player and play for Tottenham Hotspur. one day I hope to play at Wembley. But I would not like to get married. my interests would be to play football and do exurcises. I would live in a big house and be famous like all profecional football players. And I would like to give my Autogrsphs to the young supporters. I wish one day my name would be printed on every newspaper. or I could be a teacher and teach young people about 7 - to 9 years of age and try to be the headmaster of the school . I would go home every night and mark the books. I cannot choose between these two jobs but I think I might be a football player. Football is an active game and thats why I think I will be a football player. my favorete hobby is football and as I said my only dream his to play for Tottenham and go to wembley and retire when I am 37 years old. I am quit a good footballer now and util that day* I will train and play football my best in every match I play and my hobby will help me play better football   my hobbys  swimming rugby tennis cricket football netball  Words: 265
