Then after a good nights sleep I Start of to work again back in to the office adding up money and keeping accounts for nearly everything but I hardly ever thing of getting married. But when it comes to my holidays I get as far away as I can from England like Australia where the Sun is So hot that in the shade you nearly sweat to death but the thing I most regreat is that I might be called back to England but when I finish my holiday its back to England and back to* the same old Job but I like to put my feet up some time and read a good book or go to a home* football match which relaxes me a lot from my work but I am always thinking of being a Lawyar dealing with law I thing it will be much more fun than being a Bank accountent but as I said before I always look forward to the future some how I thing I will be getting promotion in a few year time which will be fun bossing a few people about for a change instead of me being bossed about. I always remember at School that I would be a proffiomal football player I can remeber when I I played for the football team for 2 year's that was great fun is my school days but I am a bank accountent with a hard working Job but I still like it.
