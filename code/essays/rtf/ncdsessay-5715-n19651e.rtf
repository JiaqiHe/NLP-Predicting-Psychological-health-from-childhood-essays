I am short-hand-typist and every week day I go to work and meet all my pals. When tea break comes we have a 'natter' and then go back to work. After a days' work I go home and help prepare the tea. Dad comes home and we start tea. We have another 'chat' till tea-times over. I take the dog a walk if it's not raining and sometimes go to one of my friends and go to the pictures.
      When Saturday comes I get up and dressed and go down and have breakfast. It is always hectic on a Saturday as my friend comes round and we go to [city]. A main interest of mine is to look round some clothes for special occaisions. We, usually get back from [city] about two o'clock and at three o'clock I have my hair set at the hairdressers, for when my boyfriend comes. I try to be smart and on time for when he comes but I never am. I am engaged to be married to him, but, I don't suppose we shall ever get married. We sometimes go to his parents and sometimes go ice-skating. That brings the end of a usual Saturday. On a Sunday I am up and dressed by about nine o'clock and start to help making the dinner. On a Sunday we usually go out after dinner to the pictures of anything in that line*. This is one of the few times the whole family goes out together. 
      At home their is always a friendly atmosphere, an atmosphere that is never quite the same anywhere else.  Words: 269
