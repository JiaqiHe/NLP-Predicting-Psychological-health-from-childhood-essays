My work is a Macanic, Football, Cricket. My leading life is footballing you have too work very hard, and it is hard training, Macanical things are hard, and Cricket is dangerous because if the batsman hits it very hard it might go it your eye or something. When I get maried I am going to have 4 Children 2 Girls and 2 boys. I am going to dress them well. I am going to have a little flat, my children are going to be called, [name], [name], [name], [name]. And when they are all 19 or 20 they can come to see me play Cricket and Football. We are going live in [town], and go to [town] C.P. School. And if the swimming pool is still there they can go in that every Tuesday, if the date isn't* changed. And I think would love it, they would learn to swim very easy. They could have two of which Animal they wont but if they have pigoos they could have four of them, because they would be lonely they would have two Hens and two Cocks, because they would mate, if they had a dog they would have one, because they would get in the nums way.
