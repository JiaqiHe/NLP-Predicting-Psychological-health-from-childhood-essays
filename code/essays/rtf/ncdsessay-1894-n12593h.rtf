I amk training to be a district nurse and I should soon be going to a small country village I hope. I have many friends at the collage and I often go out with them.
I share a flat with a friend [female name] [surname] and between us we keep it quite clean.
I go home at weekends and look after my pet dog Sparky. I have once or twice tried to write a book but with no luck and my parents think I made a wise choice in my job. 
This year I am going to Austria for my holidays and I have been there before and I enjoyed myself very much indeed. I have some friends there and I will stay with them. On some of the mountains there is still some snow and as I am a good skier I will be sking. I like swimming as well and as there are many good swimming places I will be in good swimming form.
I think I will enjoy being a district nurse and I hope to lead a happy life.  Words: 180
