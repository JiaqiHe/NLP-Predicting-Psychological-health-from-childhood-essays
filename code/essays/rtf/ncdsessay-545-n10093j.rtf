When I am twenty five, I hope to be at University. Later on during that year I want to marry and have a family. I want to have two children, preforably a girl and a boy. Soon after we have settled in a house, I would like to take up art as my. full time job. Art has allways been my hobby. It is interesting to see hour each painting begins to form, into something worth while. Painting is quite interesting. If I did not qualify for art, I would earn my living a a drumer. My great chance for druming came at a Christmas concert at school. Then, thanks to my headmaster I went to Leeds Music centre to learn the drums. I have my own drum and I have just been in a concert at the Town Hall. Mostly I would like to drum to Jazz. I also hope to go to other countries for my holidays. I have allways wanted to go to America. I want to make my famalies life happy aswell as my own. I want this all to happen because twenty five is an important age for any person, who wants to lead a good life.  Words: 202
