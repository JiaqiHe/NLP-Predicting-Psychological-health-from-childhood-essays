My job is nursing and I find it very interesting I have been at nursing for six years. The name of the hospital is ****. 
     I am married to a manger of a bank and have two children aged 4 months and 1 year. Their names are Sarah and Jennifer Williams. We live in London in a huge horse we have been living in London for half a year now and we find the neighbours very friendly. 
     I have a friend and go out with her occasionaly. She is a schoolfriend and her name is ****. We talk about old schooldays and the laughs we had at teachers when I go out I leave Sarah and Jennifer in care of our neighbour, because my husband doesn't come home until 10 o'clock. 
     We have a cook and a maid and the cook does the most d*bious* dishes. She is very kind to the children.
     As I have said my job is nursing at **** Hospital. I am a staff Nurse and have taken many exams in which I have passed I wish to stay on at nursing until I am about thirty years of age. At that age I will perhaps be a sister. 
     My life is very interesting and I hope it will go on like this. 
     My interests and hobbies are nursing, going out with schoolfriends and I like children very much escepially if they are not spoilt.  Words: 244
