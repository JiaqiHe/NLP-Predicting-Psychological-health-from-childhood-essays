going down the street and buying meseges and looking after babies while their mothers out. I would like to get married and have children. I would like to be a typist since I am by twenty. Before I go on typing I would like to go to college. at home I would like to cook. I am not only interested in typing but teaching being a gym teacher to. I am typing in an office in a factory or even in a school and typ what they are needing like songs and poems or even typ out letters. I would be mostly going to visit. people and going to church on a Sunday. I go to visit my grandfather because he is ninty. My grand-mother to she is sixty-five. I would go into all the shops and buy some food. I would try dress-making to. Every frock I made I would wear it. another thing I would like to be is a net ball teacher teaching girls how to play at net-ball and I making them win the cup. Sometimes I would buy my clothes and other times I would make them. I would make thing like skirts, dresses, and blouses.  Words: 201
