I am living in a flat quite near the beach. I am married, and have two children and a dog. The girl is three years old, her name is [name], the boy is 18 months and his name is [name]. My husbands name is [name], and the dog is called [name]. Our sir - name is [name]. I am a housewife, but when the children are old enough to go to school I hope to be a short-hand typist. My husband is an engineer and he gets paid farely well. He goes to work at 1/2 past 7 to be there at 8 oclock, a.m. And leaves off work at 5 oclock.p.m. When he comes home the tea is already on the table waiting for him. I work* on a monday. There is three bedrooms in the flat, with a double bed in each of them. We have a bathroom and showers are attached to it.  Words: 156
