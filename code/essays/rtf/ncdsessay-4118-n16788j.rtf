I am married I have one child she is one year of age. I live in a nice house it is not rentered I bought it. It is a very difficult life for me because I am a nurse and my mother or my husband has to look after my child We donot live very far from the hospital. I am very good for making my own dresses and my child dresses. I am also interested in knitting. I am in the children hospital. I very often see my husband. My mother just lives a v* few door away from us. We have very good pe* friends they are very kind to my child her name is [name] she can say Mammy and Daddy. She has a pet rabbit she can walk very good. I like to read when I am not making dresses or knitting. When I get the day off I just sit and watch the telivision. I like to see my child playing well with her bear. She always looks out of the window to see if her daddy is if he is she always shouts daddy daddy runs to the door. She is very noisy the only U* time when I get peace is when she goes to bed.  Words: 213
