I am twenty five years old and I am a builder working for ****. I get up in The morning at 7 o'clock and hove* my  breakfast and then ride my motor bike to work. When i get to work I start building houses and at diner time I go to a cafey* and order my diner. After that I go back to work and start building again, at the end of the I go home to my family and then sit down for a Quater of an hour then have my tea and perhaps go fishing for an hour in the river when I get home I would get changed and sit down to whach T.V. till eleven o-clock then go bed and start again in the morning. At weekends I would do some jobs around the house and perhaps go shooting in the evening across the feilds. On sundays I would go to church and when I come home do some gardening or go for a walk in the evening. On holidays I would go to Spain and get sunburnt whaching the bull fights or go swiming in the sea.  Words: 192
