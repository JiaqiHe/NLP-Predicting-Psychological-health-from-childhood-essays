May 1969.

I'm a girl and I am 25 years old.
I'm married to a very nice man and I'm a hairdresser. Me and my husband live in a flat. I have no children at all. I go to work at 10. o, clock and the hair dressers close at 1 to 2 then I go back to work until half past five. My husband works on the (name of work) ( and so did my father ). If he is early turn he goes about half past four, half past five or six o, clock in the morning and would come home about 4 o, clock in the afternoon.
If i have any children perhaps one boy and one girl I would like to call the boy (name of child) and the girl (name of child). I live in a very nice flat but we thought of moving somewhere else because we live near the main road and it is very noisey, we thought of moving into modern house some where not quite so near the main road.
On Sundays we go out and walk around the park, which is down the town, and then we do the shopping  Words: 198
