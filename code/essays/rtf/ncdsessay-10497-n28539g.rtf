I start work at eight o' clock every morning and finish at 4 30.p.m. every day of the week bar a saturday when I finish at 12 a.m. I am a (company) employee, my job is repairing computers and sometimes I have to go to foreign countries such as France, Italy, Germany etc, with exspenses paid, the reasons why I usually have to go to some of these places is that maybe on the road to these foreign places they can be damaged and need reapaired. They have to pack the computers in special cases to help save them from being damaged. (company) have about two orthree lorries of their own, but that is not enough so they hire ****** lorries.
