Every day when I wake up I have to get ready for work which is 4 miles down the road. My children are very cheerful and happy and my husband is away on business. My mother looks after the children whilst I am away. I work at a school teaching small children. I like teaching children because of their activity and play. If the children are disbehaving I have to shout at them which I hate doing but it does not happen very often. When I get home I spend a lot of my time with the children and play games with them. After tea I put them to bed and start knitting or read magazines which are interesting. I usually go to bed at 10.30 but if I am extra tired I have an early night and go to bed at 10.00 When my husband comes home from work on leave we often go to night-clubs or to the cinema. One of my children will be coming to my school next year and she is looking forward to it as much as I am. Her name is [female name] after my mother. At the school there is a small swimming pool which the infants use three times a week. When the children want to do some acting we go out onto the lawn which is quite big. I have a few hobbies which are swimming, horse riding and cooking. At the weekends we go shopping and then go down to the beach which the children like better than anything but sometimes we go and see relations.  Words: 267
