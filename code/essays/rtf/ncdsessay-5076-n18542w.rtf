I am a docter at the London Hospital. I start work quite early in the morning. I have many kinds of patients. There are many kinds of patients who when they come to this hospital are very ill. Others come in for minor things such as having a bunion cut off which is minor compared with some cases. In most cases we can cure the disease or illness which is troubling the person. But in a few cases I or no one else can cure the disease. If there is definatly nothing else we can do the hospital sends them home for they have not got enough beds for them to stay in. I am married with one child. Sometimes in the night my husband and I often awake to the sound of the telephone ringing. It is usually to say that there has been an accident or someone is very ill. I dress as quickly as I can and drive to the place where my help is needed. My husband does't like this but this is my job. Sometimes when I get a day off I try to cram as much in as I can. I take my little girl shopping with me. That takes about an hour. When we get home I do some cooking like making pastry and cakes and tarts. Before that I do the beds tidy hoover and dust the sitting room. When I have finished making the pastry. I cook the dinner. With the rest of my time I do odd jobs around the house. this is what my life is like.  Words: 268
