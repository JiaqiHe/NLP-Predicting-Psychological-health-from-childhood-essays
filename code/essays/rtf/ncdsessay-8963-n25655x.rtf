I live in [town] in a bungalow I am married with two children a girl and a boy. I am quiet happy at home with my family. Somtimes when I am at home I may do some tiping. At night when the children are asleep I write poetry. My working life is as a teacher in the district school teaching infants. I enjoy teaching them to read and write most of all and all like teaching little bits about nature and art. My intrest is in writing poetry and storys I aim to be a writer.  Words: 96
