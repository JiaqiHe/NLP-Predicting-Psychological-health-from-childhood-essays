I was married to a girl of 21 years of age. I was getting home one evening when I spotted a dog lying by the side of the kerb. As I was getting out of the car I saw blood slithering down its body. My first intention was to bathe the wound, I got a container of water out of the car, for I keep a fresh supply. After washing the wound I took it to the vet. My wife asked were have I been and I told her the story. I then settled down to a hot meal after which I got out my stamp album and sorted then out. My wife suggested we went to bed so that we could have an early start in the morning. Soon after we were safely snug in bed. It was Saturday the next day, which was my day off. As I was a keen swimmer so I went swimming that day I meet some young friends there and we splashed each other. After swimming I went to a pub and meet some more friends and we had a sing-song. Then I departed and went home as soon as I got home I washed the car.  Words: 204
