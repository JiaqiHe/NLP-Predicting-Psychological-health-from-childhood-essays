My age is 25 years old I am married. I have no children. In my spare time I like to cook or read. I like to go out quite a bit. I am a school teacher and I teach severn and eight year olds. I work from nine o'clock untill four o' clock. When I get home I like to rest for about half an hour then I do the house work because I am not able to do it early in a morning. In my holidays I like to go on long holidays with my husband. to different places. Everywhere I go I like to take our dog, an Alsation with* me. The dog does not usually come on holiday with us it stays in kennels. Every night when my husband gets home we take the dog into the park, then after that we sometimes go to my mothers. or his mothers. I am not a late sleeper and I am usually up at least two hours before I go to work.  Words: 173
