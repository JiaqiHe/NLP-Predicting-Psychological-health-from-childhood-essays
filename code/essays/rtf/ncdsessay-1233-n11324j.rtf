----------------------
I am now 25 and I am married to a blonde young lady who works for a coal merchant in [town] which is were we live.
      Our house is on an estate, and it has a kitchen and a dining room combined so my wife does not have to walk far to serve dinner. We also have a living room, a toilet, a bathroom, two bedrooms, and one is our room and the other is for our little girl [name] who is two years old.
      In the back garden I have a model layout its gauge is 5 1/4 inches although we have gone over to the Metric system. At the moment I am planning to build an extension to my layout, this will include 4 pairs of points and about 50 yards of track and hundreds of nails.
      My job is to assist the manager of an oil company in problems you might say I was an advisor. 
      I get to [city] by southern region electric, yesterday I went first class to [station] to go to [shop] in [road] to by some track for my TT gauge railway, as I have two railways.
      It is saturday tommorow and I will be running my model Brittania class locomotive on my large layout.  Words: 213
