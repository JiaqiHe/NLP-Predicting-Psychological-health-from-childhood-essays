I am now a police woman I take children across the roads One day i caught a little boy trying to cross the road all by himself. So I ran to him and took him by the hand across the road. I also take care of traffic. I am good as a police woman most of the time I am looking after children and taking them across the road. I go up in the morning at 7 am. and come home at 10p. m. when I get home I tidy the house up a little bit and then get something to eat and drink and then go straight to bed . When I get a holiday I go to the sea side and have a swim, But if it is raining I stay in the house and do s ome house work. My mother some times stays with me and some times I stay with her . I am now a sargant and I like it very much. I tell some beginers what to do , thats if they dont know what to do. I s till look after children and I still look after roads and the traffic .
