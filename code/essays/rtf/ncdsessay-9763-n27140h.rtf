I am a typist and I enjoy it very much. I type a lot at home if I have nothing to type I use letters that I have received. I am engaged to be married the boy I am going with is a doctor. In my spare time I go to the cinema with my boyfriend. When I get married I will carry on being a typist but my boyfriend wants to become something else instead of a doctor we have not decided yet. We both would like 2 - 4 children. The man I am working for is very nice, I get one week holiday. We are getting married on the 15th of May and to-day is the 29 of April. My mother has arranged the cake the organist etc. On Saturday I am going to look for a wedding dress. My holidays are over and I am back at work. I have a bundle of letters to be typed I am half way through them now. It is about lunch time and I have about five more letters to type. The canteen is very nice and I always go there for my dinner I get one hour for my lunch. I am now back at work now I have almost finished the letters. It is nowe time to go home when I gat home I shall sit with my feet up and watch Television. I am glad it is the end of another hard days work.  Words: 248
