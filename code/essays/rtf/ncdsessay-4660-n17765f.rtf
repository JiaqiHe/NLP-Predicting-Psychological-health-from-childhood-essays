A Bachelor, now leaving colledge to a fixed job, a draughtsman at the age of twenty five. I have a good steady job which I have wanted all my school life. The job first apealed to me when I was a young boy at the age of 9, when I read in an ensiclopedia about the life of a draughtsman. My interests are, fishing, and modle making although most of my time is spent in studying. My working hours are from eight o' clock in the morning to four o' clock at night. A draughtmans job is to designe bridges and other things. As the main office is some thirty miles away I have to get up at seven o' clock and arive back home at five o' clock.  Words: 129
