I am 25, I have been married for seven years and have three children. I earn my living as a dancing teacher and I am training to become a professional ballerina, as I have enjoyed dancing all my life. I also enjoy surfing and singing in my spare time. I live in the country and my husband is a keen gardener. The country is a fine place to live in. Every morning I wake up, get dressed and have strawberries from the garden, and cream from our cow Buttercup, then I do my housework as normal. Firstly I clean out the rooms, make the beds, wash the breakfast dishes and wash small articles of clothing. Then I wait for the shop on wheels, owned by mr.Thomas, to arrive, then, from him, I buy things for dinner. After dinner, I catch a bus into town and buy lots of different things, including things for tea. Then I go straight to meet my children from school, take the shopping home and then we go for a long walk to make the children ready for bed. When they have gone, my husband comes home from work. Then we have an early supper together and go straight to bed to wake up early and refreshed the next morning.  Words: 214
