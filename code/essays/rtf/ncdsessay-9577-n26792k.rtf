A normal life and I have wife, children and two dogs they are both young alsaitains. I go to work at an office and have central heating. I have got a canary and the year would be 1983. The children would be 3 or 4 years old. I would try to get a cottage in the country. The city would be very modern and the schools would be a lot better. televios would be worked by remote controlled signals Most things work by the touch of a button  Words: 88
