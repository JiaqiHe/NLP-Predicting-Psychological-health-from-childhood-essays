"I am twenty five and I am an archeoligest in Britain. I am hoping I will find something to dog for. At the week ends I come home and do some gardening. I'm also very interested in astronamony. I hope one day they will land on a planet like mars and venus. When I do get spare time I read books about stars. I've been to lots of places but never found anything. If I do not find anything in Britain I might go abroad to Egipt or places like that. There's a big dig on up in Scotland and I'm digging. They think there was an old village there once but their not shore. I shall be digging in Scotland in a weeks time so I can join in with the dig. In the mean time I've got to dig in Rutland because pots have been found there. I'm doing that in two days time. For the next two days I will be at home reading about stars.
Two days has gone.
I'm getting up and setting off for Rutland I'm taking seven people with me so I'm not doing all the hard work on my own. I'm not liviing far from Rutland so I can get there in about forty five minutes. When I got there we started digging. We didn't find anything the first day but we kept battling on suddenly somebody shouted ""I've found some pots"" and we all rushed there together. I said ""He's right you know."" Afterwards we found a lot more and we discovered an axe. At the end of the week we went to Scotland but we found no clues to the village."  Words: 279
