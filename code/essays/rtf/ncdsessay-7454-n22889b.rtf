Last day at school was such an exciting event I thought as the 3rd baby was in my arms screaming as if it was alarmed that I was not takeing much interest in it. As I glanced down its smudged little face changed in to a broad smile with added chirping. Then it was feeding time as I was not able to feed it myself it departed into an other room with a nurse. A sudden thought spring in to my mind what are the people doing without a ver to look after their sick animals with this thought I went through the day. But also with an happier thought of the coming day when I would be going back to the friendly familia surroundings then I layed on the springy pillow's and droped off to the world of my dreams to awaken to the home going and vet's work. At early down I awaken from my deep slumber and to the rejoying event of an all most a trip to paridice like every thing the events all ways come sooner or later.  Words: 183
