My flat is very modern and is very easy to clean. I go to Collage and go to see my parents. I share my flat with a School friend she is very nice. I often go to parties and dances with my friend. Next week I'm going to see my parents and to go to a ball. In my flat I've got a lot of inflatable chairs. The kitchen is very nice with a dish washer in it.
Next month I'm getting married to a very rich and god looking man. I plane to have 2 children a girl and a boy (twins I hope). My children are going to be very good. We will have 2 colour T.V.'s. In our garden we will have an enormouse and posh swimming pool. The children's names are [male name] and [female name] and our sirname is [surname].  Words: 144
