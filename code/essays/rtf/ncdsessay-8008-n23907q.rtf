"I am now 25 years old and I am working in an orphanage home where all the children who have not any parents or relations. live Although the children have not got any parents they are happy by the things that they are occupied with One little boy whose name is Bobby is very sad because he has not long been with us and he has still not got over the shock of his parent's death. He sits in the corner of the room sulking all day. All the children try to cheer him up but he still will not join in any of the games one day when Bobby was all alone in his room I went up to him and said ""Bobby what is the matter with you why won't you play with any of the other children! ""I want my mummy and daddy where is mumy and daddy! said Bobby. Well your mummy and daddy have gone to see Jesus which was the only way I could put it to him to make him understand but you will soon have another one of you will not cry anymore. Well the next day I was working a my desk watching the children playing then I saw Bobby playing cowboys and indians with some other little boys I went up to him and said ""Do you feel better now Bobby! Oh yes he said I want to show my new mummy and daddy how clever I am. Oh who are these people that are just coming in. Oh its your new mummy and daddy come to collect you. Hello mummy hello daddy I want to come home home and live with you. Allright then! said the lady good bye my love I said to him good bye."  Words: 298
