My life is interesting and I live by my self. 
My interests is going out like the pictures.
My home is a flat in London my life is happy and my work is a tiypist. It is enjoying life I go out with my friends and I go out shopping, after I have been a tiypist I would like to be a dress maker, making clothes. Sometimes I would go and visit my mum and dad and sisters. For my holidays I would like to go to New-Zealand.  Words: 87
