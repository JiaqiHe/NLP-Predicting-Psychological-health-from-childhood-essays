I am 25 year old now I am a cook in the Army I get xxxx25 a week and I am married I have no children. My favilate hobby is making modles. My work is in a hot kitchen it is 100' in here but I don't mind. I lead a good live I am home with my wife at 19.00hrs and I cook tea. My wife and I live in the front of the baricks. I am intrested in modles and art. I think my life is all right but some times I have to do dutys and I can not come home until 21.00 hrs. the next night. Once on Easter day we had no cook and so I took over and I cooked so well they put me in charge of cooking the meals and that is how I becam the Army's best cook. At home I like to watch the television and read my books and the news paper. On Sundays I sleep in and my wife dose the cooking for the men and us.  Words: 179
