When I am 25 years of age The work which I will be doing is cooking, dress making with a sewing machine and going on holidays. My home will be a nice home but not very Pohse as some people often have them. My interests will be sometimes siting at home with the children, and going to my mams house to see how she is getting on, I hope that the life which I am leading will be a happy life, a good life, and not a sad or unhappy life, I will get married, and settle down in a lovely house, as I told you at the beging of the story I was not going to have a very pohse house, and also the other work is looking for a job something like dress making, or hat making, or a typist, my other intrests are going to the beach on a morning. I will also bye a car and a caravan. and in that caravan I would have a kettle and a sink and a bed, and also I will have a wardrobe. I thing that that is all now. there is one more thing I think I might get married at nineteen or twenty.  Words: 206
