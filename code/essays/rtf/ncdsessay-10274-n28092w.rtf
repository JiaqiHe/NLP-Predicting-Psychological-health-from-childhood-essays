Most of my interests at the age of 25 would be to be a famous Horse rider. And in my spare time to do my work as a secatary in a bank or somewhere like that. I'm very intrerested in animals and would keep lots of animals on a farm with Husband. I would like two children a boy and a girl and I'd teach them how to ride. I would like my parents to come over every Sunday so that they could see how my husband and I were keeping and that I could see how my parents looked. I would like to stop work when my husband had got a very wealthy job. I'd go down to the shops every Tuesday, have my hair done Wednesday and do all the washing of clothes on Monday. Have a quiet day Thursday, invite local friends Friday for a coffee and Saturday go riding. Sunday Church. Sunday afternoon I would like the children for a walk in the park.
Every Easter I would have my husband's parents round. August would be the time for our Summer Holiday. And on Christmas day we would visit london to see the big Christmas tree. The children would go to bed at eight o'clock and I would go to bed at ten o'clock. I would rise at 8o'clock get Breakfast. Dinner would be ready by 1 o'clock and supper at 7'o'clock. The animals on the farm which I would have would be dogs, horses, chickens and cows.  Words: 251
