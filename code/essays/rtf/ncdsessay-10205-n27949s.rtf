I am now 25 I am maryed and have got a child. My next door neighbour looks after while I go to work. I work at the childrens office in [town]. It is across the road from the police Station in [town]. Some other people and I, have to look after children who haven't got homes. I only do three hours work there then I go home and do the house work like washing the dirty clothes and cleaning the house all over. My hoby is gardening I like gardening very much. We have a big garden to tidy up so thats all right. Also I like making things sometimes not very often though. It is nice when you are young because you can do things of that when you are old. I like it. At christmas we give toys away to the home less children. At work this is. It is very unfortunate for those children.  Words: 157
