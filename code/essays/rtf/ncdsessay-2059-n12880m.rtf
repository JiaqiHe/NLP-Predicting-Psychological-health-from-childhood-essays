When I am 25 years old I should like to be a nurse, and a music tea*her as well. I should nurse in the morning and play in the afternoon. I hope I shall be living with my parents. Perhaps I might have a motor like ** car. I should still keep on *isting to my forgein penfriends and sometimes pop over to them. If I am not living with my parents I would buy a 3 roomed flat in ****. I should like to play my violin at concerts and go swimming now and again. I would lik to work on the Mat*on wa*d at the hospital and be a sister or a S.R Nurse. I would go out to cinema and go to see friends. I should buy a television or radio to listen to in the evenings. I would buy thousands of books to read, and buy a lot of french cheese. I should go shopping every week, and collect stamps. I should still collect dolls for my shef and most of all I should still take my teddy bear* to bed with me at night. I should like to be a sunday school teacher, and keep up a walk on a day that I did'nt work and go and see my grand parents once a week. I would garden in my spare time and cook as well.
