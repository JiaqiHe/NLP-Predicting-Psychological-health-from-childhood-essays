"I am twenty five, for a living I work on my aunties farm. I look after my aunts pets she has three young cats two dogs and a guine pig. Today I am going into town for six dozen bags of fertilizer. I will be going in the tractor which is my favorite vehical. The dogs (Timmy and Rex) do not like the tractor because it traped them against a wall when its brake sllipped of and rolled down the hill. Soon I will reach the market but before I buy the fertilizer I am going to look at the cattal at the cattal market which is my favorite hobby. ""Clang"" I have crashed into a wall, before I could realise I had abbsent mindely turned into a CUL-DE-SAC the doctor says there is no hope for me so I bring my story a sad end."  Words: 146
