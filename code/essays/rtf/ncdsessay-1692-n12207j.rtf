My name is [male name] [surname] I am 25 years old. one morning I was just getting ready to go to work, when I felt sick so I thought I had better have the morning off. I live in a big house with my wife and we have got a child called [male name]. Our house stands back off the road. I am a wages clerk and I work not far from my home in a small firm. Some nights my wife and I go out after tea and sometimes we stop in. In the afternoon I went back to work and the boss asked me where I had been in the morning. I told him I had not been very well. That night when I got home I had my tea and then I watched television. And at half-past ten I watched the football match. Then at twelve o'clock I went to bed. And that was another day over but tomorrow I would be working in the office again.  Words: 170
