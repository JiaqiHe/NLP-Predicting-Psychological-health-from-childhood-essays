I am now an ametuer footballer. Every Saturday after noon we have a matcch I am left footed and left handed and my position is left winger. I am not married and I live with a team mate in a flat we rent. On Tuesdays and Thursdays there is a training session and on Friday evening a pre-match briefing on moves and tactics in the game to be played the next day. Between us my mate and I run a small sports shop in the hig h street. In some of my spare time I make soveneirs like rosetes and badges in our teams colours. Although I am a player* myself I often go to see [football club], who are now succsesfully in Division 1, play. I think that the best match at the valley is when Manchester United pay* their visit. Often this match is a draw but occasionly someone wins, usually United. Very shortly our team will be going to South America for an ametuer tournament. A few weeks ago a great thing happened in the history of the club we won the ametuer cup. At the start of the season I was picked as captain of our side and I was very pleased to be told I was the captain for the final. As we had anticipated our opponents had a sharp attack but occasionly left their defence open. The skill of our inside left brought our attack straight into the gap and I scored the only goal of the match.  Words: 254
