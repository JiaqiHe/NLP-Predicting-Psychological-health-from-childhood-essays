Now that I am 25 and I have left college I think I will go and ask for a interview at the fire station and in my spare time I will do what I used to do as a young lad I will collect stamps and make models out of balsa wood and I will give them away to children. I am intrested in a lot of thing like games, reading, stamp-collecting, but the thing I am most intrested in is bird-watching their are many kinds of birds in the world their are blue-tits, greytits, black-birds, song thrush, and many others Their are so many I dont remember all of their names. I live in Manchester but I was born in [London borough]. The name of the country I live in is England and I like it here very much. I worked in a sweet factory in liverpool before I left college it was called barrets sweet factory.  Words: 158
