I am leading a verry happy life. My home life is never lonely. I live in a flat. The people who live in the other flats next to me are old people who are not really interested in the younger genouration. I am not married but I have many other freinds who live a few streets away from me and I have a boy freind I work for a very I am his assistant. I go to work at 9 O clock am and have a half hour rest for dinner and go home at 4.30 p.m Thursday is my day off and I usually go shopping then. And I have Sunday off and sometimes Saturday. I love animals a great deal and I hope I soon will be a vet. I have a pet dog, three gold fish and two canaries. These are all animals that people asked the vet to have destroyed. But I couldn't bear to see these innosent animals be put to sleep. I am not really ment to keep the animals but I pleaded with the person who rented the flats and soon he gave in. I often play tennis and go riding or to bowling alleys in my spare time. I love going for long walks with my pet spaniel. I have been wondering wether to move into the country where it would be nearer the vet and I would be able to have more pets and give them more exercise because my pet spaniel does not get quite anough exercise living in the town. I always have something nice to do.  Words: 268
