I go to work every weekday and If it is sunny in summer I go down to the lake to bathe or if it is not very hot I sometimes go for a walk. I sometimes go out in the car for a drive. If it is raining I often get out my stamp album and stamps and sort them out or stick them into the album. I have to goldfish they are just ordinary Shubunkins. I have a cat too. I go to dances when I can. I work as a hairdresser in the town. On Saturday mornings I go shopping I hardly ever go in the week. I like to have for my lunch sausage and creamed potato or roast and for second course rice and peaches or ice cream and strawberry's. I like to go riding. I borrow horses from a stable across the lake. I like sewing my own dresses at home but I don't like knitting. I get a two week holiday in the summer. I like hairdressing Its a nice Job you meet all sorts of people. You sometimes get people with long hair others with short hair some people come in to get their hair set other people want it cut or washed. Some people come to have it set for a wedding then it has to be done really nice. Others come in to have it set for a dinner party or a 21st birthday party or a wedding aniversary. You get a lot of different people in the shop.  Words: 258
