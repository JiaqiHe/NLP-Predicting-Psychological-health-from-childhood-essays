I AM 25 YEARS OLD AND I AM A LIBRAIN I CAME OUT OF LIBRAIE SCHOOL NOT ALL THAT LONG AGO. I WORK IN A LIBRARE AND I FIND I VERY INTERESTING WHEN I AM AT HOME I LIKE COOKING AND DRESS-MAKING. I OFTEN MAKE CLOTHES FORMYSELF AND OTHER MENBERS OF MY FAMILY. I WOULD LIKE TO WRITE A BOOK ONE DAY A MYSTER SORYE FOR CHILDREN I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO WRITE A FUNNY BOOK. I LEARN HOW TO KNOW WHAT AURTHORS WROTE WHAT BOOKS. I LIKE DOING FOLK DANCING IN THE EVENINGS, BUT IN SPARE TIME I START WRITING BOOKS, AND TRY AND GET THEM PRINTED. I LIKE ENBRODING THING; TABLE CLOTHES, COVERS, AND SMALL CLOTHES. OFTEN WHEN I AM BORED I READ BOOKS TOO, BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL HELP WITH WRITING THEM. I LIKE; CLOTHES, BOOKS, ANIMALS AND FLOWERS AND A KEEP A PET CAT. MY GARDEN HAS MANY FLOWERS IN IT, BUT I LIKE ROSES, PANSYES, AND MARIGOLDS BEST OF ALL. I LIKE BIRDS TO COME INTO THE GARDEN SO EVERYDAY I GIVE THEM SOME BREAD OR SEED. I LIKE GOING TO BATH SOMETIMES TO SEE WHERE THE VOLCANO WATER COMES UP TO OR TO SEE THE ROMAN THINGS THATS ARE THERE.
I LIKE SWIMMING IN THE SUMMER IN ANY SPARE TIME THAT I HAVE BUT I ONLY DO THIS WHEN THE WEATHER IS VERY HOT SO I DON'T GO WHEN DAYS ARE VERY COLD SOMETIMES I GO TO OTHER LIBRAYS AND SEE WHAT ITS LIKE THERE THEN I GO BACK TO THE ONE WHERE I USALLY WORK. BEFORE I WENT TO LIBRAE SCHOOL I HAD TO GET SOME O'LEVELS AND A'LEVELS I HAD TO GET ONE IN ENGLISH.  Words: 283
