I have a very exciting life and I have no dayly routine. I am a doctor, in my spare time I like to play golf and read books. I own a medium sized house and about 1/2 acre of grownd. I also have a surgury and car. I have 3 children and a wife. There are 2 boys and 1 girl. Also living with me is my mother. I hardley ever have any spare time because I am usellay in the surgury or out on my rounds. I like my work. Somtimes I help to operations in the hospital. In the night I sometimes have to get up to go and see a patienet. I have only just become a dotor and have only started in the surgury for 2 months.  Words: 131
