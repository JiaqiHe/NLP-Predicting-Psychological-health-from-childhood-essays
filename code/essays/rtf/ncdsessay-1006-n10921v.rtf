I am getting old now and small circles* apear in my hand. My mane interest is engines because they are so fantastic. I have got a job in a I.C.L. factory which is a big company on June the 20th I was 26 and I married. I live in a sem*i detached house with a long back garden. All ready we have had a telephone put in and it rings about every one hour. We live on Jackmans estate and it is about a mile to the town center. My wife was cross every day because I brought mud in after I had done my gardening. I do not work on suday because it is my day of work on a sunday I take my son david who is nine, fishing in at ickford. Not long ago I became a member of the town band and I play the drum which is quite hard. on every saturday night I go to the foot ball ground and watch the match as it goes on though the night.
