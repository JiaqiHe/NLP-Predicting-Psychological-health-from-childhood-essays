When I am seventeen I am going to join the marines and if I like it I will stay on till I'm twenty-five. When I come out I will go on to an aggricultural collage and become a farmer If I do become a farmer I will have a dog and breed hamsters in my spare time. I may also breed mice but they are more dificult because thier breeding is difficult to control.
I will have a studio for painting and drawing in my house and would send alot of cartoons to magazines. I would like my farm in Devon because it is near to the sea. I would like to have a small laboratory in my house to do a few small experiments in when I was not working because I like chemistry. In my farm I will keep animals more than grow grain and fruit Etc. I will not get married untill I have realy established my farm and have got enough money to keep a wife. If I do not become A farmer I would like to be a comedian and I would still have a dog and breed hamsters.  Words: 193
