I am a hairdresser I am married and have one child. I am interested in quit a few things I like going to parties where they have a disceteuqe on. I take an interest in my home I like to keep it tidy and up to date. I buy lost of ornaments especially glass ones for my house but I dont like it to be too overcrowded with them. At work I have my own little shop and I get alot of customes. On Saturday its all hussle and bussle but any other day it isnt to bad. My child is five years old and has started school. I always like to keep her neatly dressed I like to give her as much as I can but not as much that it will spoil her. When she can go on school trips I shall give her this oppertunity while she has got a chance. I want her to go anyway so she can see what the country side and the other beautiful things in this world are.  Words: 177
