"May 8th 1969          I am a boat maker I tried to get a job of making sailing boats. But first I had to learn how to make them. I went to a school where they made boats. The said he was very pleased to have me. First he showed me round the school. Then he said ""He is where you make the boats"". He showed me how to make a wooden boat. It took several weeks to make. Then he showed me how to make a fibre class boat. It didnt take as long to make it as the wooden boat because we had bang nails into a wood one. For a fibre glass boat you have to get a mould. We just put the fibre glass in it and wated till it set hard. When it was finished we put it in the river near by. It floated alright I had a go at making one. It took a little longer to make it because I wasnt an expert like the man. But I finished it. Then the man helped me put it in the water. A few weeks later I left the school and went to a boatyard on the broads. I got a job at making sailing boats. Now I am 25 and I have a good job at making sailing boats."  Words: 225
