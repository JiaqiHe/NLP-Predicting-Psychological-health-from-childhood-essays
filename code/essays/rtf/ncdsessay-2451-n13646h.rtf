I arrived home at five o'clock to pack my belongings and to fix myself some tea. The boss of [company name] Ltd. had told me to supervise a factory in Germany where they had made a new type of rubber. I was to carry out tests on it and to see if it had any signigciance.
I was working in a Industrial rescearch factory in Birmingham. I am not married and I live in a small house on the outskirts of the city. I watch football matches occaisonaly.
I travelled all over the world for my firm so the trip which I'm going to go on does not suprise me in the least. My expenses will be all paid for by the firm and I'm going to leave in a few days.
I took advantage of the few days I had off to get out and visit a few friends and my parents whom I'm very fond of.
The job at which I work at is very satisfactory as I enjoy my work and my salary is good. I have quite a sum in the bank which I have put aside and with the intrest it will all biuld up.  Words: 196
