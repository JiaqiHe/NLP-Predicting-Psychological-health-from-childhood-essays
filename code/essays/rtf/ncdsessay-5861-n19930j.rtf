I am now 25 years old, and I still go to university. I have been studying bioliogy for I* want to be an ornithologist. When I go home I usually read the paper and see whats going on in the world. I look at the television if there is anything interesting on. In my spare time I go for trips bird watching. I live in a cottage on my own in the country. I have a handy motor scooter for knocking about on. The university is just up the road from my house. I have'nt got a job yet but I go and help on a farm and get about 10s a week. At night I study some books which I borrowed from the university. They are books on bioligy. At the moment I am studying the anatomy of a bird. In the morning I check the bird boxes I have built, Then I get my thing's together tie them to my scooter and go back to the university. I have great fun there, at break we play football, and I have a walk along the river. and watch the swans. St night we have a drink and if you want, something to eat. I just have a drink go upstairs to the dormitory and get into bed. Ready for the morning ahead.  Words: 223
