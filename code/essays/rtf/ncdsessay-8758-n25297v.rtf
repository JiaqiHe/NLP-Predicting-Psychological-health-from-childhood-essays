It was my 25th birthday and I was feeling very proud with the way I was geting on in life . I was now teaching at a primary school part -time Monday - wednesday I liked teaching very much and it was a pleasure to know such nice children and to come home to a lovely tea . When I had spare time I had usually read books about History and I hardly ever read any other kind of book . On Saturdays I just helped tidy up the house and afterwards got grannys shopping for her. and stayed with her till tea-time On Thursday and Fridays I just hung about the house not knowing what to do . But if was no Monday and I had to go to the school. I was off school next day as I had to go to the college to do some studing for next day I was taking history and geography . I was doing the history of Mary Queen of Scots so it was quite easy as I knew a lot about her I had to look up quite a number of books which was no so easy as it was such a big library . One day as I was going to school I met an old friend of mine and I spent so long talking to her I was 15 minutes late and I got a ti*king off from the headmaster. at the end of the day I felt very tired so I went to bed straight after ten. It was now Thursday and I had arranged to go to the college to give a lesson to about 100 new students . It was very tiring and it took quite a time to explain what a teachers life would be like so by 5 o'clock I was very tired and had a sore head and a sore throat so I went to bed straight after the Stanley Baxter show which ended at 8 o'clock next day I it was one of my days off so I went to the pictures with one of my college friends it was a very good film so we went again in the afternoon and afterwards went to the baths the 6.30 pm to 7.45pm session . The following day was Sunday and I was also a Sunday school teacher so I had to leave the house at 10.30 a m the rest of the day I just went on studing . the history of Mary Queen of Scots. Many years later I desided to give up teaching and just go on studing so i gave up teaching and it was there I ended my days of teaching  Words: 454
