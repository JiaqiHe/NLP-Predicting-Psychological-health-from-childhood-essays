At the age of 25 I think I'd lead a happy life I'd be an enginear I'd have a good pay a nice place to live in. I might keep a few pets if I keep on liking animals like I do now. I dont think I'd be married though. Im not sure where I'd live because there are so many places that I havent been to but I'd make sure its nice. I dont think that I'd have time for many hobies realy because I'd be bringing things from work to do at home. I'd definately have a car to come to and fro from work I think if would be a small sports car.  Words: 116
