I am living in an old Farm house where I take people out for rides on the horses I have about ten horses. and about thirty ace** I have two golden Laborador dogs and six kittens two cats. I get up at six every morning get bre**fast feed the horses groom them then get them tacked up for nine when people start to come I take them for about an hour and a half then we go back to the feild near the house and we do some jummping. Then I take another five people. 
     When you look out of the windows of the house you can see for miles on the horizen are some lovely grassy hills. I have told some of the riders that we will go for a picnic there in three days time. I am going home to see my parents at the week end they like in **** and I live in surrey. I am going by car I have a blue mini which I was given for my nintenth* birthday I can now drive quite well.  Words: 183
