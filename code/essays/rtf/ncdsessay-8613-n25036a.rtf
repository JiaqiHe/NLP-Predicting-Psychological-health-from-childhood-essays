I work in a riding school teaching for exams. I have got my own pony called (name) he is 10 years old and is 132hh high. I have past nearly all my exams to own a riding school, and have one more to pass.
This one I am taking today. You have to do a cross country and a showing class. It is time to start I tached (name) up and went to the start and got my number which is 33.
At 4 o'clock we started and were allowed an hour to complete the course. The first jump was a brush and rails and about 20 yds after that was a stream with a 2ft high rail in front. Then there was a dull old wall and then a river to cross. It doesnt sound very long but it took me 45 minutes to get round. 
I came back with full marks to get round before anyone else did.
I took (name) back to the stables and gave him a feed or oats, boan and pony nuts. After I had fed him I went back to the house and changed. I put on my nylon jodpurs my white shirt black haching jacket and long black boats and a yellow tie. 
My number was 80. The course was consisting of parrald bars, hogs back, a 7ft wall, a water jump. a treble and double.
Luckily I passed that and was able to own stables. After that I had 12 horses and 6 ponies and had quite a good little trade, And that is my life horses.  Words: 262
