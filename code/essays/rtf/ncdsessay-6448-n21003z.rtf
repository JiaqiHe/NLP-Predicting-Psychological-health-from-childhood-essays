----------------------
I lead an ordinary kind of life. I am married and have a little girl of one year old. I do not go to work, but when my daughter is old enough to go to schoolI will go to college, and hope to become an infant teacher. 
     I am very interested in drawing but I don't think I am good enough to become an artist at all. At home I would be an ordinary house-wife and do the cooking, cleaning and shopping. e.t.c.until my daughter is old enough to go to school I will probably look after other people's children so there mother can go to work and so I can earn some money.
