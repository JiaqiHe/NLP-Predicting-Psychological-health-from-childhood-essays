I am 25 years old. I am married* I have no children. I look after the house every day. In my spear time I read books I would have a cup of tea and some biscuits every morning at 11'o'clock. Then I would go up stairs and make the bed. Then sweep up, and then I would read books in the afternoon after I've had dinner and washed up. Then about hald past four I would get my husbands dinner ready And when he's finished his dinner and I've washed up I would see whats on television and if there's something I like on I would watch it. I live in a house it has 4 Bedrooms a bathroom a front room, living room, and a kitchen. I have a garden at the back and front of the house and a back yard.  Words: 143
