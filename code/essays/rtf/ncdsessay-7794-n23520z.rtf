I have just passed my exams for 1st officer. I will be on a passenger cruiser on the ship Uganda. We will leave Southampton at 09.00 for India, where we will stay for 21 days and then return to England. My interests are finding girls, studying about being a second officer and at night I would go to parties, dances etc. I sometimes enjoy my sleep if the see is calm or if its rough I never sleep. Sometimes I am on night duty. sometimes on day duty. If I have a chance I have a swim in the pool. When we get to India. I explore some of it and go inside the museums. But when I am at Southampton I have to vacume my house cook dinner. eat it, Wash up Wipe up and put away the cutlery and crockery. Then I visit all my relations, mum and dad first they will be in their seventies. Then my cousins Aunts and uncles. I give mym and Dad a fiver each to spend. to buy what they want. Grand* parents two pound each or a fiver between them. And my cousins Aunts and Uncles One pound each. Then buy the food. I might get married, all depends what the girls are like. Then if I become a 2ndofficer I will probably stay on the ships until I am Captain on a ship When I am about fifty and still a Captain I will ocme off the cruisers and buy a sjop and start getting more money.
