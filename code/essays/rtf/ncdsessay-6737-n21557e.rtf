I am 25 and I would like to work in a postoffice. i would like to have 2 babys, a boy and and girl. I would call the boy Micheal, and the girl Wendy Jane. When I'd had the babys I wouldn't work any more, I'd let my husband work farme I'd cook his meals. and on Fridays It would my night out. I would like to go out far meals and somtimes dancing. I would look for a decent baby-sitter and give them ten-shillings in return. Then on Tuesday I'd like my husband to bring me a box of chocalates. He would have to help me wash up and clean the house, and when we have enough money I would bye a car, and on saturdays we would go shopping. I wouldn't smoke a lot of ciggarettes.  Words: 138
