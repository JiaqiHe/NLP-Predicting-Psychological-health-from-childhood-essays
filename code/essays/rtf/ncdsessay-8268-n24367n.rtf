----------------------
I am 25 years old and I am a pilot of the Roayl Air Force and I have only just started to be a pilot when I'm on holidays I paint with my oil paints I don't do much painting because I don't have much time. 
I like being a pilot and I think it is very good and also very interesting too.
If I would not have been fit to be a pilot I would be a navigator.
I am not married and I will not get married euther, because I do not want to get troubled for all my life, so I will just stay alone and happy with my mother and sister.  Words: 113
