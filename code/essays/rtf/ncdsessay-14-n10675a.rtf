If I was 25 years old I might be working and studing on being a policeman. At first I would have a second hand car for a few years, and after a while get a bigger car if I had the money. My interests at home would be a referee at a small football match and go to a club which played table tennis. My life I would be leading would be ordinary way of life I would live in the country. I would have a small garden and I would have a very big dog proberly a St Bernard. My work at the age of 25 would be quiet studied at, I would not work in an office I would do a job outside. I might get married but proberly not, My home intrest would be to go to as many football matches as I can and collect rosetts of teams. I might keep a yacht or a boat and do a lot of sailing.
