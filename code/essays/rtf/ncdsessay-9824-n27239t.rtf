The work I do is hair dressing I leve home at 8 and I return home at 8. The work I do in between is practicing on my little sister. To days date is 5th of march and one of my friends invited me to a party it was very enjouable I was able to stay untill 12 midnight. Over the week end I like to invit a fue friends and play table tenis and when we were completely warmed up we would go in for a swim. I was very interested in sport I watch most sport on television but like to go out to watch it real live or a friends house. I thought I was leading a good life but I said I mus go out moor. The first time I went out moor I met lots of people and got to know them moor. Soon I managed to see them every saturday and go out for long rides. But it soon ended they had to moove.
