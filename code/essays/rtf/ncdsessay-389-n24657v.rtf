I would like to join the merchant navey[.] I would like to be a Captain abord the Ship. If I join then Navey I am going to Sail all round the world. These are a few of the places I would like to go Astralia, German and Amrica. At nights when our Ship has docked I will go with the freinds I have made and have a drink. When we have docked where I live. I will go out with my wife. As I will get married at twenty one years of age. Sometimes I will take her to the pictures. Others I will take dancing. But sometimes we will just stay in by the fire watching the teley. When my father was younger he was in the navey. He Said it was very good. He also told me you get more money in the Merchante navey than you do in the Royle navey. I want to be in charge of the Ship which Im on so my children Can be Proud. After about ten years in the merchant navey I will leave and do something elss [else]. Like waiter[.] I think I would like to get all dressed up and be a day and night time waiter who severs meals. Bring the food in the people oredered on trays with one hand. I think that if I be came a waiter I would like to wiat [wait] in a hotel like the white horse. I have been in the white horse and I think that it is very posh. All the waiters are all poshley dress-ed. Their Shoes all polished. But I like the tie and coat best of all.  Words: 281
