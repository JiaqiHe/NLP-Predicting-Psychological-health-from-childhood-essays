I am leading a good life and I meet many people. My job is good and happy. My interests are fishing and cooking which I've liked since I was 10 years old. My home life is enjoyable with my wife and two children. Every Sunday I have my mother and father out for tea. My job as a cook is worth while for I travle alot and like I said before I meet a lot people. My wife says that I'am a sheaf, so she leaves me to cook the Sunday jiont. My children like to play with my racing track just like I used to. In my spare time I go fishing and relax. My wife is a housewife and she sometimes helps at the hairdressers.  Words: 127
