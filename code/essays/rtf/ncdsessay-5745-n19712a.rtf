"      I have a wife and she is going to have a baby. My job is as a drop forger a person who deals in making spanners and train axles, anything to do with tools. I work in an office which look down on the great big hammer's which stamp out the tools. The workers knock off at five, and I do half an hour later after inspecting the fan belt which drives the machinary, pack my ""homework"" as I call it and drive home in my mini. I am interested in flowers and in hothouse plants and in my spare time our next door neighbour and I are building a green-house. 
      Our back garden backs on to the [golf course] in which I meet a few friends and have a game of golf. If you win you get sixpence from every player. 
      I was down to my last sixpence when I won the next hole, I collected two shillings that go. On our lawn i made a putting green by making some holes in the grass and putting some plastic flower pots in them.
      I hope to be promoted soon because my sister and mother are retiring. My sister is good at biology and she is going to take that up and have more training. We had to rent a house in Wales and to take our children (when they are grown) and eventually buy one."  Words: 239
