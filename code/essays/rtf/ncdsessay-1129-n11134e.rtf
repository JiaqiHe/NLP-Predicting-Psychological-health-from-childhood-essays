When I am twenty five I would like to be a teacher. I would like to teach nursery or infant children. 
     If I do not get into a teachers training college I would like to by a phisiotheropist with young children. 
     As hobbies I would like to have a pony of my own as I could ride every evening. If I could not afford a horse. I would go to some stables. I also like collecting stamps from all over the world. Reading is another of my hobbies I especialy like reading ghost stories mystery stories, adventure stories and a number of other stories
     If I could not be a phisiotheropist or a teacher I would like to get married to a farmer. I would feed the hens. help milk the cows* and many other things I would like to have a daughter and a son or any children. I would teach how to ride, milk cows and other things. I would like to paint farm scenes and country scenes. 
     Every year I would try to go abroad to hot countries like Spain. Italy, Jugaslavia and Turkey. I would also like to visit Poland where my father came from. 
     I suppose when I am twenty five I will have a different point of view to what I want to do.  Words: 224
