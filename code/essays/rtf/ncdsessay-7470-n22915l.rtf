----------------------
I live in a house, near London. I am married and have got 2 children, a boy and a girl. The boy is a toddler and the girl is 6 months old. I used to work as an actress, but because I was married, and had become a housewife, a wife, and nearly a mother I had to give it up. I may act in a few plays, when my children are older. The boys name is [name], and the girls name is [name]. My hobbie's, are knitting and sewing, and sometimes, when we go to see my parents up north, I go fell-walking. In some of the plays I have acted in, we went abroad to perform. I have been, to Spain, Switzerland, and France. I flew to Spain, in a Concorde. I had never flown in one before, and it was very comfortable. I once acted in Hamlet, and it was very difficult, to obtain the right material, as we wear paper dresses now.  Words: 166
