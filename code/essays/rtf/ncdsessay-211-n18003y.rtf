When I am twentyfive I think the world will be all changed, because space men would have landed on the moon. And they would be finding out if anywon, or anything was on the moon. I think I would be married at that time and have four children. I would be interested on being a doctor but when I am older! I would like to have a big house with a lovely garden and lots of flowers. I would like to go to university and study to be a doctor, because I like curing people, and you get plenty of money. I will be playing and you get plenty of money. I will be playing football, or be at the beach with my family. When we have our holiday, I would like a sunny Country like Italy. If I got to university I would not like to share a flat with a friend, because I would be home to much. The world would be changed also because the decimal currency would be out, and more old towns would be demolished, and more modern houses, lampposts, roads, and other buildings would be in its place. There would be [illegible] cars, trains, buses, that would take [illegible] we wanted to go faster. And who knows [illegible] might be a care for Cantser. But [illegible] thing it will be a new and better world than before.  Words: 233
