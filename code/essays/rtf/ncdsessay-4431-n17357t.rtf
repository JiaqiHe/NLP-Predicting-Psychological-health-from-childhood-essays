When I grow up I shall be a foot-baller I shall play for West Bromwich Aiblon. I shall start football at the age of 24 1/2 I shall not get marriad because I'll stay home and help my mother I started foot when I was 7 years old at the age 10 I played with Deizes Rd we got the the semie finals. I would clean up for my mum I would give her half the share of money I would get.
I would come home evry luch time to see her. In the weeks exserpt saterdays I would have another Job which would be painting peoples houses and painting schools. One day a week I would clean my car and will stop foot-ball till I am about 34 but I shall carry on painting untill I am about 44 years I might get married when I grow up or I might not  Words: 152
