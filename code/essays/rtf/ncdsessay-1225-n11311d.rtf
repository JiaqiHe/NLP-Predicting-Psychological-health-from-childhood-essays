I am now 25 years old I have been marrid for 1 year. I am marrid to [name] who is a train driver. I go to evening classes to keep up with my neddlework. I met my husband at University. My husband left a few months before I did. I live in a flat near the centre of London. I do not go to work but stay at home and do housework I am very interested in needle work most  of the dresses I have got I made myself. I enjoy living in a flat. Sometimes it's a bit noisy but I always have friend's to talk to. I do most of my shopping on Friday because I can then go out Saturday and Sunday. If I don't go out on Saturday either do housework or wash my car. When I go shopping I go in my car. I have got a blue mini.
      Our flat is quite small but it is big enough for two of us. We sometimes have our friends to tea. I sometimes baby sit for my next door neighbor. The babys name is [name]. Sometimes she is a menace other times she is very sweet On Thursday's I sometimes take her over the park and we have a picnic. She loves going on the swings and the horse. I take her on the baby slide which she likes also. On Wednesday I go to the library to read for a while then I go home and cook the tea. By the time I have washed up the tea things we sit down a look at the television. About 9.30 I make supper after that we go to bed.  Words: 283
