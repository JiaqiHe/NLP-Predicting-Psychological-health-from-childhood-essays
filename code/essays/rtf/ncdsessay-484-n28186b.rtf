Now I am 25 year old I see what my mother and father meant When I was small that life was difficulte when grown up and I reziles it now but I lead a very interesting life now. In 2 year time I will leave College and get a job as a shorthand tyipps I live in a flat in East London and I have a very happy life. Two of my inerests is making dresses and horse riding but I do not have toomuch time to go down to the country and go horseriding but i do make all my know dresses. my work at the college is a very interesting one I work a 4 day week and thenstudy at home. Saturday nights are the beast because I go to ballroom danceing lessons. I can play the piano and recorder. but I would sooner be with mum and dad at home by a lovely big coal fire but instead I have to sit by a gas fire and study.  Words: 171
