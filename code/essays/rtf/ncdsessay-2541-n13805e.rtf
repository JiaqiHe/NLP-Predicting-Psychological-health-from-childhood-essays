I am now 25 and I have a good job in an aircraft factory. I take part in put in the engines of the aircraft. After I have finished work I go to the local pub about half a mile away from here. I have a few pints of beer, then go home for a late night tea, of sausages and chips. In my spare-time I go for walks in the counrty with my camera to take counrty scenes, or go fishing in the River Ouse. Sometimes I go camping in a forest or wood, or I will do some gardening or planting seed in some boxes in the greenhouse. During the dark night I look at the stars and universe sometimes I see shooting stars and meteorites hitting the surface of the moon and making big craters.  Words: 138
