At present I am working as an assistant in a big supermarket and am looking for a better job. I am newly married to a twenty-three year old girl from (place). I was just married five months ago and we are staying in (place).
A few months later I was offered a job at a (place) linen factory and accepted it. Later I also became a Boys Brigade officer. The boys were going to camp so I took my wife with me as it would be a nice break for her. A year later we had a baby girl and after some time we decided to call her (name). I am sitll keeping up with my job at the linenfactory. I have now been at it for two and a half years. Four months later we had two twins. They were boys so we decided to call them (name) and (name).
We decided the walls needed painting so we were very busy preparing for the painter to start work. I later change my job after being at it for three years. I am now working with another firm in (place). One saturday we decided to go to (place) for the day as we have relations staying there.
We went to the castle to see the crown jewels. *** was a marvellous view looking down. On the city there was a telescope at the top so we could look through it.
I am leading a very happy life and enjoy it very much.  Words: 248
