"I live in (place) America , and my job is a policeman. American policemen have to be armed because thieves and murdurers are armed too. My beat is (place) .
I can recall one day I was patrolling up and down High street in the patrol car with my mate (name) when the (bank) Bank alarm bell went, I swung the wheel round into (place) . There I saw the two bankrobbers they had a women driving the car for them when one of the bankrobbers shouted ""Don't follow us or she gets a lead lead!"" they then darted into (place) and drove out of sight. I said to (name) ""We must make roadblocks and tell the chief about this. ""After all the roadblocks were made we told the chief all the information . The car was a black sedan registration number (car registration number) .
About 8 hours later this same car was found in a river going through a dump the woman was also found with three bullet holes in her stomach. Later a doctor looked her over but she was dead . A fortnight later the two same bankrobbers were caught in trying to steal a car . They were taken to prison and later went to court. The jury judged guilty and got solitary confinement . But hardly anything goes on like that now . And thank-goodness I only have to break-up a fight with some small boys."  Words: 240
