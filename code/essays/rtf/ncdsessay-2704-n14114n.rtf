I am leading a very happy life and I am interested in swimming, dancing and stamp collecting. I have a very nice home and when I come home from work I like to sit and read. I work in an English shipyard which has produced many famous ships. One of them the honourable ship H.M.S. Boystown which was named after a town in America help Britain to win their battle against Germany. I like working there because the man who owns it shows us pictures of some of the ships built there.  Words: 92
