When I am 25 years old I would like to be a nurse. My hobbies would be horse riding, hockey and tennis. I would live in a flat with a friend. My work would consist of giving help to sick people, help in preparing operations and keeping the medicine cupboards in order. I would like to be in the childrens ward because I like children I would often read or study in the evenings and in my spare time I would somtimes go to watch hockey or tennis matches I would like to live in a flat in London, and I would like to work in a famous hospital in the city centre. My uniform would be quite long as it has to be eighteen inches from the ground, and I am not very tall. My favourite patients would be little children with desieses like tonsetilus or apendicitus. I would often attend lectures about the blood or parts of the bidy, these I would not like very much because I think nearly all proffesors are boring. My ordinary clothes would be quite modern but not too short. I would wear make up but I would not wear it thick. Often I would be on night duty and leep the log books in order.  Words: 213
