"I am leading a very normal life at the moment. When I left University at the age of twenty-one I imedietly went searching for a job. I could not find a job that really suited me. I was very disapointed for I had always dreamed of having job like being a computer programmer or being a test pilot, and what do I end up as being? a plummers mate. Some step down from a test pilot! That was only my first job though. Even though I was occupied with my pluming job I was still searching for a much better job. At last I saw it a break that I had been waiting for for months. I saw an advert in the paper for a man to keep the files in order of a Mr. [name] employment ajency. The part of the advert that made my mind up was the part at the bottom in bracets which read ""Good pay"". I imedietly aplied and a few days later I recived a letter. I fumbled to open it and when I finally did get it open I let out a sigh of relif for I had been excepted. Since then I have been in the same old rotine. That is - get up, have breakfast, go to the office, come home, have tea, watch television and go to bed. That has been happening for three years and I think that it will go on for another few years."  Words: 247
