I think that i will be nearly married when i am 25. But before that I will think I would probably have a job in Switzerland as the person in charge of the children`s parties , in a hotel I would arrange the picnic lunches and **** , but I would mostly be organising the children 's half. 
I would like to have quite a lot of free time for ski-ing, and when i am ne* there I would like to be able to have a chance to have a tour of the towns and villages, around the hotel and get to know the place.
I think that Iwould have a little car or bycicle, and I would live in the part of Switzerland where they talk french as I prefer French to German. 
I would to be able to come home fairly often and not stick at the same job all the time but have lots of jobs.
I think I would like to have a flower shop in somewhere like (town) (England) and arrange flowers for people. I would like to have my house in the shop.
By the time I am 26 I think I will be married by then.
*n my leave I would like to be able to ride and foxhunt As I could ride one of my parents horses , and I would like to be able to keep a falcon or hawk at home and go hawking , as I enjoy it very much.  Words: 247
