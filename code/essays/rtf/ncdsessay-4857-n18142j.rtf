My Name is [name] I work at [university] I rent a flat near the collage at ten pounds a week and I walk to the Lectures each day. My main interest is to become a chemist so that I can take over my granfathers Business in [town] [county] when he dies. I have to attend 5 Lectures each day. My flat is very compact, I have two rooms one room is for sleeping and the other is for cooking and eating. In the corner of the kitchen is a little gas stove next to that is a wash basin and draining board on the other side of the cooker is a fridge it is only a very small one it is like the ones which chemists use to keep their drugs cool. Infront of the cooker is a small round table and one chair. at the other side of the room there is a little attic which the landlady lets me use for my chemical experiments. Next year I am taking a degree in General scince but this year I am taking a degree in chemitry.  Words: 186
