When i am twenty five i hope to play football for either Leeds, Spurs, Chealsea or Manchester City and if i do play for one of these clubs i hope i am captain and top goalscorer and my favorite posision is left half, but my dream is to go to Wembly stadium and win the F.A.CUP and the next year we hope to retain it and after that win the European cup. And when i am twenty six i hope to be in the England team and win the World cup. When i retire from football i want to own a shop and sell sweets, ice cream, stamps and food and if i can't be a shopkeeper i would like to be an architect and desin all sorts of buildings for instance houses, flats, bungalows and sky-scrapers
But if i cannot be an architect i might work part time in a morning and in the afternoon i would like to be a gardener.  Words: 162
