If I can save enough money I am thinking on goind abroad to Australia, I will stay there for quite a long time and then I might go back to Britain. If I have any children I will call the girl [female name] [female name] or [female name] [female name] and the boy I will call [male name] [male name] or [male name] [male name]. When I get a place to live in I should like to have a bungalow or a cottage, I will try to get a nice sized garden with it. I should like to live somewhere near a town. I will grow my own vegetables and a few trees for us to eat. I do not know what kind of job I will have yet. I do not want to get a bungalow with electric heating in it, because I do not like it very much.  Words: 150
