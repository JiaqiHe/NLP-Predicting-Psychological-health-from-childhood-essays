"I am 25 years old and own a riding school, It is easy work as I have 10 stable girls to help me. I get up at six oclock in the morning and do the housework, then at half past six my husband and I have breakfast. By seven oclock most of the stable girls are here, so they have a cup of tea and go out to clean the tack, then I'd say. ""Right [name] tack up Banha, [name] do fred, and so on. Soon riders come for their rides so I put them on the ponies most suited* and we set out to the schooling paddock, many riders come and so by the end of the day I have made quite a profit, so im satisfied with my job."
