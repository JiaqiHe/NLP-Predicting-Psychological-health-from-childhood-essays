At 25 yrs of age I would become or shall I say try to become a football player, but knowing that I wouldn't I most probably will become an engineer. I would get married, and camp in the South of France for holidays. I would work hard and earn enough money to keep a family going. I would join a car company, like Lotus. I would try and get to the place. where engines are involved. At home I would still watch television, play the guitar and most of all I would give my children good education, I would always help them in difficulties and if they ever wanted any help with anything I would help. I would never ever dream of going on one of those stupid strikes - less working hours same pay. It is ridiculous, but if I get into a decent firm I'm pretty sure there won't be any strikes. I would try and get as many friends as I could and always be co-operative with everyone. The most important thing is - if ever your father or mother died to go to their funeral, but really if I was to split my life up 60% would go towards my children 30% for work and 10% for pleasure. Another thing I would never dream of getting intoxicated. I would try to lead a good life and when I die I hope I will go to heaven, because every Sunday I would go to church.  Words: 248
