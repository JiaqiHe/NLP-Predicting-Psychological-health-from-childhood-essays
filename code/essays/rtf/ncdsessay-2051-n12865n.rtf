"I woke up one morning in my fresh, clean, bright new house. As I briskly walked down the stairs I remembered that it was my birthday, on entering the brakefast room I saw a large parcel wrapped in coloured paper. I bent over it, and there was a note on it saying ""To my darling husband,"" ripping it open I found enclosed in it two wheels for my 500 cc motor bike. Later that morning after brakefast there was a roar of an engine and my wife smiled. On following her out side I saw before me a gleaming Aston Martin D.B.5, out of it poped my dad as bright and frisking as ever. Then he said ""She's all yours"" I could hardly believ my ears I said ""What"" ""She's all yours"" he said, After saying a big thank you to him, I made him come in and have a cup of coffe. After we had finished we locked up the house went for a drive in the car; I went behind the wheel, so off we went for a drive. The green banks and hedges went wizzing by. When we finaly drove up the drive it was quite late, and we had supper strait away."  Words: 206
