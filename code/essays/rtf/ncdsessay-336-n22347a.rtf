My job is a being garage mechanic. I am married and my wife is expecting a baby. My working hours are forty hours, in a five day week. I am lucky being a garage mechanic as I can do my own repairs on my car. I only have to take it to the garage when big damage is done to the car. My wife works at a chemists shop but will have to give the job up to look after the baby. I am intrested in wildlife and go to the local wildlife meeting which is every month. At home I make a lot of shelves and cupboards for our different recquirement. Also at home I help my wife cleaning the house. I go to church every Sunday. The church which I go to has a young minister who often plays the guitar. This I like, and also other modern ways of life, such as modern building. I think more money should be spent on povety and countries who are not in a very good postion in this world. I hope my child to be clever and not led a bad life, I will teach him all I know.
