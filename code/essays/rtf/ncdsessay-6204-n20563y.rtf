When I will be tewenty five it will be 1983. By then men would have landed on the moon and the Decimal money will be in use. I do not really now what I'll be My interests now is football, Reading and collecting old coins and I think those will be my interests when I grow up. But the thing I'd like to be when I'm 25 is a footballer playing for Manchester United and I then hope that George Best will be Manager. I I could captan Manchester United I would win the League Cup, Eares* Cup and the Championship. Also I would like a home in [city] with two children and a wife. In the week I would like to be a British Rail Lorry Driver going around [city]. In our school now we have no football team because there are not enough boys. In my work I would like to work five days and have Saturday off to play football and Sunday off. I would like to play for Wales also and be centre forwad and score a hat-rick against England.
