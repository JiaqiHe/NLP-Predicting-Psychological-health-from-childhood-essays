I would like to play football for Leeds united, in my spare time I would trian, running etc have shooting practis. In the week when I want playing football I would try and get a job in the police force. I would get a house near the sea side were it is warm. On nights I would patrol the street in my police uniform If I was lucky I would probaly stop a few house breakers. If I was realy lucky I would like to be a sargent and boss everybody about and have somebody to drive me about in a police car, and have a few more stripes put on and some badges I would still have the same navy blue coat, trousers and hat. I would play centre forward for Leeds United and score about 2 goals in each game I played and be the top goalscorer in the 1st division every season I woud score 50 goals altogether. We would go to Wembly and win the FA Cup and the inter citiys fairs Cup and the European Cup. I would retire at 42 years old but before I retied I would win some more cups and medals for the team.
