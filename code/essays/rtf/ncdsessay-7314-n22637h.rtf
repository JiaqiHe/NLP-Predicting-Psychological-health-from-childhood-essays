"The day I am twenty five, am I going to go out and try to find a job, I will look for what I always wanted to be, and what I learnt about how to do it, I am going to be an actor. And in my spare time I am going to go out to clubs and go to the pub. And try to find myself a wife. 
Then one day I would settle down and have children. One day when I was in Amercia for my holiday this pretty lady comes in to the garage, where I was working part time. And asked if she could have her car checked, and have new tyres put in, I said ""yes mam"" an imedity she went out I went straight on to the job. 
When I had the tyres i nand had her car checked I went up the garage and in to the office to see if I could find where she lived, after I had a good* look through all the books, I found it, she lives on a hill in a big house number 126 [street name].
When I was near it I saw it was a big red house with small windows. When I had* got out of her Mercury I parked it in a little green garage then I went up to the door and knocked on it and told her, her car was ready."  Words: 239
