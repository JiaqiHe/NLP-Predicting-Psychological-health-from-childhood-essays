I have just gone out of  college and I am now returning home. My interests are in teaching children. I am usually interested in how people live in there own ways. The body is an interesting thing and there is much to know about it. I think my home life was a boring one nothing interested me at all so I think I'll get married. My work for the time being was to be a teacher I have not yet married but I have got a boy-friend. He is a policeman who guides the traffic. I now want to marry so I get married to the policeman and get three children named [name] [name] and [name] they are all girls. I stop work but my husband goes on wth it. At the age of 38 my first daughter leaves me then a few years later the other two go. We have retired and soon will be Grandparents I am now told that my parents are dead I have a heart attack and then I was rushed into hospital I had a operation but after it they said that I was not going to llive much longer. So from ths time on I could go anywhere I wanted to die a happy death. I suddenly die in my sleep. I was buried and that was the end of me  Words: 228
