I would like to have a dress for every day of the week. I would like to send my children to a school were you have to pay I would like to send my boys to Rugby that is a good school. I would like by girls to go to dacing and acting. When I died I will leave all my money to my children if I have any I will writed a will for them. They will get half each. If I died before my husband i will have to give my money to him what I have in the bank. When I am old and my children get married I would like to live with one of my children when she is married. If my husband dieds before me and I am not old I would like to work in a bank that job is not very hard.  Words: 277
