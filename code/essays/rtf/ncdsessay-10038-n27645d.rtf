I am know twenty five and my job is an electricion. This is the kind of life I like to lead. I like this kind of job because you travel to other places like (place) and (place) . Another reason I like this job is that you get quite a lot of money. In this kind of job you find out more about the world . As an electricion you have to be very carful other wise you could get a shock and if the electricity goes through your hole body you could die. If you are an electricion and your are puting a socket into the wall you must put it in secure or it might cause a lot of damage. In the factory that I work you can see a lot of men waring masks to protect their eyes from little sparks when they are working .  Words: 149
