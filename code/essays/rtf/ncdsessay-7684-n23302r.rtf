I am 25 and I am the right back for Machester United football club. I am not married and I live with my parents. In my spare time I do some work in the garden. Now and then I like going out for a ride in my E'Type Jaguar. Sometimes I take my parents out for a ride. When I am not playing football I work in a Post Office. Sometimes I do a bit of stamp collecting. One day I hope I may play for England football team.  Words: 89
