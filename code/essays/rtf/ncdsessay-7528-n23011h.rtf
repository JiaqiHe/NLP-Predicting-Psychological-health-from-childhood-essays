I'm not quite sure what I would like to be but I find it diffacul to explain. I might be a hairdresses or a Mother or a part time worker. I like mucking* about with long hair*. I thing a hairdresser would be my job because I have wacth very carefully at hairdresser when I'm in the shop at how they it. If I had twin girls I would let their hair grow long, that will be if can't a get a job. I think if I marrid it will be to a to a tall handsone man whose rate* our good I and his job is good and I like it. If I work in a hairdresser I hope I get good money and the shop was not to for away*.  Words: 132
