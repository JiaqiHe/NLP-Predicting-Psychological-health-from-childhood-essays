When I am older I hope to train to be a teacher. So in that case I should have started teaching by the age of 20-23 (I am not sure how long I would have to train for teaching). I would try to make the subjects I teach as interesting as possible, because if the subject are made interesting then I hope that children would be so interested that they would like all subjects very much. I suppose I will still like reading as much as I do now (I like reading a lot). If I have any children I will reach them to swim at the age of 5 years, I hope that they will enjoy swimming as much as I do. I hope I shall live in the country. (I like to look out of the window and see the green trees, and yellow corn waving in the breeze). So if all these things happen, I should be very happy indeed.  Words: 163
