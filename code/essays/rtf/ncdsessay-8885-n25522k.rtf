----------------------
I am interested in animals and taking care of them. I am working as an short hand typist in a office. My job is quite interesting and I meet lots of people. I am married, nothing much is happening at home at the moment. I have a son who has started school yet, he is getting on well. My husband has an office job like me. Sometimes I am in vited to a party or dance which I enjoy.  Words: 79
