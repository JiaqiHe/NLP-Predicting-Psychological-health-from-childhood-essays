When I am twenty five I hope that I shall be in the police force. I shall still contiue on with my intrests and hobbies, and I will not smoke or drink. If I did get married I would like to settle down and live in country. When I do go to live in the country I would like to own some horses. I shall also have some other pets as I am fond of animals. If I did manage to get into the police force I would like to get into a high rank. When I do get to the age of twenty five I would like to own a car. If I ' went on holiday at that age I would like to go abroad. Some of my hobbies and intrests which I get bored with I shall leave out. If there was a club for people who are intrested in history I would join as I like history. If I ever had to leave the police foce at that age I would like to become a teacher. and teach mainly history. If I did live out in the country I would lead a normal home life and would not be fussy over meals or anything. And every morning I would take a walk over the countryside.  Words: 219
