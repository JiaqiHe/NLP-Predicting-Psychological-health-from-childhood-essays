I am 25 years old and I have just left a college. Today I am going to be interviewed in [xxxxxxx] for a job of dress making. I will propable have a few tests first because I understand that there are quite a few people aplieing for this job.  If I do'nt get this job I can go to another interview for a job in a shop as a cashier.  I am married to a manager of a print-ing ferm [firm]. I have no children. I disided to get a job because we need the extra money to keep up with the rising costs of tod-ay.  We live in a private house witch is just the right size for our needs.  I meet [met] my husband in college and it was like love at first sight. He is also 25 and is fond of horse riding, photography and mountanear-ing. He is also very interested in the way of life. My husband and I have often been on cruises and once we went on a cruise round the world.   My husband left college at the age of 22 and got a job of caretaker in a school but the school was demoleshed and all the staff lost their jobs including my husbands.   Then he got a job in a printing facto-ry and he worked himself up to the top. He has very good wages and we are both very lucky.  Words: 239
