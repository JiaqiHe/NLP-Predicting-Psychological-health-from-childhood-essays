I have just left the College to be a Cookery teacher the school is in the Contry with a lot of Country Children, it is a Secondary modern school. I am still living on at home with my parents. At nights I have to try to think of Something to do for the next cookery lesson. Every Wednesday night All the teachers have a meeting, here they Can tell each other about the children and there behavior. We have Collected enough money to take some of the school on an outing the chilldren helped to save money by raffeling tickets. every Saturday night I take mum and Dad to see some of the relations I take them in my Car it is a mini. My Brother is in the army he is on leave at the moment but he has to go back at the end of may. It is very hard work being A teacher because you have to look after quite alot of Children most nights I have a sore throat after shouting at the Children. Monday Tuday and Friday are my nights off these nights I go out with a boyfreind of mine he is a Canaidian and has a job as a Chuf at the [inn]. My father has a part time job he helps at the airport he writes letters to different people at other firms. My mother is just an ordinary house wife. That is all I have to say about my life as being a Cookery* teacher.  Words: 254
