"I am leading the life of a hairdress. One day a lady comes in and ask if she can have apointmed for ""Monday 23rd at 10 o'clock"". I open the book and sheif I can fit it in but all Monday is full up so I ask if it will be all right Thursday 26th at 10 o'clock. Then it was time for me to go home and all the rest of the hairdress I lock the door, and then I got in my car and went home. Then when I got home I change, and then got my horse things and get it's food. When I get home I change and I then got my supper and I went to bed. In the morning I got up and I then dress and had my breakfast*, and I lock up the house I made sure all the windows were shut and I went off to the hairdress, and when I got there some people were waiting I unlock the door, and went inside the other hairdress were not here but they would be here soon. I start the day, somebody was going to have a set first I washed her hair I then pinned it up and then put it under the dry then I finish that day."  Words: 218
