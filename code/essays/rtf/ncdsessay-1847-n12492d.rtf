----------------------
I have 1 girl of two years old. I got married when I was 21. I live in a medium sized house which I live to keep tidy. I am a secretary to an important business man. My husband is a managing director to a big firm. my mum and dad live round the corner from and my mother-in-law and father-in-law live about a mile away. My husband's job sometimes takes him away from us for a few days so my daughter sleeps with me. My mum looks after my daughter when I am at work. Every Friday I take my daughter to the town and buy her a toy or some sweets. I make most of her clothes. My husband likes to play with my daughter but he intends to get a bit rough and she normally ends up crying. I come home from work at half past twelve and have my dinner then at two o'clock. And I come home again at 5 o'clock. Every year I go on a two week holiday. Once I went abroad to Italy. My honeymoon was in Spain.  Words: 186
