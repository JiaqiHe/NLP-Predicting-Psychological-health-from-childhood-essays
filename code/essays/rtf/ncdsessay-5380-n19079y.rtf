I am a blacksmith, I am married but I have know children on saterdays my wife and I go to the cinama every week, on sunday we go to church and then we go on a picnike on the beach.
In my work are 106 men working we make gates, fire-escapes, eney thing out of rote-ion.
In my spare time I go to a golf club but if it is raining I go swiming in indoor swimming pools. 
When I come home from work I go for a walk or I go for a ride in my little car. I have got a dog and I sumtimes I take him.  Words: 108
