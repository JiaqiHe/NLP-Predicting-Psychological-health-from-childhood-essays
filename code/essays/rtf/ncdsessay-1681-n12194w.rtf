I have been playing goal-keeper for Hull City for* six years now and am un-married (still). at home my main interests are keeping fit, making models and watching soccer programes on T.V. My home life is pretty dreairy but I try to enjoy myself as much as I can but I usually end up playing records and jumping all-over the place pretending I'm playing in goal (and getting a few bruses).
