I am 25 and training to become a teacher, the life I am leading is quite hard and during the afternoon I do some extra work. I own a little flat and i have a few intrests like having a few children from the block of flats where I live to teach a few lessons to. I do my own cooking and other things and sometimes I go to a theater when I have a spare day. On Monday afternoon I go to a Brownie hall where I am a Tawny Owl, the Brownies are very helpful when the meeting draws to an end in helping me put the things away for the next week. The life I lead is quite simple but the people who live opposite me are very helpful and help in any way. I decorate the flat when it needs it during the spring. I like growing plants of my own in tiny pots which I transplant if they grow to big for the pot. Some very tiny plants I keep on a window sill, but when I'm a bit bored I do experiments in slicing plants through the middle very carefully. Some of things I do which turn out well I preserve and put in a big glass cabinet in the drawing room. I like going to museums and when I want somewhere to go I would take a pad of paper and some pencils to a museum and copy some pictures. Every summer I usually go to Kew Gardens or Richmond to see the plants in the hot houses and have a quiet stroll around the gardens. The dream I have in my mind is to pass my exams and become a teacher however long it took me.  Words: 294
