I would just about be getting married and my job would be a computer engineer for I.C.T. I would have a car and it would be a Capri. On a Saturday afternoon I would go to a football match and on a Sunday I would go to my old home to see my mum and dad. I will not smoke but I will go to the pub for a beer. My house would be in Streatham and it would be very modern if I had the money. My wife would be small and have fair har. I would go to the cinema with my wife and I would try and get her to go to Tottenham, I would also have a colour television.  Words: 123
