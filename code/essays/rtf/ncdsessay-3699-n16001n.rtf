I am 25 years old. I am intrested in horse riding and my job is a horse groom I go to other countries every year. I am leading a very happy life so far. Each day I clean horse stables and groom the horses so that they are shiny. Once a year their is a horse show nearby. I go their so that if they get untidy I am always their to do them. I get home in the evening and start drawing sketches. of horses and other animal pictures and when I finish them I hang them on the wall. I have a rest every Sunday so that somebody else can have a go. I've got a reserve for my job when I'm away I became very ill once and had to stay in bed for a week. The doctor came and said that I had German Measles. and said that I couldn't do my job for at least a fortnight, but I soon got over that. I got well in a week and was doing my job the next week. I got marrid after my illness so now I am allright.  Words: 193
