At the age of twenty five I would have started work have a good job and a good wage round about 19 to 20 pounds my home work would about my job and my hobbie football. I would have a garden, flowers all round the grass and at the other side of the footpath I would grow vegetables like carrots, lettace, spring onions and cabbage. And my job would be on the baundry* and play for the football team.  Words: 79
