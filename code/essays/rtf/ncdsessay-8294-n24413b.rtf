my life
when I leave school I will go straight to work. I might be a fireman or a bus driver of a train driver. I will try and get a good job so that I can get a lot of money. I will by a house out in the country where it is pea*full and Quite when I get some money i will get marr*** and have some children I will do painting and drawing and go swiming. I will make model I motor boAts and planes and in my spare time I will sail then and fly them.  and I will colect coins and sell them for money . And when I get enough money I might go and live in Australia . I might bye a rabbit or a hampster I like sining and having drama at school and I will carry on doing it when Im older. I will go for long walks in the country . And I might have a good life.  Words: 167
