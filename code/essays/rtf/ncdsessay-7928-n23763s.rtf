I am now 25 years of age. I am a nurse in a hospital. I find my work very interesting and enjoyable, also it is so worthwhile. People say a nurse is a very under-payed job but I myself think that it is payment enough to see the patient recover from it's illness or disease. 
      When I was training as a nurse my parents were a great help to me, if ever I had any worries or problems I knew I could always rely on my parents to help. I go and see my parents every week-end. I enjoy my work as a nurse very much and will always continue to do so.
