Some times we all go out for a ride in our car. I love to go through the country lanes in the autermn and see all the golden-brown leaves falling onto the road, My children go to school at 8 'o' clock in the morning and come home at 4 o'clock at night. I go to work at Simmonds the hair dressers. I work full time half past 8 inthe mornings and get in at 5 at night times. I like my job as a hair dresser.  I have many friends that come into the shop. I talk to them whilst I am rolling their hair up. My husband works on a farm near our house. We get 4dozen of new laied eggs every Week and 2pints of milk every day.
