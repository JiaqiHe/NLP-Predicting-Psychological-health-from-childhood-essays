----------------------
I am leading a good and happy life. I enjoy my work very much as a hair-dresser my staff works very hard and get's lots of money. I like my staff. At home my next-doorneibth would look after my two year old dauther, and when I got home I gave her tea and then sent her to bed, and then got writing. So all this keeps me very busy. and as well as being busy, my job keeps me happy and going. I sometimes get Saturdays off so we go visting or Sight-seeing or shopping which I always enjoy doing.
