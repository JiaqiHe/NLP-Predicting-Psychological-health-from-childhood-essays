I am now 25 training to be a nurse which is very interesting. Quite often I read and occasionally fo swimming and playing tennis and at fills up most of my spare time. I still live at home and I enjoy helping my mother at home cooking and cleaning the house. I have my own car and often go at away for the week sometimes going with a friend to somewhere like the **** camping in a caravan or tent. In the week I am usually at the hospital as a cadet nurse although I get wednesday off to do the shopping and either play teneis or go swimming and read quietly in the evening or help my mother altogether I have a very interesting life.
