My home is in (place) . I work in the Royal infirmary as a nurse in the children wards I have a great interest for to help children to teach them to ride a horse and swim. I also want to help them to walk when they have got *olis, and are crippled.
I also like to help the poor people and the very sick. Later when I retire I shall go over to other places and help the *people out in (place) Africa. And places where people are out of from other lands who can only pay for enough food for there children I shall teach them how to write and to talk English and other languages such as French and *erman Latin Norwegen and many other languages. Before I retire and I have days of I shall go out to pony treck with my one horse .
I shall canter over the country-side and stop by a stream and have a picnic and let the horse have some water. later I shal buy another horse and take one of the children for exersise, and to teach her or him to ride.
I would have liked to have been a teacher but I do nott think I have the skill an nolledge as a teacher should have. If I was a teacher I would like to have taken a class which had just started school So I could be able to give them a start by the easy things and then gradualy give them harder things and so it wouldnt be so hard on them when they were in a higher class But now I enjoy my work as a nurse and I do not* think I would like to change,  Words: 289
