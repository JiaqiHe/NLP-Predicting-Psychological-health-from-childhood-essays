When I am 25 years old would like to go round to icland and live there to be a farmer or have jobs in that way becuse it some people say that it is very cold there but it is quit hot thats why it isn't so hot in winter thats why there isn't alot of people there and you can have a choice either have a country village or have a town to live in it can be a bit dark in the morning but they have special mirrors to r*stect light.
