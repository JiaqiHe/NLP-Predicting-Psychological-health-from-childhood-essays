I am in the (place) and I am an enginer. In the middle of the night about 1 o clock in the morning I had a telephone call to say that a plane had crashed at the Base and that they needed me over there. When I got there I found that the fire in the plane had been put out so i went to have a look to see if the people were Badly hurt. When i got to the hospital they said that all the crew were killed in the crash. The next morning when i got to the Base I found out that one of the engines had gone rong with one of the engines and they wanted me and some other enginers to try and find out what went rong. When we had got out the engine's and had got them in the hanger we started to strip the down. The job of striping them down took many weeks and when we had got them all in Bit we found out that somthing had gone rong with the fuel system and the engine had caught fire so the pilot had to switch of the fuel line to the engine. He switched off the fuel and then the wing started to catch fire and that they had to crash land on the runway But when the plane hit the run way the plane burst into the flames killing all the crew because they didn't have time to get out of the Burning aiRcraft and so that mistory was solved.
