I am leading an exiting life at 25 years of age. I have now joined the army. You learn many things in the army. We had practised climeing over nets and many drills. In my spare time I played for the army football team. I have been to many countries fighting. When I first came I wanted to be an electrician but now fighting is more exiting. When I go home I go out for a drink. A few months ago I was sergant but I missed the train home so I was brought down, a peg or two I got a stripe taken off. This month were going to Paxistan to fight. Today we got the machine gun and are learning how to dive down and start shooting at your target straight away. Next week the boxing championships are on in the heavy weight bouts there is a man who weighs over twenty stone. I am reserve in the welterweight matches dought if I will win though.  Words: 168
