If I were 25 I should like to be a footballer, cricketer and a swimming instructor. I should like to be a footballer first because I have played for the school team for a long time and it is a fast game, with adventur**s tackles and shots. 
     The first team I should play for or try to play for would be Leeds Utd. Res. Then from there I would try to work my way up to Leeds Utd top team or first team. My second choice would be a swimming instuctor, because I like swimming alot and think I could be a good swimmer if I tried and stick at it a long time. I should like to be a channel swimmer, but I dont think I would be strong enough. At home I would want to do all my things myself and I would have to because I will not get marride or I hope I won't. If I could not be any of the two things I should like to be seafolder like my father is now, or a steel-erector. I hope I can be one or the other of the two things. I would not make a very good cricketer so I don't think I shall play cricket for any team like England, West Indies, and M.C.C. cricket club.  Words: 223
