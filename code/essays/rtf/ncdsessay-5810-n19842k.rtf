There is a lot of modern machinery at this work and I have to be very careful when I handle them. I opend my life at home Gardening and doing other things. My hobbies are cricket, Gardening and football. I have to pay all the bills and help with the housework. I have got a very good car and I have done hundreds of mile in it. In the summer I take myfamily to the country or sometimes abroad to Italy, we all enjoy going to Italy because we go by ship. I have to go back to work after my holiday and thats when the work gets very hard. because there is a lot to do. When I get home I have my sipper then I sit down and read the paper. When I have finished reading the paper. I watch the televison till I want to go to bed. I wake in the morning and I have to leave for work at seven o'clock after I have had a bath and had my breakfast. When I leave work I will open a small shop and sell sweets paper, cards pens and toys, pets and last of all writing paper. I will not live up staied from my shop but at my home.
