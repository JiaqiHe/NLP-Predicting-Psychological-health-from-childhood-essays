At the age of twenty five I hope to be a teenage clothing designer. Also I would like my own fashion boutique in London and it would be called Fashion Parade. I would have left home and rented a flat in London near my shop. Every so often I change the name of the boutique. I write to my parents twice a week and visit them once every fortnight. I hope to be married this year or next and have two children. My interests are drawing and designing womens clothes and house furniture. I enjoy my spare time as I go for walks and think out what my next designs will be I hope My family help me think up my new ideas. If it came about that I could not have a boutique I would like a shop that lends out clothing it would be called a Lenderette. inside there would be racks of clothes, each rack would hold something different one would hold dresses, another gowns, and one would have coats. There would also be one rack one which swimwear would be gathered on. If I am married by the time I am twenty five I hope that my husband will also have a Lenderette shop for men. This shop would be situated in Sheffield and I would live above my shop. I would like an older boy then girl in my family consisting of me my husband and my two children. We would visit my parents once a week and we would visit my husbands parents also once a week. For our holidays we would go abroad  Words: 270
