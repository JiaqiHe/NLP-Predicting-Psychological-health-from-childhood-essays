I think that there is a lot of thing that I would like to be at the age of 25. one of them is a nurse but this puts me off* by the thought of going into the operating theatre. Another is to to do balley but I think that the satage puts me of and the thought of all the people sa**hing me dance. I think that at home I would like to help my mum and read. Most of all I would like to look after children. Becasue I like them very much. I would like to have a child of my own i* I could I would like to sew in my free time because I I like sewing or I would like to kr*int thing not just for my set but for other people. I think that at a bout 25 I would like to get married and have a house of my own or a flat. I would like to live neare the sea side and go swiming every day. I would like to live neare the sea side because I like the small as the sea air. I would like to travel all for. Because I like to see other places like **** and **** France and pairs.  Words: 214
