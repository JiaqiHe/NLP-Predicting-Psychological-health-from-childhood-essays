I often travel abroard with my friends. I have a flat, that one of my friend's and I live in. I have no garden so I have plants in pots and winow boxs. All my stamps are now in a big case, which I bought. My friend and I go to work at a big nursery, we get most of our plants from there, we don't own it but we get good pay. If I am short of money I drive a taxi. I get weeks holiday at whitsun. My friend and I are hoping to buy the nursery between us as soon as we have raised enought money. We often visit our relaitons. Our flat is in [town]. We make our ouwn meals, he taught me some recipes, and I taught him some. We usually go out together on Sundays. The nursery we are going to buy will cost us five thousand pounds. Sometimes I go and help children with their stamp clubs, I go to one every fortnight. WHen I go visiting I sometimes help them in their gardens. I always used to go in the garden when I was a boy. I often give flowers as presents to friends and relations. I went to Iceland not long ago, there are a lot of swimming pools there, I taught my friend to swim and dive there. After that he went swimming every week, at the baths in the town centre.
