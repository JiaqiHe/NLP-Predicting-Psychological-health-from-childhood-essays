My age is 25 years old and I have a job as a vet every day I inject dogs, cats, and other different animals. One day a lady bought in a syamees cat inwhich she would not ear or drinck and was very thin and seemed very ill, I took her into the surgary and egsamined her and I found she had numonia so I injected it and then I told the lady who's name was Mrs [surname] I told her that she had numonia I had to keep the cat in so that I could inject her every day and also mix tablets with her food. Each day the cat was getting better, I had Mrs Moor's phone number and so I rang her up and told her that she could come and fetch her cat in two days time and she is feeding better than ever and that it will cost xxxx3 17s 6d when the cat went a man came in with an holsation dog in which had a badly cut foot I took him in to the surgarie and got a larg peice of glass out but before I did this I had to give him an injection to stop the pain and then I bandaged it up.
