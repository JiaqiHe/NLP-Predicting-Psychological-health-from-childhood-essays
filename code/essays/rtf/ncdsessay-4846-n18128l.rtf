I am now 25 years old and I am a professional footballer. I am in the (team). I recieve a wage of xxxx130 a week. My position is out-side right. I have a few mates in my team. Every week I have nearly scored a goal. The best game I have ever played is when I was picked to play for Scotland. I scored a hat-trick and the fans went absolutely crazy. We have won the League Cup four times in a row , the F.A. Cup twice in a row, and have won the English Cup once. We have qualified for the European Cup, but we were knocked out in the semi-final by (team) . The score was 3-2 for them. My home life is great because I am married with five children. In my spare time I own a sport's shop. Many customers come into my shop to get my autograph, and to buy football togs, and footballs.
My interests are cooking, going out to clubs, and watching television.  Words: 170
