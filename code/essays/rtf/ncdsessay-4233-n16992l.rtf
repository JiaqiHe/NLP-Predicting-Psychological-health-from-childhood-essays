Every day, I get up and my work is teaching art in a secondary school. I wold take a large painting or picture to the school for my pupils to coppey. Other interests of mine are shooting, (clay pigeons. not annimals) riding with a bycycle-club, riding horses and making things from wood. I live in a cottage in the country near my parents, and I have a dog as a pet. My car is a Fiat 500 and one day, when I have enough money I will emegrate to Australia, my favorite country. I will carry on my work there as I do here. I will probaly live in the suburbs of some town.  Words: 114
