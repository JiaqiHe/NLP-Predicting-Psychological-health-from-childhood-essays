I have just got my Certificate for teaching and hope to be a lecture latar on, I hope to lecture on English and Norse Mythology. As a part time job I am teaching a few children to play the piano. I am not very good at mending clothes and so I am going to neddleowrk classes. I go to bed as soon as I have finished preparing for the next day which is usauly 10 to 11 o clock but sometimes I go out and arrive back later. 
I still read a lot but I do not have so much time now. During some weekends I visit my father and mother and also my youngest brother [male name] who still lives with them since he is only eighteen he will be leaving school soon. I am sharing a flat with my school friends [female name] [surname]. Every so often I go horse riding.
About once every month I go to visit places of historical interest. [female name] and I take turns at cooking and washing up we do not have very expencive tastes but at weekend we ocasinaley have chicken or pork.  Words: 191
