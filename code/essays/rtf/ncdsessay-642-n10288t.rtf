I am twenty five years old. and Job is flying R.A.F Vulkans, and lightings. This job is very interesting, because you go to difarant Countrys and you go on important misshons like refuling Vicktor bombers, if one thing gose wrong when you are refuleing the danger of your life, and the crew of the Vicktor is in your hands because when you refule the bomber you have to fire a flexable pipe, and if that pipe hit the wrong part of the fule tank the bomber will blow up and so will your plane. In a few more weeks I will go on my last misshon at this base because I am going to be posten to Scandinavia.  Words: 118
