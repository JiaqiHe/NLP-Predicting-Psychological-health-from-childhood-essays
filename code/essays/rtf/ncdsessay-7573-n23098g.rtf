I got up at about 1/2 past 6 and got changed. I had a quick snack and wash. * locked up the falt, (where I live) and said goodmorning to the lift boy. I then caught a bus to the hospital where I work. There would be a bit of traffic on the road because people would be starting to go to work. When I got to work I would be on ward duty or something like that. Then at 12 O'Clock (noon) I (should) went home for lunch (break) I had my lunch and as I had 3/4 of an hour left I sat down and did some knitting for my sister's child's doll. It was a pink wool dress, holes at the bottom of it and moss stich at the top. there was also the bag to knit in moss stich and the shawl in *** the holey pattern. Then I would go back to work and probably give a few people jobs. Ugh! After I had finished I would go and see what time it was on the next day. I'd then get a bus home and get changed into a dress. It would be about 5 O'Clock. I had a wash and put my makeup on (eye shadow, mascara, lipstick, foundation and powder) then I would go and have to a dinner party with some of my friends. To top that off (I) we also went dancing. At a-bout 10 O'Clock I would go to bed tired out.  Words: 252
