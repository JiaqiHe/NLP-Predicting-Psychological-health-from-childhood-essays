I am a Ship's engineer. I live at the moment on the Royal Navy vessel 'Polyanther.' I enjoy the life at sea and like carving chessmen in my spare time. The captain's name is [surname]. He is a very nice man.
I have a Junior assistant called [male name] [surname]. He is very clever and works the signaling lights faster than anyone aboard.
I share a cabin with the ships navigator. His name is Ironside but we all call him rusty, for ovious reasons. I like him very much. I am a bachelor. I have a cottage in the lake district where there is plenty of scope for fishing, walking and sailing. I am not a fisherman myself but I do a lot of sailing. 
Life on board shop is not just exciting, it is intresting as well. I have seen quite a few countries and have landed at most of them. I don't know why everybody dosen't join the Navy, life is really enjoyable.
In a storm is is not so much fun. I am constantly mending failing engines and other things such as wirelases and the ships loudspeaker. I really enjoy this life of sea.  Words: 194
