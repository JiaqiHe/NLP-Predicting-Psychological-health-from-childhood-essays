My interests are swimming and playing tennis and ten-pin-bowling. The home life I live, is a very short one for I work most of the time. I am a nurse, It is a very nice job and I am very intersested in it. When I am off-duty I ether go homne or go to the nurses-home and talk with the other nurses. The life I am leading is interesting I go home when ever I can and I have a good time. the holiday we have is for about 5 five weeks. When we were training It was for about four weeks we had off. When we go on holiday we swim, play tennis and play ten-pin-bowling, sometimes we play golf. The other night when I was on duty or just go off duty I was walking down the corridor with another nurse when we heard a bang like if something had exploded then we heard another bang only louder I looked around and then I saw that It came from the lab.
