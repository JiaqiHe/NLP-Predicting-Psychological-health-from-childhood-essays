I am twenty five and I live near Kent. I am a racing driver and I race for Gold Leaf Team Lotus, Graham Hill is our best driver and Jochen Rindt is a little better than I am, so of course I drive the worst car.
Jacky Stewart is World Champion and he drives for Matra, and Jack Brabham was second in points, Graham Hill was third.
Rindt crashed after his xerofoil came off in the South African Grand Prix, I retired, but Hill won and Denny Hulme came second with Steward third. So Hill was ahead with points. It was the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch near where I live. 
Hill took the lead for a long then he got some trouble with the engine and retired, Stewart took the lead with Rindt is second place, I was in third place. Then Rindt had alot of trouble with his gearbox and eventually retired.
I was left in second place with Stewart making a big lead.
This was how it finished with me second and Brabham third.
When I wasn't racing I enjoyed myself at home with my children playing cricket with them and having races with them using our Scalextric set and repairing cars when they don't work, normally I put the cars whenever they came off. I had a very happy time.  Words: 220
