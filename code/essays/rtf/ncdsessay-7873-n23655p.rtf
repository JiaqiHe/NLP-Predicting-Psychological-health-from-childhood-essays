Mondays I would go out in the car and have a look around to see if I want anything. Then If I found somthing I need I would buy it. When I had finished I would buy my mother something, the same as I did when I was 11. Tuesday I would stay at home and find somthing to do. About ten I would go to work. There I would stay untill half past four. Then I would come home, have my tea and at half past seven I would go swimming. As you myof guessed I am a bachalor and I live with my mother and father. I have three other brothers called [male name] whos twenty six [male name] whos twenty two and [male name] whos eighteen. My mother has a corgi whos name is Kimy, as we had a corgi when I was ten. Wednesday I would get up early and go to work. When I come home I would have my tea. Thurday morning I would be able to lie in untill half past ten. The place I work would not be far and I would have a job that would keep me fit. On Friday it would be the same as Wednesday. But at night I would go out with my mum and dad down the pub and get a round of drinks.  Words: 228
