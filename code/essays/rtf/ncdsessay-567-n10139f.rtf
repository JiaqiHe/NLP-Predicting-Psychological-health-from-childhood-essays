WHEN I AM 25 I WANT TO BE A TEACHER. I AM TEACHING A CLASS OF 30 AND IT IS NEARLY A HOLIDAY AT HOME I HAVE A DOG WHO I LEAVE AT A FREINDS AND I AM GOING TO TEACH FOR A FEW MORE MONTHS AND THEN I AM GOING TO BE A VET BECOUSE I LIKE ANIMMALS OR IF NOT THAT A NURSE. AFTER A FEW MORE MONTHS LATER I BEECAME A VET NOW I HAVE A CAT AND THE CAT AND THE DOG ARE ALWAYS FIGHTING SO IT IS LUCKY THAT MY FRIEND TAKES THE DOG BUT THE CAT CANT BE LEFT AT HOME SO MY FRIENT IS GOING TO BUY IT. I LIKE BEING A VET BUT SOME TIMES IT IS TIARING AND SOME ANIMMALS ARE VISHUS I WOLD LIKE TO BE AN AIR HOSTES BUT MY AUNT DIED WHEN THE PLAIN CRASHED SO IM NOT GETTING THAT JOB BUT REALY I AM GOING TO STILL BE A VET WHEN I WAS A TEACHER I GOT BOARD BUT WHEN I GET OLDER I'LL BE SOMETHING ELSE BECOUSE I DO NOT LIKE THE SAME JOB ALL THE TIME. THE REASON WHY I WANTED TO BE A VET IS THAT I LIKE ANIMMALS I GET ABOUT xxxx35 A WEEK AND I PRACTICE TYPING AND ONE OF MY HOBIES IS WRITING STOREYS I DONT THINK I WRITE VERY GOOD STOREYS THOUGH.
