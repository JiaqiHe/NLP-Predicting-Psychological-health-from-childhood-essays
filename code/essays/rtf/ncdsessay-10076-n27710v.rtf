I've left school my age is 25 and I am training to be a footballer and to play at wembley. the first time went into the ground I was very nervous But now I am ust to it. it is hard work being a footballer. when you go into the ground you report to the manger in his office and offer that you go into the dressing room a get changed into your football kit and track* *oo*. you get back in your car and go up to your training ground take off your track *oot and start to run up and down the pitch. And after that you come back to your trainer and gives you something else to do after your training you go back get changed and go out nearly all the time people are wanting to take your autograph. when you are at home again you can have arest or take your familey out for the rest of the day.
