I have left university and am working very happily. As a vetinary surgeon. I am not married and therefore am living with my parents. I still enjoy horse riding although I have a car of my own and as you may see from my work I still adore animals especially dogs. As I live with my parents I do most of the decorating and many of the household chors. I simply love going for rides on horse back and taking my dog for walks. I like sewing and make many dresses for myself and my mother. I do many of the things that I liked doing when I was younger such as visiting farm and seeing the animals.  Words: 118
