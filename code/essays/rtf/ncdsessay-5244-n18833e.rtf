If I was 25 years old I would go to work and get some money to live on I would work at a factory in [town]. I like reading library books from the library at night. I would cook meals when it is time for them to have it. It would be a nice life to lead if I was 25 years old. I will go to clubs and dance halls with some of my friends that I went to School with when I went. I would go shopping every Friday straight from work. We would watch the television at night too. We would play cards and other things in the house and out side in the streets. In the factory I would make shirts and other things to wear on your backs. I will get up at 6 o,clock in the morning and start work at 8 o.clock in the factory. Working in a factory is a living for young women like me and my friends that went to school together once. In the morning I would clean up and do before I went to work at 7,o.clock. My friends and I don't go to work on Saturday and Sunday we stay at home and make some dinner for them to eat. We will write letters to our friends who live along way from us or them that are in hospital. We would one or two children in the family to live with us for ever. I would live happily ever after.
