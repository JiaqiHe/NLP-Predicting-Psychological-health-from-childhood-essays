I am now married and I go every fortnight to see my team Leeds united play at home. I can drive so I can go places to work etc. My job is to see all machinery is kept in order. Our house is set upon a hilly place called [place name]. It is covered with white peble dach and is a bungalow left by itself. My car is a white viva. My wage is not quiete 50 pounds a week. Sundays we often set of about seven. o clock. I have a few of freinds and life Leeds cant play because of the wet ground I go to see my brother play football center half who plays for Fulham. Now I will have to be going to work.  Words: 128
