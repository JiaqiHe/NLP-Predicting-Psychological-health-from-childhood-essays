I have been married for five years and have two little girls who are twins, they are called [female name] and [female name]. Very often when I am not busy I go over to one of my friends places for coffee. Sometimes of a Friday night if [male name] is home I go to the local Drama club of which I am very fond. The twins are three years old, I make most of their clothes, usually when they are out playing they wear their cat-suits.
I like cooking, and I enjoy making the food for the twins birthdays. In the summer the twins and I go to the beach, I enjoy swimming very much; the twins try to swim but are not managing it.
In the mornings I do the workl and in the afternoons [female name], [female name] and I usually go out for a walk or else visit someone, or someone visits us.
When Mum and Dad come in on Tuesday [male name] and I sometimes go out for a meal or for a drink. I enjoy being married and I could not manage without the twins or [male name].  Words: 190
