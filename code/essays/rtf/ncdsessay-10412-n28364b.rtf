If I were 25 I would may be married and would have a gob as a secutery. Every night when my husband comes home I will have tea ready, and on his birthday I would have a lovly presant for him. I would do the house work like this. I would hover ober the whole house every day and dust, check the wardrobes make the beds and wash some clothes every day. If I have children I would have two children maybe a girl and boy but I would rather have two of boy or girl. I would like two children because one may be scared and the other could talk to her or him not make them lonly and they would have someone to play with.  Words: 127
