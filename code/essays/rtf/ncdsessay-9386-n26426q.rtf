"I am 25 years old and teach at a school called ""[school name]' for girls and boys under 12. I have thirty two children in my class My aim in life is to try and become a Headmistress ofx or a Depetuy Head today at school we are doing a subject on Roman life. One of the children named [surname] hates this lesson and starts playing tricks. The other day she put a toy snake in my desk and when I opened it I got* a fright of life. I have four children, two boys and two girls each are twins. They drive me up the wall sometimes and yet on the other hand they havex are as good as gold. I have another job which I do and that is a champion swimmer. Everyday during the holidays myself and children go down to the ""Star swiming Pool"". This is where most champion swimmers come when they have to compete against others. I enjoy this very much and last summer I won two medals and one gold cup. The stropes* that I had to do for them were breast crawl backstroke and butterfly most of my children can swim well and I feel rather proud of myself. I am now back at school and most of my children are working much better and [surname] is not playing any more tricks. I hope to be a teacher and a star swimmer for as long as I live"  Words: 246
