I would try to sign-on for Halifax A.F.C. Reserves, and to get into the first team. I hope to get transferd* to reserves of atean getting premoted to the third. division untill I would be good enough to play for the first division. As my favorite team is West Ham united F.C. I would hope very much to play for them and wear the crossed hammers badge at Upton Park in London. My ambision is to play for England at wembley and win the Jules Rimit World cuptrophy. At home I would probabley if (I could play for Englad) be signing my authographs all day. But if I didn't I will be doing some work. as an engineer fixing jobs like the car engine, a carpenter makeing cabinits and shelves. I could be an electrision mending light swiches, televisions or electric blankets. it might be easy I do'nt know but if it is I might enjoy my self going out for rides in (if I have one) a car on picnics in the country or somewhere nice and peaceful where I can rest and read books. I would be happy enough like that. as long as I do'nt meet the works boss while I am doing so because I won't get a rest for talking buisness with him.  Words: 218
