When I am 25 I would like to the Join the Army or the R.A.F. If I joined the R.A.F I would like to fly a Phatom jet aircraft or a vertical take off Harrier jet aircraft they can both fly at super sonic speed. If I was in the Army I would like to be in the Tank division and drive an Chifton tank it is the latest tank in the Army.  Words: 73
