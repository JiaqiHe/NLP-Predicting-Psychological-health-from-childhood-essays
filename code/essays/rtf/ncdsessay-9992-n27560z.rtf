I would lead an interesting life but when I am too old for football I would want to be a Trainer for a football team. 
My hobbies would be about the same, they are match Collecting, stamps Collecting, Swimming, of course football and photographer. I could collect match Boxes when my team are playing away from home. 
I Could get stamps in some stamp shops. Swimming I might go once a week. Well I would play football.
Photography, I would only have a small camera I would not have all of the flashy aquipment.
I would like to be married and have my own home and have children.  Words: 106
