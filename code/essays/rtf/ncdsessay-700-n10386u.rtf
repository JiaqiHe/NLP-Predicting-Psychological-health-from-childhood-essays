When I am twenty five I will be married and living in Devon My husband is a hard working and earning a good sum of money. I have just one child that has just stated school at Easter. Since she has gone to school I got a job as a vet. I had this job before I was married. For the evenings I will join some dramatic society. I will go to dances and concerts with my husband. I will also practice my violin and perform at concerts*. My husband also likes music and plays the piano. In evenings when we are not going out we play duets together for the piano and violin. Our home will be a a modern bungalow in the heart of Deven. It has a large kitchen with very large and low windows. The living room is also large with a stone fire place and wooden panling above the fire place. The hall way is wide with a large variated Ivy and other hanging plants.
