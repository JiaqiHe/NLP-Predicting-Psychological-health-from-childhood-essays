When I am twenty five I will probelly try and get a job as a post office casheir. I would live in a small cottage on my own for a few years. The cottage would be somewere in a quite district of London. Owning a post office would be an easy job. I'd soon get regular customers. Comeing to me and asking for stamps and envelopes e.c.t. Then I might get married to someone and then become a father. I'm not sure how many children I would have but I would teach them the nessacery things of life. At the age of twenty five new things would of happened to make life easyer or harder. I would still be intrested in things that I am now. I would learn to drive a car then by one of my own and take my wife around to London I look and by things from the shops. And on a day which the post office is closed I would take my children to the pupluc parks in the area. The family could all go for a picnic on a warm sunny day. Soon my sons or daughters would call me dad and grow up.  Words: 201
