I have to be at work at 7'o'clock. I am a mechanice fixing up cars which have broken down. In my spare time Ill dig the garden and probaly ofton go to a football match. MY house has got a tele this place is only a flat in it I have a small kitchen to work in. At first when I got the the place I decorated the place and bought the furnature. I'd have a dog in the place. Besides going to football and digging I'd do some mechanical stuf at home. I'd work quite long hours at work and somtimes shif work. when I had quite a long hoilday I'd go off places for days. I hope I'd like my work and enjoy it. I'd save up enough to get a car and not spend it at all. I'd put some in the bank. My I wouldn't like to near the city centre for I would like to go into the country quite alot and ofton vist my mum and dad. And go and vist my sister and friends when I had timeoff, for quite a lot of my time would be at work. But I'd to get time off to do these these things but I'd have to work to get the money and maybe want to buy something for the house. I would not always go out when I got spare for somtimes I'd stay home and so some digging and plant vegtables for me to eat and I'd try to grow a lawn and plant flowers to make it look nice when I got a house when I had it I would a pond in the garden and have a hedge instead of a wall I'd buy fish pond.
