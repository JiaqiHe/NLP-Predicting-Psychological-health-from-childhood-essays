My name is **** I live in a house with my dog and cat. What I like doing best is taking my dog for a walk he is very clever because he will do what I will tell him. One day as I was doing the house work my dog went up stairs because that is were I keep his basket were he goes to sleep. I thought he would go to sleep. So I went up stairs to make sure. When I got in the room he was sleeping away. I went queitly down stairs and went to work. I used to work at a facotry where you make hats and at the other side of the factory you make dresses. Now I work at a school I teach girls to play netball and rounders.  Words: 136
