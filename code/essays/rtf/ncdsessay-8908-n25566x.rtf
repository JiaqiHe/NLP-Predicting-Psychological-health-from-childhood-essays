I am 25 and a few weeks ago I joined up in the R.A.F. A week after I joined I started training to be a pilot. At first I couldent control the plane but I soon got used to it. I have passed some tests but still have to do a lot of hard training before I can take up a plane on my own. I have made plenty of friends and I am enjoying life in the air force. At home my mum worried because she does not like the idea of me going up in a big Jet. When I sleep in my bunk bed I always think I am in a plane but I always forget my dream when I am woken up at 7 o'clock for the daily routine. First we have inspeciton by the Group Captain then we get on with what we are supposed to be doing. Then we go and have breakfast, after that we get briefed on what the squadron is going to do today or where its going to go. About 6 hours later we arive back have our lunch and were off again for more briefing and practise take-off and landing. At 5 o clock we go to are barracks or we go home for as long as we like. On Saterdays and Sunday it is our holiday we go out to the cinema or club and enjoy ourselves but the weekend ends all too soon and its back to work for another week.  Words: 254
