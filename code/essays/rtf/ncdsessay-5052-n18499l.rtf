I live in a Bungalow very near the beach there are trees behind and either side of it. There are a few people living there, and to get in to the village you have to walk a mile down a very winding lane, I do this every day because I go to work down in [village]. I work in a grocers shop. It is very nice because you get to know people from different parts of England and some times from other countries. Every night I get home at 5 o'clock and get the dinner ready for my husband and children. I have got 2 [female name] and [female name] they are both five. When we've all had our dinner and washed up. We all go for a walk sometimes we go down to the shore it is very interesting when the tide is out because there are very large rocks there and leave rock pools that we explore the rocks go right along the coast as far as you can see. Sometimes we just go down for a swim. When we all have the day off we go out in the car to [village] where we stay for the day. It is fun living in [village].  Words: 207
