I am 25 years old I am a maid in a hotel. I start work for seven* in* the morning till six at night. I would like to get married when I am 26 years old. I like painting and drawing I also like music. When I go to work I fetch all my working tools from the cupboard then I go up stairs and make the beds. I have a chamber maid to help me with the bedrooms and she also helps me with the downstairs work. After I have finshed upstairs and downstairs I have to go and get some meals ready. There are people in the hotel all day and nearly post* of the night. I know this because I sometimes stay and work over time. When  Words: 130
