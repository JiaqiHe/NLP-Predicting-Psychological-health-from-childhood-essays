The life I am leading is in the R.A.F., and I am stationed on an aircraft carrier in the mediteranean on training sessions. My intrests are radio-electronics, helicopter-pilot, rowing, swimming and skin-diving*. My home life is one of being a re*ting man from the R.A.F., and I enjoy a lot of gardening, picnic, swimming and drining all around the country. The most intesting life and work I would do on short holidays would be, a part-time school teacher in a crand-new modern school in England on the coast of ****, where some of my relitives live, and if the job of part-time schoolteacher did not last me all the holiday I would organise sea-fishing trips just off the coast of ****. I would own a large motor launch of 25 lory with calvin and a *ally and I would travel in this with any wife all around the ***rts of England.  Words: 151
