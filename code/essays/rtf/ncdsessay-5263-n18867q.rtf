I would get up about eight o'clock and begin to do the house work at half past eight. Then at nine o'clock I would tack the children to school. When I get back I would make the beds. If there was any shopping to do. I would go down to the shoppes get what I *** need and go home, by the time I've got there it is nerely dinner time, so I get the dinner ***** don, go and get the children from school. After I've took them back I go to work. I would work in the (shop) shop for about three hour then go for the children. When they have had there tea they would play out till I have clared a way the plats and all the things we used for tea. Then I would call the children in for a bath then get them rae ready for bed. They would stay up for a bit then I will put them to bed and on sunday they would go to sunday school. I would ass also dress them properly so that they can (other) play with others, and so other children can not say things behind there backs.  Words: 202
