I have Just landid on the Helicopter Pad to deliver a few soldiers to my baracs. The helicopter is a westland wessex. I am the pilot and im'e 25 years old I Started about 5 years ago training and iv'e become a real pilot only for 10 months now. Sometimes we fly over forest and I take the men on training and learn them how to bail out if we were in trouble. Once we were in trouble when the rudder broke and the back propeler broke and we were out of control we were in a dive So I unfastened my Self from* the Seat and bailed out with the others. We landed in a forest over by a big lake when we had unfastend our parachutes we Set of on the right course (because the navigator had told us) to our barac's when we got there it was 2 o'clock in the morning. when we got to the gate we were allowed to pass and we were Sent to our group Captain. We told him every thing that had happend and then he Sent us to have a hot meal and we were Sent to our huts to get Some Sleep. The next morning we were on parade and when we were dismisted we reseaved the news that our helicopter had been found and brought back to base.  Words: 230
