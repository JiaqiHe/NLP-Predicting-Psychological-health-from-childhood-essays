I am 25 years of age and I live in [xxxxxxx], in a flat as I do not live with my parents. I have a pet cat called patch which is always pinching my balls of wool as I am knitting myself a jumper. I am very pleased with what I have got and I am enjoying my work. I am working as a hairdresser in [xxxxxxx] and meet alot of knew people My friends do not work with me, but I see them quite alot after work and we usually go out for a snack and to the cinema. After work sometimes when I do not see my friends, my interests are Bird watching and walking in the country looking for knew places to walk. At the weekends I see my boyfriend and he takes me bowling, swimming and if it is nice for a game of tennis. In the evening he usually takes me to a Chinese Resturant. But most of all I like staying at home and watching the tellvision I like most of the programes that it is hard to say what I like best.  Words: 189
