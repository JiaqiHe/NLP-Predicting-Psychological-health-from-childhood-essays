My life is a short hand typing. I work in an office. My job is to type all the letter and important papers. I am married and have one child of 4 1/2 who goes to school. I like my job and have a nice manger. When I first learnt to type I could see letters on a typewriter but now I know where they are so I have them covered up with caps. I have a lot to type and sometimes do then at home. Quite often I write out the mangers speeches then type them out. My husband plays football for Cambridge united team at centre forward. We earn a good life. I'm also interested in being a hair de dresser. But I passed to be a short hand typest. I do my house work when I get home but it soon gets dirty again. My girl is quite well behaved and never swear or cheeks us back. Her work at school in quite good. When she was 11 she passed to go to grammer school for girls. After a while she left school and came a teacher. I was getting better at typing and had won cups and certiucuts. Soon our boss left and I bec*me boss of the firm. I was so thrilled I could hardly believe it but there it was. I still carried on with my typing and got more cups and certificates. There my story of my life ends.  Words: 246
