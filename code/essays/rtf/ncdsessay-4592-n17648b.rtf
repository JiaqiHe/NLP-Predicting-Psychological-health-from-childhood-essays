I am now 25 years of age, I am still at Collage, I am going to France, Italy, Spain and Veniss, this year, and when I finish at collage I want to be an interpreter. I still live with my mother and father, and often go visit my two sisters and their husbands. It's witsuntide in a few weeks and I will be going home for my holiday hoping to see my family again. I will be going to the town and bringing some presents to take back with me. I like collage very much and I wish I never had to leave. I am now hoping I will pass my G.C.E's. I have just finished one egsmae and enjoyed it very much. I have just sent a birthday gift of to mother, because it is her birthday in a couple of days, I sent her a pair of matching vases*. I have a dog at home it is a yorkshire terrier called Piper. I love playing with him when I go home for my holidays. I usually take him on the moors for a little run round.  Words: 188
