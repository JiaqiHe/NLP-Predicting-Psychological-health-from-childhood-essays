----------------------
I work in a hairdressing salon and I have been a qualified hairdresser for four years now.
      I have a family of one girl, [name] who is three and a boy, [name] aged 1. We live in a flat in Canterbury, for convenience, as my husband works in an ofice there (and it is handy for me too).
      It is hard going up and down stairs as we live on the second to top flat. (the lift has just broken).
I do a lot of sewing and knitting and belong to several clubs. My main interest is still hairdressing though and I do all the familys hair (exept my own) and some friends of coarse My friends and I often discuss our hobys and interests and occasionally get together and go on small trips.
      My mother and father often come to see us but they are alway complaining about the lift because it has broken down on varrios other occations. 
      At christmas we take it in turns to give partys This year it is [name]s (husband) and my own turn to give the party. We have already started preperations and are having great fun.  Words: 194
