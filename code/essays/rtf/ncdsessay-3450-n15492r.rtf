I am a secutary in a post office and usually I have a good deal of work during the day. My working hours are from 9am until 4pm and I have a break in between 12.00 and 12.30.pm. On Saturday when i'm not working I watch the Sports programme on television or go to football. On Sundays I visit my friends or my mother and father. I very seldom stay at home at the weekends. Nearly every year I go abroad for my holiday and stay with relations. This year I had a marvellous time in Southern France. I live in a small town just outside (town) which has many ancient remains. Just the other week the remains of a Roman Villa was found and I went along to have a look at it. Most parts of the decorated floor were still there and its remarkable how it was kept. I took a *ine camera and made a film of it. Then I invited my friends and neighbours to watch it and they seemed to enjoy it. My chief hobbies are, sport visiting foreign countries, archeaology and swimming. I also keep a stamp album which I`ve had since I was 7 and have a collection of over 1,000 stamps.  Words: 209
