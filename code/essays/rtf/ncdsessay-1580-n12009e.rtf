----------------------
I am now twenty-five and I am married to a man three years older than I am we are both interested in phsyciatry. My husband Christopher is a phsyciatrist and I am a lady doctor. We both enjoy our work and we are both in the same hospital. 
     Every saturday evening we go out to dinner at the pied piper and some times we invite. our friends to dinner. We have a medium sized bungalow in ****, and I hope to start driving lessens in a few months time. I am expecting a baby in seven months and so I might not be able to have the driving lessons so soon. Also I will not be able to go on working full time in the hospital, but I think I can get a job as a chemist. I lead a very happy home life although I do not see my parents or mother and father in law very often. I do not see them partly because they live quite a long way away and partly because I do not get much spare time. I still play tennis when I can and am going to try and teach my husband how to play, because he is always keen to learn new things.  Words: 212
