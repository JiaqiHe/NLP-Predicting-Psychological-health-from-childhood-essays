I am now 25 years old and I am starting a new life as a teacher. I have 32 in my class, and They are very noisey. It is a boarding school in Dover Kent. My best pupil is [female name] [surname].
I give the children midnight feast's, which they like very much. But I like also netball which I teach 4b and horse riding for the youngest class. I have many Interests at home, which are having my pupils in each night and they will write me a story. I also take a guides pack on Monday's at 6.Oclock which is also interesting.
I have 3 cats 2 dogs 5 mice and 2 goldfish but I do not look after them because my sister does. 
We have 4 holidays in our school, which are Christmas, Easter, half term, and Summer. My real Interests are. Going to the public library and read books about the story of mathamatics.
Also arranging parties for the school, like a fancy dress party or Christmas parties. 
Being the youngest teacher of the school it is my oppurtunity of being Headmistress when the headmaster is away.
It is a nice life being 25 but what i'm dreading is when I'm 26.  Words: 202
