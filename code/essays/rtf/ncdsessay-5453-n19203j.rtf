I am a footballer and I play for west ham. Yesterday we beat Spurs 5-0 and it was a tough match. I am not maried but I have a girl friend. I do not spend much time at home for I am always trainning for matches. My hobbies are football, tennis, criket. We have got a match on Saturday againest Aston Villa who have won the F.A. cup Seven times my position is inside left. Usually I go out to dinner with the team and we discuse matches and other teams. West ham Ham have had four manggers. Ron greenwood is our mangger now. I have played for west Ham for 4 months. I can not cook but usally my girl friend (Rosemary) comes round to my flat and cooks some dinner. Rosemary comes to every match I have played in. the manager is thinking of moving me to centre forward as I have scored the most goals for west Ham this season. All to gether I have scored 30 goals for this season.  Words: 174
