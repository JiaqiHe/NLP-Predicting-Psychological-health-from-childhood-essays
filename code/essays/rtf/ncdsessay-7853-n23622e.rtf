It is my 25 birthday* today and my boyfriend has asked me out tonight*. I am a hair-dresser* and my boyfriend* named [male name] works there too and that is how we met. Every day I go to work there and every Friday [male name] does my hair for me. At home I usualy do ** *** ** work for mum than I* *** all about hair* styles*. In spare times and at night time after* * o'clock I usually do* peoples* hair at home, untill about 8 or 9. I like doing peoples hair When I was small I used to be a hair-dresser with my sister and friends at home and I always used to be the hair-dressier with one other friend and never got fead up if my friends got fead up I used to do my dolls hair, And that is how I became a hair-dressier. [male name] has done my hair for tonight and it looks very nice indeed. I have just got a new dress from the money I erned so I will put that one on. I have been a hair-dressier since I left school and when I had finished training I was twenty and I have been one for five years. I always like to go out with [male name] because he takes me out to nice places and when ever we go out he askes me when are we going to marry. I keep on saying very soon. But tonight I am going to tell him in about one month* because it will give us time to get things ready. In a monts time we got married and I could do hair very nicely and I invented some other styiles.  Words: 289
