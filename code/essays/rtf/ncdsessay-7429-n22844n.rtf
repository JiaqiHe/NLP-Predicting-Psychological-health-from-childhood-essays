I am a footballer and I play for westham unt. They are in the first division and I earn about xxxx50 a week If our team wins a match we get a bonus of xxxx2. We trian every day for 1 1/2 hours and the rest of the day we have off for free time unless there is a match. In my free time I spend my time by fishing, and some times I help do the housework. I am married with one child. My wife is called barbare* and the child is called Andrew. Andrew is two years old and me and barabara have been married for 2 1/2 years. When I retire from playing football I do not no what I will do but I suppose their will be a chance of becoming a manager or a coach. If I do become a manager or a coach I hope to be with Westham  Words: 155
