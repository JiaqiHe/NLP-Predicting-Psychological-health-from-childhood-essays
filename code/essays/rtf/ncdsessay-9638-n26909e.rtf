I am 25 years old I work for an engineering company, and I repair things like cars, lorries and trains. I am leading an interesting live, in my spair time I keep pigeons and I race them every Saturday. If I win a pigeon race I get quiet a bit of money it gust depends how many birds there are in the race. The engineering company that I work for give me xxxx30 a week and thats alot of money if you are only working 5 days a week. I am marraid and I have not got any children. I have a busy day Saturday with pigeon racing in the morning and on Saturday afternoon I play football for Derby County. On Sunday I lay in bed until ten o'clock, and when Ive had my breakfast. I go for long walks in the country with my wife. On Sunday afternoon we go to my mothers and have tea there. If I work nights for this engineering company I get xxxx5 extra a week. On Thurday night if I am not working night I go to a pigeon club a learn a bit more about pigeon, this pigeon club organises the races every Saturday if it fit.  Words: 206
