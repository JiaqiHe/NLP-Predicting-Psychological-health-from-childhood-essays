When I am 25, I would like to be a riding instructor. I would like to have three children which are two girls and a boy. My house would be in the country, and the riding stable which I would work at would be just down the road. I would like my husband to be a film-star, and then he could take me to other countries where we would stay at and see different and exciting films.
Our house would be gaily decorated inside and out with roses and different creepers climbing up the walls. We would also have two cars and I would have a pony of my own if I had enough money.
The main colour in my bedroom would be pink and the curtains would be pink with white spots.
My main job I would have was to be a scretary in a school which I think would be very interesting. I'd practice typing at home in some of my spare time. Every morning I would start off work at 8.30 and get to the school at 8.50. The school would have 300 children and about 14 classrooms.
I would cook about 4 main meals a day - breakfast, dinner, tea and supper in the kitchen. I would make my children help with the washing up as well.
I think 25 is a very interesting age, because there is so much to do at work or home.  Words: 235
