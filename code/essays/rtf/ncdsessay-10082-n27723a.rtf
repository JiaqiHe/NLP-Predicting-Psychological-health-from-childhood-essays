I have left school all ready, I am working in a fashion shop, which is lovely. In the morning at 8.00 I get up, get ready and go by bus to work. When I get there I meet my work mates and then we all start working. We serve people all day long, and I sometimes help put some clothes on the dumies.
      At 4.00 I go home on the bus. When I get home I help mum a tiny bit, and at 5.30 I get my best clothes on to go out with my boy friend, [name]. Later at about 8.00 we go to the evening club. We play gamberling, and lots of other games and do a lot of dancing too.
      At 10.00 we go home and I watch television a bit and then go to bed. Most days are like that but not Sunday.  Words: 147
