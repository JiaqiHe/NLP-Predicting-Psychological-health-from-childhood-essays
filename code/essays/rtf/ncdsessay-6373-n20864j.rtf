I think that when I am 25 I will be married and that I might have children I think I might have a dog I think that I won't go out to work when the baby is small if I have one, but when it goes to school I might get a part time job. In the evenings sometimes I think I might go out to the pictures. I Also think that I will spend the money on what I earn on clothes and I will save what is left over. When I am married I think I would like my own house with quite a big garden. I think that my life at home won't be very busy. I think that I will like to have a car to drive around in so that I could get the shopping quickly and collect my children from school and also to go to work in. I think that if I go to work I would work in a bank or be a short hand typhist. I also think that in the evenings I will do gardening or watch tv. I think that I might also visit my parants and my sisters if they don't live far away. I think my hobbies will be cooking and dress making.  Words: 216
