"When I grow up I wont to be an ambulence driver. I would like to start the job when I am about twenty-five. I dont mind which hospital I work for as long as I get the job of a driver. When there was an acident I would get in the cab*, put the flashing light on and the siron and go as fast as I could go. I would pick them up and take them to hospital and hope that they would be all right and not seriouly hurt. I think I would be all right and not seriously hurt. I think I would like to get marred at twenty and have a car of my own. I would like two boys and two girls. By the way, some people die before they get to hospital. More people die in there home's in the car's on the road. I saw on the television once on ""Run for your life"" the man whose only got so long to live was going along the road at mid-night and all of a suddon is brakes went, and he skidded along to the middle fo the road and five cars crashed in to him, but he was lookey and jumped out before it blew up. There was one fire truck and two amberlance's. Three people died and four seriously hurt."  Words: 227
