"The alarm had just rang it was half past five. I got up and dressed and I went down to light the fire after I had switched the light on. My wife came down to help me with my breakfast. After Breakfast I got my packed lunch off of the chair put my boots on, and went outside to start my lorry. I came back in and I had my cup of tea befor I got back into my lorry. I eased off the hand break put the lorry in first gear then started: When I was at work the boss came to me and said
""Your fired. and you no what for and I don't want to see you again."" The thought of what I had done wrong had come back I used to go to the pub during lunch break and get nearly drunk and yesterday I was so drunk I smashed the bosse's car side window. Now I just walk down the streets with my hands in my poket going to the Gangoran and dragon pub while I live on money what my whife earnes I alway's want a job, but my drink comes first."
