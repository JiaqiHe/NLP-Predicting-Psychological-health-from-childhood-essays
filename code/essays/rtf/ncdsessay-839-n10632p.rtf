I am now 25 years of age and I cook 6 meals a day, one for Breakfast tea and dinner for my husband and myself. I have my own little shop in [road] I open at half past seven and my husband as got to be at work for 8,o,clock so he get,s up with me as well has his breakfast and he is of too work on the farm. My name is [name] and I have a very nice house in [road] I have Three dogs a budgie a cat and 2 mice which I have to look after all day. My shop closes at half-past-six pm. and then I go and give the animals there food and at 9.o.clock my husband arrives home in his lorry I give him his tea out of the oven and then we watch T.V.. I have some hobbies which I have a go at every now and then there is horse riding swimming Knitting and sewing etc. I am a home helper on Saturdays and Sundays that is when my shop is not open I go and help the old people I do their cooking for them and light a fire. I am very interested in home helping because then I never get bored going from house to house and so on. I am also a part timed hairdresser I do it at my own house and do not charge any money at all because they bring their own rollers hair setting lotion and clips and then I set it up and that, is that because that is how my life is led on.
