Two or three week ago we had the League Cup presented to us on eland road our home ground. We had drawn with Liverpool the week before 0-0 and then we played Nottingham forest and won 1-0 Mick Jones. was the scorer My name is [male name] [surname] I am married and have a baby boy I sometimes drink but do not smoke I think it is bad for your health. I live in Leeds in a flat. Right now I am fixing a partition up in the living room and making a playroom for [male name] the baby. The partition is getting along slowly for I am training a lit with the club. When I get bored with doing whatever I'm doing I play with the baby and help the wife do the washing up and help the wife do the washing up and other chores around around the hous I drive a car its a Ford Capri and the wife as a mini minor. The wife asn't passed her test yet so I take her on the roads and try my best to learn her how to drive she's already had a smash and I dont want her to have another I sometimes feel like warning the rest of the road that she's coming  Words: 253
