I am a Sports reporter, I report for the [newspaper]. I travel the country I have been to Spain, Germany and many other places. I watch all different sports, but mainly I report about football matches. I watch birds and their habits I always put some bacon rhine out and some coconut. I have a tree house were I watch the birds from. I belong to my towns football club. They play football matches every saturday. My firm I work for pay all my travelling expenses. In my kind of life it is all go. I go to the gymnasim some nights to do some training. We have weight lifting contests at our gymnasim sometimes but I don' t take part. Now I have to travel a bit more so the firm have supplied me with a firms car it is a sports car. Before I became a sports reporter I had to go to a daily school to learn to be a sports reporter.
