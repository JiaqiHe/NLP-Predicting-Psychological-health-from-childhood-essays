I am 25 years old.
When I am 25 years old I would like to be a model. A model travels to different places and there she models chlothes. Then after the girls have finished modeling the people that want to buy some of the chlothes go backstage.
      First a model has to go to a modeling school to learn how to Walk properly. After you Can Walk properly you must learn to balance. To balance properly you put about faur books on your head, and then five, and then six and if you can balance six books on your head and Walking the same time your a very good model.
      A model gets lots of money and sometimes if the chlothes are not needed some of the modles will get the chlothes.
      Before the models go on stage they have to put on some make up on because the light can make the face look pale. A model has a room of her own in that room she puts on her make-up to go with her gown o'r Whatever she is wearing. Some girls just model hats and some only model shoes and gloves.
      When I am a first class model I would like to model on a ship like the Queen Elizabeth the second. 
      On a Cruser ship you would model such things as bathing Costum, evening dress, day Cotton dress, and for the evenings a mink coat with a frilly white dress and socks and shoes to match.  Words: 251
