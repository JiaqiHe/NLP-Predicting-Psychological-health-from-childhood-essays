My course at [name of university] University was over so now I had to look for a job teaching Maths at a grammer school. I saw an advertistment in the paper advertising for a Maths teacher at [name of school] School. Liking the sound of this* school I decided to go there. After getting a letter of intruduction from the Proffessor, I wrote to my parents, informing them about my plans. I caught the train and was soon at [town]. When I reached the Grammer School I was interveiwed and accepted for the job. The first few days were very frustrating because I was unexperienced but, with the help of Mr [name], the Geography teacher I soon settled in There was a great band of understanding between him and me. After a few months we got married and we bought a little cottage in [village]. We travel to school every day together. We get about xxxx40 a week between us and are very happy. I have an exellant job and nearly every child I coach for their G.C.E examination in Maths passes This year no-one failed and fourteen people passed with honours. That made me* feel very proud Whenever I have any spare time I enjoy reading but that is not very often for I have to mark a lot of books. There were only a few thiings I wanted, a husband, a home and a car. Now* I have all these things My only regret is that I live a long way away form my parents and cannot see them very often. Apart from that I am the most satisfied person in the world.  Words: 275
