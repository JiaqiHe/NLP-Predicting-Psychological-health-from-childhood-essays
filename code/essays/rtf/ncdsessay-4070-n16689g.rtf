"I am now twenty five and I have joined the R.A.F. I am a test pilot and I enjoy my job. When I leave the R.A.F. I am going to work at an airport. One morning I was on a test flite when my aeroplane went out of control, so I eryected* out of my plane and come down safly by parachute a jeep come and took me back to the camp were my scwadron leader was waiting for me. I went into his office. He asked me what had happened and I said ""I was flying normaly when suddenly the plane started to shake, and it went into a dive."" The scwadron leader said ""do you now the corse of it"" and I said ""no"".
     That afternoon scientists were serching the plane to see if they could find the fott. A few hours later they did. Somebody had alterd the controls of the plane. There was a big meeting beetween the officers. Next week I was on leave. I went home to my family and told them all about what had happend. My wife asked me when I was leaving the RAF but I didnt now. A few months later I left. The R.A.F. had found the criminal and sent hmi to jail. I got a job at B.E.A. as an engineer. I made part of the jet of a Trident."  Words: 232
