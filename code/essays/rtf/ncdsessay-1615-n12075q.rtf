My name is [female name] [surname], I am 25 years old. I have a job in a large London store, I work in the department of childrens clothes, my salary is xxxx20 a week, it isn't much but I don't need much because I still live with my parents. I usually keep back some money to save. I usually leave the house at 9 o'clock and get to the store at 9.30. I have a cup of coffee at 11 o'clock and lunch at 1 o'clock. I start work again at 1.45 and go on until 5 o'clock when the store closes. I help clear up for half an hour and then get the train home. Its a very tiring day. On Wednesday I only work to the morning so I spend all afternoon window shopping and sometimes buying something. On Saturday I only work for the morning but I go straight home for lunch. 
Sometimes in the evening I go out, on Friday I go swimming, very occasionaly on Wednesday afternoon I go skating. On Monday evening I go Ten-pin bowling. But some evenings I just watch television or read.  Words: 191
