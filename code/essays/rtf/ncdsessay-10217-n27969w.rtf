I now live in a cottage in [county], within 15 minutes of [town] county town. I very often go camping, which I enjoy so much. Choosing a Job was difficult. I tried to become a conductor (the musical kind), but without any luck. My next try was to be a pilot, but that was'nt succsesful either. So I settled to take a Job as a courier. This Job gives me good money, and was easy to find. I had already got 'A' level's in French, German, Russian, Swiss, and Italien, and A,O'level's in Latin. I have now seen many places with 'World Coache's', Ankarra, Afghanistan, Africa, France, USA, and many other place's. I do many things in my spare time (when I get any, that is!) I go to scout's as an assistant as ofthen as possible. I teach boy's who are willing to learn the guitar. I play the guitar at club's, and the violin in the district ocheestra. I play feotball with my 2 son's and their friends as often as possible. living in Derby has giving me the choice of becoming a good climber. I now climb quite a bit, and have been on some climbing tour's. I play in goal for the local football club [football club]. [dale] is a dale more beutiful than any other of the [county] dales.
