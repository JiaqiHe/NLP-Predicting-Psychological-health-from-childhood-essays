----------------------
I cannot think what I might be doing at the age of 25. I am going to a Grammar school next term and I shall probably be there till I am 18 years old. then what I will do will depend on how well I do there.
When I am 25 I should have finished any training that I may have to do and I should be settled in a job.
I would very much like to be a police woman. I do not know how old I have to be but I expect about 18 or twenty years old, so by the time I am 25 I might have reached the rank of sergeant if I work hard. 
I expect you have to be fairly tall but as I am 5ft 1 ins now I expect I will be able to reach the height they want.
If I do become a police woman I know I shall not be living in [village] because we have no police women here, so I might find myself in any town where they use one.
I know this will be a tough and perhaps a dangerous life but I think I am tough enough to stand up to it. I should have learned things like Judo so I shall know how to defend myself against all thugs, escaped convicts or robbers.
I am sure my life will be very interesting and who knows I might marry a policeman.  Words: 240
