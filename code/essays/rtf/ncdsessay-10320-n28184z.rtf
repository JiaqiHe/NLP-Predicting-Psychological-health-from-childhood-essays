At the age of 25 I will be coming home from Universety. I am a B.A and I am hoping to teach at a university. I live in a small flat about a mile from the University. I have been married one year to a country girl. Each week I go for driveing lessons. The Tutor thinks Im a hopeless driver. Every thursday I go to pottery classes. Each evening after University I sit and study some times a fellow student comes to dinner. My wife is a superb cook and all the guests congratulate her after the meal.
As the year plods on I pass my driving test. Meanwhile we have flitted to a house in the country where I teach at the local school. But a month later I emigrate to Austrailia. There I renew my studies at the local university. At the weekends I go yachting in a yacht around the harbour. I also have a small Ham Radio transmiter.  Words: 162
