I would like, at the age of 25, to have a large game reserve in this country to show to the public. It would consist of animals from all over the world. I would like to study all of their activities. To get these animals I would go, with some helpers, and collect the animals when they are young. If it has a mother I would take her too. Another thing I would like to do with them is to paint pictures of them. I would also study vets and how they had sick animals so that I could have a surgery in which to heel the animals. If they had so much pain that it would be impossible to cure them I would put them to sleep, althoug I would regret it and do it reluctantly. Another thing I would like to have is my own yacht. I would try to form more orginisations like the R.S.P.C.A. and to form these, even if I have to work night and day and spend millions of pounds. I would pay scientists wages for experiments that would help the development of animals. I would also back groups like Oxfam. One thing I would not like and back would be experiments with weapons of war. Another subject I would like to keep as a thing of pleasure would be music. I would do a lot of gardening and goin in sports as well.  Words: 240
