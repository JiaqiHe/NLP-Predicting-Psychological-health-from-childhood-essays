I am twenty - five years old to-day . I am married and have two children . Every day I go to my work as an engineer . at 7 o'clock in the morning and return at 5 o'clock . Almost every Saturday I go to the football match to see my team . My two sons are 6 months and 1 year old . I love my job as an electronic engineer because I find it very interesting . I take my son to see the cartoons some Saturday afternoons while my wife takes the baby with her to the shops . I love steak and have it very often as my tea . Some nights I take my wife to the pictures while my mother watches the babies. To - day is Wednesday and as usual I get up for work . I ussually take eggs for my breakfast . My work is only a few miles away and I go in my Ford Cortina . I make the engines of cars and lorrys . When I come home I usually have a sleep on the chair . My house is a four apartment and it is bought . On Sundays I go out to my garden and do some work or go for a walk with the children in their prams . My hobby in my spare time is reading mystery books or going fishing . I go fishing quite often to a stream . I used to play golf but gave that up because I was not very good at it . My first job was working in a butchers shop but I gave that up once this job came along . Every day before I was working I used to go to the swimming baths every night because I loved swimming . I gave that up however because I don't have enough time . I am now getting older but I expect to have the same hobbies and job for the rest of my life .  Words: 341
