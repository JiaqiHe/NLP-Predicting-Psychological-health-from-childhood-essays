I am now 25 years of age, and I am going to be a sailor. I am going to have a boat of my own. And have a house as well as a boat. I shall have a three freinds living with me. I went to see if I could rent and house for a couple of years. And I asked the person in charge if I could rent a house for a couple of years and he said I could, then he showed me the place on the map where the house was. Then we both went round to see the house then I said it was a good house, So a couple of ours later I went to get a boat at a boatyard and they manager showed me all the boats and I picked out a good one. Then paid for the boat then I went away. Then after that I went and bought some wallpaper and paste. Then I went back to the house to paper the rooms. After a couple of day the house was papered my freinds and I moved in. Every day we went fishing and had fish for tea. and they all had a happy live together. I worked on a boat for a living and got a good pay  Words: 218
