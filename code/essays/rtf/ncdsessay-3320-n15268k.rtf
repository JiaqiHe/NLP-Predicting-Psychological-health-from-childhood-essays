I am now twenty five years of age. I have a wife and two children. The house I live in has two bedrooms. Down stairs are two rooms and a kitchen which has presently had an electric cooker. The job I have as a footballer is alright, but I am giving it up at the age of thirty one. I do not smoke and occacionely I go out to a club. Also I do not gamble. Sometimes I gave a go at the football pools, but I haven't won anything yet. I go to night school three times a week. In some of my spare time I train on the track down the road. I have a car, and it is called an Anglia. It has four seats. and when I have finished I drive it into the garage and paddlock the steering wheel. We have plenty of friends. One of my freinds plays for our team. The childrens names are [name] and [name].  Words: 164
