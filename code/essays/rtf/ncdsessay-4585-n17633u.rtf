when I woke up in the army camp I heard the rumbling of tanks. and sudenly I remberded that eh Austrailians were comeing to help us fihgt the Japs. then I heard some planes in the distence they sounded like zero's so I sounded the Alarm. minutes later ALL the british, Amicran and Austrailan men were maning the guns by this time you could see the* markings on their wings but to are horrer we saw they were bomers seconds later every man was in the Tanks and Truks and geting out of the camp while bombs came thundering all around us but no man got hurt and when we had reached the Jungle we stoped. to go back to home for we had not much fuel left. Now in the year 1994 all was peacefull the men properly trained given enough food and had plenty of Amo and are very healty.  Words: 152
