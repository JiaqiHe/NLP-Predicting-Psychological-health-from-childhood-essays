I would like to be a Air Hostest when I leave school and want a job. I would have to learn a lot of different langueges but I do not mind. I would like to get married at the age of twenty three or round about then . When I have my wedding I do not want a large weding I want a small wedding . When we are just married, I would like to live in a flat. Then if I get any children I would like to get a house and be a housewife. I would go to night clubs and enjoy myself before I get any children. I would play tennis keep up swimming . When we get married I would give up a air hostess and maybe become a school teacher . I do not want more than four children when I get married, because it would be to much to cope with. I would like to be an air hostess because I like flying, and I would like to be a school teacher because a like young children . I hope whoever I marry is not going to be a coalminer, a dustmen man and a lawyer. I would not live on a main road when I get children because I would like my children to play free without busy road's. I do not want to posh a house because everybody will thing we are rich.
