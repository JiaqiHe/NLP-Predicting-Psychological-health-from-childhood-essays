When I am 25 I will probably be married. I will try and go to medical college to become somehting to do with doctors. I may emigrate to canada and make my fortune over there. My intention is not to live in a council house and would rather own my own . I want to settle down and have a steady and decent job. I wish to live a steady and adventurous life. When I have a job which isn't very great I will look around for a better job. I want a shady flow of a pu* coming in weekly. I will probaly want to build cabinets and attachments. I will have a family car and telephone. I will go a broad annually with the family . When the election season comes I will probably not know for whom to vote  Words: 142
