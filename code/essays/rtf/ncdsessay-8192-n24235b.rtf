If all my plans go acording to plan, at 25 years of age I would like to be a draftsman at [company] in [town]. I tuse this job becauce you have a good chance to get on in life. For instance what chance have you got to get on in life if you worked in a factory or as a brick layer. But if I couldn't be a draftsman I'd like to be a gas fiter, mainly because you traval about the area you live in and meet people. When I'm twenty five I should be marred. I my self would like to live in a cottage in the country. On satereday afternoons I mite go to a football match or go fishing.  Words: 123
