My work that I am doing an is Nursing. I am a childrens nurse. I have two children of my own. One of them is only a baby and the other one is about 2 years old. I live in a small cottage. The cottage has two rooms and three bedrooms. We have a small bath room up stairs. We have a big garden. In the middle of the garden is a lawn for the children. I have lots of interest in my house work and sewing. The age of my baby is about 16 months. she is a big baby. If any of my children are ill I can make them a bit better. My house work kepts me busy for a bit. I have some time for reading books. When I am at work I ask some one if they would look after my children. My husband works on a farm. Some times he looks after the children. I have some days off so I can look after our children. I have a shed which I keep my tools and other things I need for the garden. A nurse comes and looks after my children. My mother and father come to see us some times. On Sundays we go out for the day. We have a car so we take my mother and father out for a day too. Some times I work at nights.  Words: 237
