I live in a flat with my friend. I am a State Enrolled nurse. Today I am looking after small children, between the age of 4 and 6 years of age. After work tonight I am going to the local youth centre. My husband is a long distance lorry driver and is hardly ever at home. When I come home from the youth centre I shall read a book then go to bed. The next morning, when I woke up I found a letter for me, it was from my husband. He said in the letter that he would be coming home tonight, I was very pleased to her this. Work that day was just the same as usual. When I arrived home that night I cooked a meal fit for a King. My husband arrived home and was very pleased to see me again, I was glad to see him as well. The next day I had a days holiday so my husband and myself went roller skating and then swimming. We went to a chinese resturant for our dinner, then went home. My husband had to leave again that afternoon. I saw him off then went back inside. I decided to go visit my mother in hospital. When I arrived at the hospital my mother cried because she was so glad to see me again. We had a long talk and then I was time for me to go home again. That when my flat mate arrived home from her officce job we had tea and talked for quite along time about this and that. My flat mate said that she was going to meet her boyfriend tonight. When she went that night I sat back in a chair and read a book until I fell fast asleep.  Words: 300
