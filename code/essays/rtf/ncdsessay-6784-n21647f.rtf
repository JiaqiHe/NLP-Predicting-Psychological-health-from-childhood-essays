I would like to be a Teacher and I would like to teach in Room 1. At home when we get holidays I would like to do the work then just sit down I'd like to live in a bunglow so that I don't need to go up and down stair's. I'd like to go swimming and train to be a good athleat and try to do some work so to help the children and give them good education. The best thing I'd like to do is swim just to help my swimming. When I went back to school I would have a new class and I'd have to start all over again but I think it would be good. I'd have a good life and not needing a doctor. I would also be married and I would just like to have one child which I'd like it to be a boy. I'd like my home to be nice and I'd like a dog and a horse which would be called the dog Mandy, and the horse Smokey and in years to come I'd like the dog to have pupies and after that I'd like to have a cat which would not fight with the dog if I was lucky! If I was training to be an thlect I'd have to get a track suit a pair of spikes and the things the runners start of with and I hope I will be a good runner and as good High jumper and a good long jumper. I'd like to swin in the sports and even get in for the olimik games and thing's like that to win and get medles and cups for the ream I was running in and for the school and for other different things*. I even might go to foriegn lands and run for Britain.  Words: 309
