I am a qualified teacher. I teach in London at the moment I am teaching in [London suburb]. I teach at a primary school, and school hours are between 9.00 and 4.00. My class is a fourth year class there are 30 children 16 girls and 14 boys. I do not take my class for either history or Geography. I take a third and second year class as well as my own for mathamatics. (at different times.) At home I like making special recipes. I have made a new kind of sweet caled a Scrooge. I made 100 of them and gave two each to all my pupils and they liked them. I live with my best friend [female name] in a flat in [London suburb]. Anoinette and I make a lot of Scrooge sweets and sell them for sixpence a bag. At school I take my class for p.t but not for games. (there is a proper games teacher for that. My friend [female name] is also twenty five. She is a blonde she has brown eyes and her hair is long.  Words: 183
