If I were twenty five I would like to have a car. Probaly an 'Anglia'. I would get married and would try to find a house in the country. Not a big one but one with a big garden with a nice lawn. I would work at a large firm with a job in an office. I would not like a cold job in a mill. I think I would go to night clubs and pubs. I would not smoke and my wife would have to be nice. I would like two children. Boy and girl named Peter and Carol. Maybe I would have something in the bank. I would still play football (as I do now) and I would go to football matches. When I had enough money saved up I would go on holiday to Rome or America. If I had to go to a place on the British coast I would go to the Isle of Man. I would not forget my mother and father. I would take them to places in England in my Anglia. My hobbies would be coins and stamps I would like my wife to have brownish hair and blue eyes.  Words: 198
