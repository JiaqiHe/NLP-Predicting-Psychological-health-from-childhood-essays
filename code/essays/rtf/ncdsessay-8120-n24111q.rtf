I Am Now Twenty Five Years Old      I have now finished my several years of training. Now I can call myself a propaly qualified Physiotheraphist. I have just been married this month. My husband takes me to work every morning in the car. I work at the [name of hospital] hospital in Newcastle. We live two miles out of Newcastle in a little village. We are both interested in walking and seeing places. Usually we go in the forests in the county side and pick wild flowers. Sometimes we see dear running through the trees or we see squirrels in the tree tops. Other times we would go riding in the hills and take a meal with us for our lunch. I think we enjoy riding the most it is more fun. On Sundays my mother and father come to see us. We take them for a run in the afternoon, and stay out for tea. Or we sometimes have friends. My work is very interesting indeed. Sometimes people do not stay very long for treatment. Others stays for a year or so. I get very friendly with some of them and I get very frinedly with other physiotheraphists. We sometimes have them for a meal and talk, about lots of different things.  Words: 213
