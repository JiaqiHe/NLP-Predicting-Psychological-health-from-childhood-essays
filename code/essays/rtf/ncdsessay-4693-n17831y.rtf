In the mornings I get up and dress the Children then I get something for their break-fast and see them of to school. When they are gone I always wash up clean the kitchen and sweep up. Then hoover the other rooms and bedrooms. After that wash all the dirty washing and iron them. At half past eleven I get the dinner ready for the children when they come home. After finishing see them off to school again tidy up the kitchen and wash up again. Towards the end of the afternoon go out to the shops and see what to get for tea and for tomorrows dinner. When I get back put the kettle on for the children for a cup of tea so it is ready for them. When my husband come in I cook his tea and make him comfortable with a cusion behind his back. After I put the children in bed I wash up again then sit down and knit or wash television.  Words: 168
