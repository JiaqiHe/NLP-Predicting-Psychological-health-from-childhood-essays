Interesting results from being a scientist that's what Im going to be (at the age of 25). World famous for curing a diesease which no man has every done or making a invention which no man has ever done. This could be very hard so many scientists have people who help him. First of all I will study it from books which deal in the scientific world, this would be better than listening to a boring lectuire which most people have found out. The scientific world is dealing with lots of chemicals and most be would thinks thats lots of fun but it can be very dangerous thats why in December 25th 1969 (christmas) I will be having a Chemistry set and I will study the leaflet first like anybody else. The idea have Chemistry isto discover things which You will find. I will not get married at twenty five for I would think I should study chemistry first. I won't be extremely rich by that I me a millionare (or billionare) that will spoil you. I will get a car or motor bike for that will save me going on a train or bus for at least 2 Years and You have to get a fare of ** 5s-6s each day.  Words: 212
