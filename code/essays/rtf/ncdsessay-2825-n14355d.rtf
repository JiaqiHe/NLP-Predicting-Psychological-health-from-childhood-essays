I would like to be married and have children. Every spare time I have I would go to fishing contests and also play tennis. For my job I would like to be a racing driver and in my other spare time I'd take my children out to play at the parks and when they get older I'd take them fishing if they wanted to and buy them some fishing tackle for them selves. For my holiday I would go abroad like I do now. I would go on my holiday on a plane. I would also teach my children how to swim and take them swimming every week. I would have some dogs and other animals for pets. I would also like to breed golden laberadors the dogs. If I could afford it I would by a shop and make it into a pet shop.  Words: 145
