I am a nurse and work in a hospital, I live with my mother and father in [town]. We run the house together but my mother does most of the housework and cleaning when I am at work. But I do some when I come home. The hospital I work in is called [hospital name] Hospital. It is a very good one and I enjoy working there. I like to go to the nurse's club on Friday night we have a good time and I enjoy it very much. At nights, after I have done my work I like to spend a hour or so at seting or read for a bit. My mother and I enjoy sewing and dressmaking and we help each other, with our work. I sometimes write to my Auntie [female name] she used to be a sister at [hospital name] Hospital in [town]. I like to go for a walk on Sundays, and pick some flowers and take a photo of the river. My mother and father like to ocme with me and to enjoy the countryside.  Words: 182
