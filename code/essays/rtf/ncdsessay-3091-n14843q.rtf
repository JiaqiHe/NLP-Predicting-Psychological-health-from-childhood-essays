My main interest is coin collecting and my job is a computer programmer I ahve a Jaguar Each day except saturday and sunday I travel 5 1/2 miles to work. I earn a lot of money and I am quite rich. Every 6 months we go to the sea for a fortnight. At home at weekends we go to the river to fish and to have a picnic. If it rains we help the children do jigsaw puzzles. There is a stream running through our garden where the children often play We keep a dog he is now 13 he is called peter he is a fox Terrier I hardly ever get bored and I am seldom unhappy I work from 9am* till 12.45 pm then I have my lunch then from 1.30 pm to 6. pm. , and I have many freinds at work. I hope my children will get the same job as me.
