----------------------
Now I am a chef in the [hotel] in [city] there is only one person working there and that is me. At home I still carry on with my hobbies. Now I have some real friends to go places with and I hope I shall be forever with them. At home I lead an interesting life I do the cooking and most of my own housework. I am very Interested in cycling When I have spare time I go cycling. I have already gone In for several cycling races. Now I am getting better at racing I will go in for more and more races.
I also do lots of swimming on saturdays and Sundays. I have won two or three races and hope to wime many more races. While I work at the [hotel] I get to know more people which I think is a good thing. At home I have to do some paper work for the manager etc. At home I mostly relax and carry out my hobbies. On at least the three nights a week another chef takes my place as I often have go out. At the moment I lead a happy hard-working and easy going life compared to some of my other real friends, who work I banks shops etc... I still live with my mother and father as I would never leave them for the world (at least not yet for a long time). I think that I will stay with my job for a long time scince I have such a nice position.  Words: 260
