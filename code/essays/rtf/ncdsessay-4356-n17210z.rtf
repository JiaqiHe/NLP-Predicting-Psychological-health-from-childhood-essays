Twenty four years of my life has passed now, and I am living an ordinary life. You might say I'm the type of person who you'd meet in the street, or in some other ordinary place. I am a wife and a mother, and I live in a quaint little house. I love reading and writing and caring for my children. While at school I had always wished to become someone famous, a politoican or an authoresss perhaps, but they were only wishes I had a good education and at the age of nineteen I began writing books about people and their ways, I still do, but I am an average authoress, not one who people know all over the country. I enjoy listening to people's ideas and thoughts, and from this I write articles and books. I love nature and the wonders of the world. My children are growing rapidly, and their games and ideas interest me. To them nothing matters, the sun is like a small golden ball of fire, and the grass is green and soft. Little do they know of the importance of the sun and rain, flowers and trees. I hope that when they are married they will treasure these wonders, like myself.  Words: 208
