When I was younger than I am now I used to do all different things. But now x. When I was 17 years old I got a driving licence that lasted for quite a long time and took lessons and passed a test. Now I have a motor car and go out at times. I do not always go out but I go and do all the shopping that we need. I also do most of the house work such as tidying up, dusting, and sometimes get the dinner ready. I am going to try to get a job somewhere so I can earn some money. Sometimes when I go out I go to the pictures to go and see a film. Afert a few days I had sent away for a job I got I reply to say that I'd got it, the value was £25 a week so I took it and started work the next week. I travelled there in my motor car every day. The time [illegible] of the job was from 8am to 10pm. One night while I was driving home a man came and knocked me over, his car has had a nasty bump on and mine was very badly damaged. I was injured but he was alright so he got an ambulane to come and pick me up and take me to a hospital. Soon I recovered and I was alright after that I bought a new motor car and carried on with the job.  Words: 252
