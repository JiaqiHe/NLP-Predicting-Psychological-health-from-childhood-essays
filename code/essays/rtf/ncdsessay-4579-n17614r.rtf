I am 25 years old and my job is a police man I neerly alway direct traffic. but in my spare time I improve the house by doing odd jobs in it. My hobby wich I have is restoring vintage cars I like thes cars becauise they are a lot more reliable than the modern cars of today My wife is a nurse in a hospital near our house I lead a farly normal life my house is a two bedroomed house but we do not use one of the rooms I go to work in a my car wich is a green viva car the police Station that I work at is a large one. Before I became a fully trained policeman I had to join the cadets I had to do lots of training including how toi drive the first lesson that I had was learning the foot pedals and after that I took my first driving test first I put it into nutrel then I Started the engine I put it into first gear looked into my mirror and Started off after I had finished the drive I was told that I had completed and passed my driving test and then I was a fully trained police man I enjoy my work very much indeed after a while I found out that now I can drive I might as well buy myself a car and that was when I brought my car. I bought it at a garage near my house for 350 pounds new and that is how I got my car  Words: 266
