My name is [male name] [surname], and I am now 25 years old. I am not married and I live in a house with my parents. I have just finished a course at collage, and I am now starting work at a research centre. I am hoping soon to be on the board of directors because then I would have a rise of salary, and a better job. When I have saved enough money I am going to buy a house. My work at the moment mainly involves sitting at a desk in my office and working out the research centre financial strategy. At night I usely stay at home and finish of some work that I have not been able to finish of in the day. Then I sit back and watch T.V., or play one of my instruments. At weekends I usely go out somwhere in my car. My car is the latest out and was brought for me by the reaseatch center. It could go 1,400 killometers a hour. It cost the firm over xxxx1,000. This weekend I am going to take my parents out into the country. I have got a sister called [female name]. she has recently to a mr T. [surname]. When I retire I will get a good pension. Then I will be able to relax from my work.  Words: 226
