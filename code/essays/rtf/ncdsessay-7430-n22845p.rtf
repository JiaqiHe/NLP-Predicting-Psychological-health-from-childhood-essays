I have decided to be an auctioneer, of antiques and coins as I am interested in that line of work. I first of all thought of being a vett, but found the examination was long and dificult. Now I find antiques very interesting and pleasant, I collect antiques my self as a hobby, and make a very fine income. I have a shop looked after by my two colleagues who are very fine friends of mine.
      I live in a semi detached house with my mother and pet alsation.  Words: 89
