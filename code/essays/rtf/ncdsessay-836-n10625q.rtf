"When I am twenty-five I would like to be a fully qualified nurse I would carry on nursing till I was twenty seven. If you have not got any O levels or A levels you can still be a nurse but not a qualified nurse you can be a State Enroled nurse (S.E.N.)
One day as I was looking after my pateints in ward six a man shouted to me in a croaky voice and said he felt very ill, I told the matron and she helped me to put a screen round his bed and then she told me to send for a doctor. After the doctor had looked at him he said there was nothing wrong with him and walked away leaving me wondering what could the mysterious pains be caused by. The matron told me to take good care of him. 
Day after day he kept on calling for help then I noticed somthing, every day he always called at the same time which was 10 oclock A.M. I went to his mothers house and she said ""every ten years at ten oclock for a week he always has pain which the doctor says is caused by a disease called Onduria* but they would not tell me what is really was"".
When I got back to the hospital I told the nurse which worked with me. and then in my spare time I go to the pictures with my boy friend and go to dances. we have a four day week for working and penty of time off for holidays I encouraged my friend to become a state enroled nurse she was very bored before she became a nurse now she enjoys life and goes on a holiday abroad with me every year."
