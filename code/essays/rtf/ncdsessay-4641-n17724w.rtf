I am a capt. of the merchant navey and I live in GHana. I have a wife and about five children. I would work for cargo like oil sand or grain. Then I would send money over to where my mum and dad live and so that They can live near me in Ghana. The rout the boat will take is London to Ghana. Then I would change to Ghana to china. So I will not be board with the job. I will be a kind dad and let my children on boad sometimes. When it is time to leave when I am about 55 I will go to the live boat station that is nearest to me. Then I will try and get a big boat for the family and do quite alot of sailing together. After I will go back to London where I was born for the last 20-30 years. The house where I live in in Ghana will be by the sea, at a place called Cape coast. were there is a lot of gold. I will have some sort of light house for the heat but strong for the heavy rain. There will be parm trees and a live boat station near by. I will by a car for my wife so she can take the children to school or uptown I will not drive never. The car will be a car come van. ANd I will not spoil my children like some people do.  Words: 250
