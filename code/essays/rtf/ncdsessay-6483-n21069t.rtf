I decideed to become an engineer after I left school. I have a fairly large house which has, unfortunately, a rather small. I have not yet married, but I might do soon. Having a wife might have advantages but is has also a lot of disadvantages. My chief interest is an extremely large model railway, which I have on a large board. The whole railway can be folded up to the wall when not in use and thereby saves space. I do a fair amount of work with my own hands, such as building cupboards. I have to do a large amount of work that women usually do, which can be extremely boring. At work I have often to oil or take apart machines which are not working properly. I work from 8.30a.m. to 5p.m. and I have a fast car for getting into town quickly. I have a rather unpleasent boss and we often have arguments. I get paid xxxx20 a week, which is sufficient to keep me going. Apart from engineering at work, I have a lot of work which involves engineering. I frequently have to mend the motor of my 22 year old Hornby 0-6-2 tank engine Less often, but still quite frequently I have to mend a Hornby diesel and  a Triang-Hornby 4-6-2 locomotive which are 19 and 16 years old respectively.
