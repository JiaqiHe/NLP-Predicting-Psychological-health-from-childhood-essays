When I am 25 years old I would liked to be married and to have some children. If I hadn't had any children I would carry on with nursing. I like nursing because you mett different people every day. Being a nurse is very interesting you find things out every day. If I had children I would give up nursing and look after them until they were in the junior school, then I would go back to my nursing. When I come home from the hospital in the evening and the children are in bed I would do some sewing or knitting. If I had a lot of letters to write I would write them in the evening and post them on the way to the hospital in the morning. On Saturday evenings we might take the children to the cinema if there was a good film on. We would have a dog and it would be called Bell. Bell would be a golden Labrodor. The nieghbour would look after him in the day and we would take him for a country walk every Sunday  Words: 185
