My name is **** I am 25 years old. I work in a post office each day I leave my house a quarter to nine. when I get to work I put my lunch box in a locker and start work. In the post office there are quite large amounts of money so you have to be very trustworthy. I sometimes forget were things are because there are so many things such as postal orders, stamps, telegrams, and licenses. My interests at home are swimming which I do quite alot of, model making with Airfix* models and Lego, and I like gardening. I am not married yet so I cook for myself. I lead a life of interests.
