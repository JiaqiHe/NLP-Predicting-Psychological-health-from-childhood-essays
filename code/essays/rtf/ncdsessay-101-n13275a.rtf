I am now a vet and I am going to tell you what happened when I was in surgery. There was about twelve people and they all wanted their animals put to sleep. But instead of that I sent them to be sold again. At home I do a lot of things I collect stamps and coins. I also still have my budgerigar Dinky to look after if it is a nice day I might go for a long walk for I love walking. I might cook the dinner for mum and help her doing her work. I think I will lead a very interesting life. I will probably have a dog if we live in the country. I will take it for walks.  Words: 124
