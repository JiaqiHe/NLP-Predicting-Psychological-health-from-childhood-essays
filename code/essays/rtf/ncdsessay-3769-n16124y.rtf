In the holidays I like to go riding on my bike. I like to rid to places like (place) with friends. When we get to (place) we walk along to the laek. At the lock we go Fishing for ils. Some dinner times when my mum is not in the house I have to open a tin of beens and sausages or a tin of soup. If I felt very hungary I just make my self a omalat or a boildegg.
