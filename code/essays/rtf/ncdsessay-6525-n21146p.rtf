Yesterday it was my birthday and my age is now twenty five years. My birthday is [month] [day] and I was born in the year 1958. I have lots of hobbies one of them is flying model earcraft some of them are remote control. My most favourite hobby is photography. Sometimes I go down to [town] to help my nan for she is getting very old indeed. My work is at [company name] co, limited they are a very good firm to work with our salery is about 65 pounds a month this is not a bad salary so I think I will stay with [company name]. I am thinking of getting married when I am about thirty.
If I get married I go back to live in [town] it is a nice little town but now all the street lamps are all swiched on by computer.  Words: 146
