When I am 25 years old I might want to run stables and take riding lessons and looking after the horses. Also if I don't take people on rides I might stay behind and do some work. In my spare time like sunday afternoons I might work on my dads farm but mostly I will hope to spend most of my life with horses alot, and taking them to shows or show jumping. if I get married I might have some children and learn them to ride and alot of things to. Most of my life is to do with farm work and a lot on horses . if I do do some farm work I would like to milk the cows. Though I also want to feed the hens and chicks. If I do get married I want to marry a man who loves horses like I do and likes children to. I hope to have one boy and two girls. I also like stamp-collecting and fishing. When I am just going up to 25 years old I will start taking driveing lesson or if not I might take it when I am 19 or 18 years old  Words: 199
