I work in an office in town. I am a Secretary to the manager of a very important firm. I do Short hand typing and lots and lots of other important things. I go into the office at 8 o'clock in the morning and finish my work at 6 o'clock in the evenings. In the evenings I go to clubs and dances. I am not yet married. At home I live with my Mum and Dad and my sister. I have a brother who is married and have two children. My brother lives in the country with his wife and children. My sister is nineteen and she is engaged. I go swimming a lot with my sister and her boyfriend. I like listening to 'pop' music, I like sewing I make all my own clothes. I have a very happy life.
