My name is [name]. I left school when I was 18, and went to [city] University to study plants because I wanted to be a landscape gardener. I was a t University for three years. I **** from home to [city] every day, they closed the station down in my home village so this made traveling very expensive but I managed, my farther worked at the University as well and sometimes we went in the car. I was at University for three years then I got my degree as a fully qualified landscape gardener. Allthough I had got my degree I found getting work very hard because I was a girl, it was about three months before I was given a contract to deisin a very big garden, it took a few monthsto finish the garden but when I did finish the owner was very pleased and told a few friends about it and I got quite a lot more contracts. That was four years ago and now I have a big house in London and I am quite well known. I have not got a very big garden at my house because I have not got time to keep it tidy for I spend so much time on other peoples gardens.  Words: 212
