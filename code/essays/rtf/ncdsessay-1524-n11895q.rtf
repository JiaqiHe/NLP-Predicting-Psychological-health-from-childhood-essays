When I am 25 I would like to own a riding stable so that I could go hunting, and go to competitions. I would also like a big house wht a small swimming pool so that I could go swiming in the summer. When I got bored at my house I would go abroad and find out everything. I would mostly go to canada, Australia, and switzerland. If I got married I would go back to my house and settle there. I would only have a few small hobbies like swimming, coin collecting, and stamp collecting. I would use up my spare time by going and helping my parents, and visiting my freinds and my brother and sister.  Words: 118
