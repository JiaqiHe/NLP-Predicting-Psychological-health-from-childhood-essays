I am now 25 years of age and I have just left Edinburgh Dental hospital and I am now a fully qualified Dentist. Tomorrow which will the 25th October I will be travelling home to [town] by train to see my parents. There I will be working with my father in his practice. I left Edinburgh in the early morning. When I arrived home I went straight to my parents house they both were very pleased to see. Later on I bought myself a house near [village] in the country which is very nice and I am near some small lanes for walking down and through the fields. One of my interests is photography and when I go for a walk down this small lane I sometimes take my camera with me and take some photographs of trees and other ones which bloom in the summer. Then I develope the pictures in a dark room by myself and nearly always the come out well. Also another interest of mine is cycling and there is some lovely places where you can cycle.  Words: 181
