It was early morning, I woke up and dressed, I was living in the isle of Whight and My Work was teaching, This morning Seemed unusually bright and gay as though something exciting was going to happen I then remembered that it was the beginning of the Whitsen holidays. I ran down stairs and cooked breakfast I had egg and bacon and a Mushroom. I then went up stair to fetch my costume as it was a warm day I decided to go skiing I met Alan there and he took me out for a quick run. My Other intrest was swimming. My home life was quiet as I wasn't yet married but engaged. My fianca Alan and myself had a week of gala's and skiing championships. The week had passed very quickley and I was now back at work. My class were very obediant and were unusyally quiet so I decided for a treat, to go to the beach to collect crabs, shells, stones and more exciting sea life.
That night was cold so I lite the fire and curled up in a chair to read a book. My life was quiet. Only sometimes did I go out and enjoy myself.
My Interests were swimming and sking and had won cups, medals and certificates. I had so many that I could just about put them in my case.
I enjoyed my work only sometimes did I get fed up and that was usually when the children were excited and woulden't concentrate on their work.  Words: 252
