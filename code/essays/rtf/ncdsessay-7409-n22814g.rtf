I am now twenty-five. I have been married and have left collage. I live in a small cottage away from the main road. I had got a job that was not far from where I lived. My husband was a scientist and I was a mathematition. We hadn't any children for we had only been married a couple of months ago. My husband was three years older than I was. We had a small cottage for it was easy to keep clean. We were out early every morning excetp Saturday and Sunday.
At the moment my husband had discovered a way to cure certain illnesses like T.B and polio. Life was quiet easy* untill I had a baby boy. So I had to leave my job to look after him. We decided to name him from a name from the bible. We named him [male name]. after that time seemed to fly for soon he was walking and nearly talking.  Words: 159
