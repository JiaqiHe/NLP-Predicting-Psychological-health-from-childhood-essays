When I am 25 I will be working as a short hand typeist in an office I hope it to be over Westminster. I hope to be married with two children. I wish to be able to drive a sports car. I want to be able to watch televishion some of the time. I want to be able the take my children out nearly every weekend. I would like to work from nine o'clock to about four or five oclock. I would like to live over Westminster near my work.  Words: 90
