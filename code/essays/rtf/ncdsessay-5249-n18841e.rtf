After passing my O levels and A levels, I had found a very good job. I had joined the air-force at 25 years old. It took 18 months training, but to-day was my big day. I had to fly and take charge of an F-4B PHANTOM 11. The Phantom is one of the most fastest and advanced aircraft in the world. I climbed into the cockpit, with a mass of switches and controls, surrounding me. I turned on the engines, and at high speed along the runway I lifted her from the air. There was no noise only of jets engines.  Words: 101
