When I am twenty five I hope to be just leaving an agricultural collage, and finding a job as a farmer, in England if I can, if I can't I will fly over to Australia, and find a job as a sheep farmer. I f I find a job as a farmer in England, I will be a farmer with my friend [name], who is a farmers son. His * grand father has a farm at [town], he lives their with his mother and grandfather. We will run a sheep farm, and have one cow, for our milk, we will also have hens and sheep*. We* will put the sheep on the fells to graze, in the pastures*, and dip them in disinfectant about twice a year, to get* all the fleas and tics out of the wool. If we have about eight hundred sheep, I think that would be enough, and when the lambing season comes, the more lambs the better, so that we can sell some of the older sheep, and make money of their meat and their wool. We would also have a few fields for grain, and hay and silage. We would have about three tractors and two landrovers, one condine harvester*, and a baler, trailer, a seed sowing machine, and a lot of other instruments. The hills wouldn't have to be to steep, and jagged.  Words: 230
