I lieft college at 18 and joined the police cadets. I passed the test and now am a part time policemen in Southampton on, Sundays Saturdays, Fridays, and Wednesdays. I am on traffic duty some of the time and on Sundays I work behind the desk. I had always wanted to be a police man since I was young. I live in the police hostel and have a bedroom lounge and kitchen to my-self. In my spare time I would collect coins. I would specialise in pennies as I have quite a collection of coins which I have seved since I've been 10 years old. Joey, my pet budgerigar which I had on the 20th May 1969!
