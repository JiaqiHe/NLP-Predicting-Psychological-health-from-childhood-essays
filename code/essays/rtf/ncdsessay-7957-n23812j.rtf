When I am 25 I will go and get a job. The job I will get is a senist. If I will be a senist I will all about how people get killed and how people get killed by gas.
Sometimes some people kill there self and it is really true. At home when I am not doing nothing I does get my library book and read it. After I have finished my reading I will write about all defant poems all about winter, spring, and summer.
At home I like to do homework. Sometimes some of our family do the washing up or sweep the floor 
Anytime at home I like a job fopr anybody at all.  Words: 116
