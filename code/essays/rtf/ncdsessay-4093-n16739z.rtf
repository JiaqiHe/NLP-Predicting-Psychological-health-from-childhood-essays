I still give all my spare money and time on stamps. I'v got a small car and dreams of becoming a stamp dealer, the same dreams I had when I was 11 years old. I go to College and I am thinking of leving this term because I have saved up anuff money to rent a small shop for my ambition. (A stamp dealer, of course, I'm mad on stamps since I was small.) I m lucky to have a car and be able to rent a shop, becuase of working part time in a stamp dealers shop and now my own shop only renting till I gett going and make profits to buy this shop off the man I am renting it.
