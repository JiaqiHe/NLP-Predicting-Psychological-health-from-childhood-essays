My name is [female name] [surname] and I am a dog trainer. My life, working as a dog trainer is quite hard I began to train when I was eighteen, and realised that the blind needed a guide dog to help them, also I had always an interest in animals especially dogs.
I live in a flat at London and go to work by tube every day exept Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday I work in my brothers shop, and after the shop is closed I clean it up. I have three dogs and two cats. Although I am a dog trainer, I have an interest in hockey, needle-work and net ball. On Saturday nights I go to a dancing club and sometimes I go to a different club. My working hours are from 8am to 6p.m. My job is not always pleasant because I sometimes get a bit from one of the dogs.  Words: 153
