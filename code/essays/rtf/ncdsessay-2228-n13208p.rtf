My name is (name) I am 25 years old . I have liked the army which I have been in for 4 1/2 years now I am a sargent , when I first joined I was doing marching nearly all the time  now I am driving tanks , swiming climbing and a lot more good things. I am up at 7am every morning bed at 9.30. P.M. When i got home for my holidays , I got a big welcome home party and when i got back to the army I got a big lot of marching. I have won three medals and one cup. The cup is for winning a gala and two of the medals for the same thing and the other medal for winning a cross country run . I once broke my leg when I did a parachute jump from a plane. I am just about the best shot in the camp I have a knife, machine-gun, rifle . I once got three weeks in jail for striking an officer because he called me a pig.  Words: 180
