When I am 25 years old I would like to get married and have children. I am insideright for Manchester Utd, I have to travel 20 mile to get there in my car and it is a blue consul. I live in a houe in the countryside, downstairs it has four rooms and upstairs it has 5 rooms. In my spare time I work in the garden and play with my children teaching them football. All so in my spare time we go in the car to have a day in the part, but some days I go and practice for a game on ** Saturday. We trein about 5 hours then into the showers, before I come home I take some of my mates home I take 5 of them and somtimes we go to the pup. I dont drink to much beer because of the Bearthalise test, then I go home and at night when the children are sleep me and the wife go out at night and come back at 10. to 11.  Words: 176
