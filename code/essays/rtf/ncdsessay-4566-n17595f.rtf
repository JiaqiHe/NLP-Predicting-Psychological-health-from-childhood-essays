I am now 25 and am living in a bungalow by my self. Although I go to work I still have time to do alot of housework and keep the garden weedless.
My main intrest in housework is cooking and I have already passed two tests on that subject I live at the edge of [town] so I am not often disturbed.
Three times a week I go to visit my mother and father at [town]. I don't see alot of my sister though as she lives at [town]. For a year now I have been a guider to the guides of [town]. We meet each Friday at seven o'clock in the town hall. In five weeks time we are going to a guide camp in Somerset. Each year a camp is held in different counties we are hopping it will be held in Cornwall. next year.
My job, a P.E. instructor helps me to slep well as I often have to demonstrat what I am trying to make them do. I teach children from the age of 5 to 15.
In the evenings when I have done all the housework I like to sit in the garden (only in summer though) and knit. In winter I usaly sit indoors by a warm coal fire. 
I still wear glasses as I did when I went to school. Though they still ar'ent any better now than when they were then. On Saturday evenings I go to a dance with [female name] [surname] a girl I us't to now in School [female name] lives two miles away but I still see her every day as she helps me run the gimnasam.
Although I do alot each day I enjoy the life I lead.  Words: 286
