I am know at the age of 25. My favourite interests know are reading, sewing, knitting and gardening. I am married and have 2 children. My home life is very dull because I have not very many friends round where I live. A am a secretary in an office. I have a lot of things to do. We have a dog, hamster and a goldfish we are thinking of going abroad to Australia. We have a car. which is very hard to run. My husband is a manager of a football team. I am in the office nearly all day I start at halfpast ten have dinner halfpast twelve. While I am at work my mother in law comes round to look after the children. Our house is a private house. It has three bedrooms, a dinning room, scullery, sitting room and a very long hall. Both the children sleep together in the small room. I go to my sisters house every Friday night. I go to the library every week and get interesting books such as:- murdersm kidnaps (etc). I go to a Whist-drive on Thursdays, but nobody seems to want to be friends with me. We have a big garden with a rockery in it. We have a lot of flowers in it. Most of them are the common ones. We have a pond where the rockery is which has goldfish in it.  Words: 235
