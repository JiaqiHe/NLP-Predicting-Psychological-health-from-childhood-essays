I am now 25 years old. I have a small house just outside the town. I am a vet and I work all day. At home I have one dog and a cat. Every Saturday and Sunday after I have finished my work I take the dog for a walk. I take my camera to and take some pictures of birds. When my holidays come I get one week. I can take this one week whenever I like. During this one week I clean the house and mend anything that needs mending. I like doing things with animals that is why I wanted to be a vet. It is a very interesting job. I take my dog and cat with me because there is nobody else that could take care of them. At nights I knit jumpers to keep me busy. I like to knit but it just dread sewing. I took a house away from the town because it would be quiet. I don't like noisy streets and roads. One day I would like to go to Africa and see all the strange animals there. I have a dog and a cat but I would love to have a small monkey they are so clever. If I had one I would teach it how to drink out of a cup how to dance and lots of other things.  Words: 229
