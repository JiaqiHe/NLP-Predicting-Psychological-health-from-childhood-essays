When I am twenty five years old I would like to be a profasional footballer. i would like to have a small hotel round about (place). I would like the hotel to have about fifteen rooms. But only ten of the rooms in use I would also like the hotel to have a small petrol station, outside it. So some of the logers could buy petrol. I would charge them 5/9 for one gallon. I would go to the hotel on a Saturday night and come back on a Monday morning. I would buy a big house for my mother and father. I would not like to play in every football match. Because I would be getting to many injurys. When I am about twenty nine I might get married. When I am about thirty three I might stop playing football, and take up an other job.  Words: 147
