I left school three years ago and have had a job as a bank clerk since the day after I left school. I am renting a flat for six pound a week, which is not bad since I get 20xxxx a week and the flat is well furnished. I give my mother and father 2xxxx each when I go to see them that is every Sunday. I have got about 300 xxxx in the bank. My interests are football. and any other kind of sport. I go to a football match any day I can get a day off I usually go to see Fulham, Crystal Palace, and sometimes Chelsea. I like to go down to places like Somerset, Cornwall and Devon, where in the summer the heat down there is like the desert. I like to go to cinema in London and have meals in the posh hotels because it makes me feel important. And with the time I have left after doing all those other things. I watch the television. I go to see my sister in her flat every Wednesday night, she usually persuades me to give her * pound each week.  Words: 195
