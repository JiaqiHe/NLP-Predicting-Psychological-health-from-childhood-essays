My Name is [name]. I am in College. Soon I will be leaving to go to my job. I like it here all the other students are friendly. We each have our own room. In it is a bed, a chest of drawers a wash basin and a little gas stove. In the morning we start lessons at 10 'o clock At 1 'o clock we have lunch and at 2' o clock we start lessons again. The day finishes at 6 ' o clock. After if we haven't got any work to do in the night, we can go into town but we must be back by 10 ' o clock. On Saturdays and Sundays we can have visitors. My hobbies are stamp collecting and photography. I am leaving college next year and I hope I will have a very good job in the future.  Words: 146
