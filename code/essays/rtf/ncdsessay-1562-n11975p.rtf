Slowly the day drew on with an occasional customer popping into the shop, and now and again a lorry driver. The wireless gave the time five o'clock and I stood up, locked the shop, and cicylcled home. The children came to me asking for their tea. I began making the bread and butter when [male name] came up the drive he asked me if I was going to evening classes tonight. We had tea and I watched a bit of television I went to the evening classes and had a lecture of life in other countries. most of what I knew already.
I came back at about 9.3- and I went to bed for I was quite tired. Next morning I went to fetch D[male name]s breakfast before I went ridin on silver-moon for the day, while the children were at school. They stayed to school for dinner so I need not worry about them. I had a picnic lunch and I had some oats for silver-moon. The day was getting darker so I rode home and gave the horse a good rub down.
I walked inside and saw to the children, after this I done some washing and cleaning the house up. In the morning I went to work in the shop again like usual.
On Saturday I went shopping and I also took the children to the newly built amusment arcade.
We then went to a fish and chip shop to fetch our tea. I then took the children home where we met their gran who was going to baby sit for us, while we went to a dancing class.  Words: 268
