I am now 25 years old. I am a teacher and I like Music. I arrive at school nearly every morning at 8-45 a.m. and the children come in a 8-55. At 9 o'clock we have assembly every morning except Tuesday when we have Hymn Pratice. After assembly lessons begin and usually there is a lot of groans near the end of a term as they think because it is near the end of tern they need'nt do any work. On Wednesday my class has games but the rest of the week they have swimming. We have got a swimming Pool at our School. After school has finished I go drive home in my car. When I get home I mark the childrens work and write some more work for them to do the next day. After that I pratice some Music and then watch T.V. At 11'o'clock I go to bed ready for another morning. At weekends in the summer I go tenting and down to the seaside. In winter I visit relations and friends and sometimes I don't go out at all. I live in a flat on my own which sometimes can be very boring.  Words: 198
