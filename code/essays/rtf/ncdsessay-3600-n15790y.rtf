----------------------
I am now married. My husband is tall with dark hair and blue eyes. We are happy. We travel a lot and tour different countries like France, Sweden etc. and sometimes live there for about a year. I have 3 children, 2 boys and a girl. I work as a teacher and I like it. My other interests are making up plays and stories and drawing and painting. I especially like painting country scenes. I like studing nature, meanning* animals and flowers and I study the ones we see in the foreign countries that we go to. I have named my children Noline, (the girl) Alan and Gordon. I like to keep up with the latest frends in fashion and I like to make up my own fashions by drawing them. I like watching t.v. a lot and so does my husband and my children.
     Noline helps me with the work at home a lot. Gordon and Alan help their father. We hardly ever quarrel in our family and we both get on well with the others parents. I like flower arranging and we have lots of plants decorating the living and dining room. Our house is spacious, well light and quite big. It is detached and not to near a town. Near our house is a lake where my children swim and I study* water birds, animals and fish. We also live near a wood where my children play and I watch birds, insects, flowers, and study trees.
