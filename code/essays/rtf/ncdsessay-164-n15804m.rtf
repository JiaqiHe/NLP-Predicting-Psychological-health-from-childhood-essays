My job is an astronomer I've got my own observertory at [xxxxxxx], I've got two telescopes one is a refractor and one is a reflector, made made by myself. My house is a cottage on a hill without much trees around because it would stop me from obse-rving the stars. I,m engaged to a girl of 24. I like gardening very much, also I like sport like Badminton, tennis Football and cricket. I like going to race meetings (Greyhound and horse race meetings). I,ve got a dog which is a boxer to guard the house. I have a car, and I like going to the public bar to have a drink or two.  Words: 113
