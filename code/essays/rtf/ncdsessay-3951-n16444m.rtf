When Iam 25 years old .
when I am 25 years old I hope to be an a*tress , or a film star , or somehting. If I do not become anything like that I will probobly be a house-wife. When I was younger I used to think I would want to be a n***e or a school teacher , but I have now changed my mind , and would like to become an actress. My working will be every day , I will have an agent like my mother does, And my agent will phone me , and tell me if any body has chosen me for a part in a film . if they have my agant will give me the address and time of when or where I have to go . Prusumably it will be in (place), and if I can drive I will go by car or if I cannot drive I will go by train.
In my home or flat . I hope to have a dog or a cat I might have a child aswell, my husband will be at work also like me. Ihope to have many friends if I go into film buisness , and I hope to meet someone qiute familiar with the people of today . When my child grows up I will send her or him to ballet or to drama school if she or he likes to do it , or if she or he wants to be just plain and go to school and work all day I will not push them into ballet or drama. When my child is young , and cannot care for itself , I shall have a child sitter to take , her or him out each day and to look after the child . I shall have a modern appartment or home and my husband and I will decorate it prettily and welcoming . Ialso hope to keep in touch with some of the girls at this school, and I shall have parties in my free days or nights, My dog will certainly be a collie because they are my favourite dogs. My house , I hope will be in a nice quiet road by a woods , where there are friendly neighbours and children , In my spare time I will read ballet books about bording schools and I will remember the good old times when I came to (place) and what adventures Ihad .
