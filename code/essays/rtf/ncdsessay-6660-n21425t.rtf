The life I am leading is very pleasent. my job is a footballer I would like to play for west-ham. my intrests are playing the organ, another job that I like is being a motor mechanic. 
     I like to have hobbes like getting books from the libary every two weeks. I like watching television
I like sport very I like running, football, cricket and Badminton. I like reading books very much expescially to the Horror ones I would like to play for England one day. but I doubt if I will. I would like to have a Rover 2000 as my car.  Words: 102
