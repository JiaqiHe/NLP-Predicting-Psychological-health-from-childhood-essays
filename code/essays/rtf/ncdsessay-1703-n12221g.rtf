----------------------
I am married and a part-time secretary. I like housework. My interst are walking, swimming and reading. I like going to the cinema. I make my own dresses and enjoy dressmaking.
I don't know what I shall be wearing at the time.
I don't really know whether or not I will have any children. If I do have children I probably will not be working. I hope to be a good dressmaker so that I will be able to make things* for myself, my children, and maybe other people as well.
I would like to live in a nice house in the country or in a little village but not in the town because there is too much noise.  Words: 116
