At the age of twentey five. I would most likely be at art collage if I get a pass. If not I would like very much to look after foster children for about a year and a half then go on to be a hairdresser I do not think I will be married at that age. If I am I would go to live in Paris or NEW YORK. I would have two Afgahn Hounds and bread them. I would give them Pedegrie chum to eat. For my Holadaiy I woud go to Tiwan for about 3 months. I would foster children and bring them up very well, I would spoil them like any thing and give them what ever they want. 
They would have a private tutar.
I would live in a manor 12 cars. and would own a boutic. I would have half a dozen Pecasows paintings.  Words: 148
