----------------------
I am 25 years old, I have no children, I live in a beautiful house in Leeds. I do not have a lot of house-work to do, so I help other people who have plenty children and a lot of house work to do. I am very interesting in typing, so at night I go typing lessons. I have always had a mind to do Shorthand typing or nursing. When I have past my shorthand typing test I will print books and send them to different countries all over the world, but I will mostly write poems. I will help old people who need help, I will help them with their shopping, washing, Ironing, darning, srubbing the floor and kep their house nice and tidy, I shall do all I can to help them. Because they will be old and feeble and cannot help themselves, If I was old and feeble like them, I would like someone to help even to keep the house clean. After helping them and I have nothing to do I would go home and read some educational books to get more education. If when I have finished typing and I feel like do another Job, I would be a nurse looking after the sick in hospital and making them better, Iwould be very kind and gently. I will be as kind, and as gently as Florence Nightingale, she was famous and cared for people who needed caring for.  Words: 243
