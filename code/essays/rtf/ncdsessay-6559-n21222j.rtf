My name is [name] and I have just finished my studying from university and I am now ready for a job as an electricoin. I am on my way now for the job when I get there they will ask me for my name and addres and will tell me what I have to do first. Of course I will have to work as an aprentice for five years. They will give me a good wage of about 10 poudes of coa*sse it will start from xxxx5 pounds one year and 6 pounds the next and so on for five years each year going up a pound. After five years training course I will be able to go on to the real thing and get a wage from about 20 pounds and then when I really know the thing properly I will get 50 pounds or more. During the years I am working there they will send me to diffrent parts of the world and work there. They pay all travelling expences and I go by plane. But now I have not got the job yet I will just read books about electricity so that when I get the job I will know a lot about it. When I was young I always wanted to be an elictrision and my mother said if you want to be an electrisoin you must learn esespecally maths science and english.  Words: 237
