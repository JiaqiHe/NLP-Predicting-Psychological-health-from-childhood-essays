I am a proffesional footballer and I have 7 english caps. When I am not playing football I go fishing down the sea. I play for Chelsea and I am the centre-half. I also have got 20 goals. Once when I was substitute our goalie was taken to hospital with a broken arm and I had to go in goal. I let in 2 goals but our side won 3-2. Our best game was at Arsenal when we won 5-0. As I mentioned earlier on in the story my other hobbie is fishing. I like going out deep sea and conger fishing. My record conger is 70lbs.
At home I like reading. I have no wife but I amengaged. My favourite friend is [male name] [surname]  Chelsea right-back. My favourite friends in the England side is [male name] [surname]*, [male name] [surname] and [male name] [surname]. I live in guildford in the bungalow. I have a car, an alsaton dog and a dalmation. I like spending my time down the sea than spending my time at home. I think I would rather have a house than bungalow.  Words: 186
