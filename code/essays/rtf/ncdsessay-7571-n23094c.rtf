My life is a happy one, and my interests are, writing letters to my friends, keeping fit, going for a walk, picking flowers. I would like to work in a shop or be a hairdresser. I would watch the television every day in my spare time or read comics or papers. If I had a spare hour at night I would go to a bingo. In the mornings I would wake up at seven o'clock and go to bed at ten o'clock. If I did not feel fit enough I would exersize my legs each morning. If I found it boring sitting at home I would take a walk through the parks. Sometimes I might go to a musem to see everything. I would like to make Tapestry patterns.  Words: 129
