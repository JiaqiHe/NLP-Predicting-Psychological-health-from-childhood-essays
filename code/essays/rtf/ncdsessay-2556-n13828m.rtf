I work at two jobs one as a footballer, and another is garage attenate. In the football season I work at nothing but football I practice every morning at 10 o'clock. My other team mates are there as well, I play for Leeds United our goalkeeper in Garry Sprake, he is a Welsh international. My postion is the left wing. Our great rivals Liverpool have a good team to. When I was ten I used to support Leeds and hated chelsea, I used to call them the old Granny reserves. Chelsea have always had a good goalkeeper. One of them were transferred to Manchester United. his name Alex Stepeny. There goalkeeper now is Peter Bonitte.
We are playing Liverpool on Monday and drew 0-0 When we played them at home we beat the 1. 0. When Leeds won the League campionship they cheered them.  Words: 143
