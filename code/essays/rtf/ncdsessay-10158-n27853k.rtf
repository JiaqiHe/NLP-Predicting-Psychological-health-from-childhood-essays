I am 25 years old and I am a teacher at a primary school in our village. I teach 1st years and 2nd years. I am married to a teacher. I have one brother who is also married. He is a pliceman and sometimes has very important case to deal with. My father is a clerk and my mother a housewife. On saturday mornings in my spare time I teach children to play the violin. I often my violin at concerts. I enjoy knitting and sewing a lot now which I never used to when I was a child. My husband and I sometimes have holidays on the continent and enjoy them very much. If I have time on a weeknight I help my friend to organise her youth club which gets very noisy at times when the record player is on. In enjoy teaching children because that is always what I've wanted to do though I have had to work very hard to be a teacher. When I am not playing my violin at concerts I like going to watch them with my husband. At christmas all my family go to my pareents for a party. We have a great fun playing games and it si lovely to see al my relatives again.  Words: 214
