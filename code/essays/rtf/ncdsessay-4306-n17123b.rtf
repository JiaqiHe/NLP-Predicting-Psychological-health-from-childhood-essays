When I am 25 I hope to be a nurse and be marriaed to a man with black hair strong to looking and handsom (of corces). In my spare time I  might be a brown owl or do neddle work.
I know that being a nurse is hard work. But belongs they coarate I won't mind one bit. I suppose I like looking after  peope. What I have been looking foward to is pay day and getting what evere I like for luch. by the age of 25 I would like a baby girl. If is working gets to much for me I would give up work un till the girl is two, then I would send her to a nursery and get a part-time job in a shop.
I hope this dose happen. I am looking forward to the time when I am 25.  Words: 143
