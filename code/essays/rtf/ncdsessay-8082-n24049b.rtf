I am working as a macanick in a big garage. I have a car of my on and I like repainting it, and adding extra pieces to it.
At home I like adding shelves and other axeserys to the home as my hobby is woodwork. I like to see that all my tools are all right and buy better* tools so as the job is done right. I make a weekly visit to my mother and father to make shoore* they* are all right and their house is well looked after, that is hardly* necesery as my mother and father allways keep their house tide like my grandmother did.
