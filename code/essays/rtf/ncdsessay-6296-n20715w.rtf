Now I am 25 years of age I would like to have my own little house and study. When I finished studying I would like to pass and be an air hostess. If I got the Job I would be very happy and would get married and have children at the age of 30 I would like to have one boy and girl. I hope to have a nice comfortable house and not be poor nor rich because if I was poor it would mean that my children were poor as well as me and my husband. And I would not like to be rich because I would spend all my money at once and when I got to the age of about 70 I would be quite poor so I would like to have anough money to last so I can buy the food I need and put money in the bank then be able to buy clothes now and then and still have enough money to buy odds and ends so I would not be poor and not rich. I would also like my house to be clean and tidy and have it fully furnished from top to bottom. If I did not pass to be an air hostess I would carry on studying to be A short hand typist if I did not pass that i shall just have a small Job at home untill my children are five when they go to school I will have a Job in a factory and all myself a falure because I could not pass none of my exams at all and I still hope to be a good mother and a good wife and that is what i hope my future will be like with a very fine family I think it will turn out all right for all of us in the end.
