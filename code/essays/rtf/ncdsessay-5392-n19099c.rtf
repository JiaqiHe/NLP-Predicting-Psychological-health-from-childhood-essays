----------------------
I would have a family and be a carpentar. I would take my wife and children in the car to places. And I would go on holiday abroad and see sights. I would go to night class on carpentary and make things for the house, like selfes and cupbords. I would buy new aquiment and make a shed to put my gardening tools in and make the garden pretty with flowers. I would grow vegetalbals and decorate the house. And I would put some money in the bank every week. And I would take my family to the seaside. And invite my relatives to tea. I would have Rover 2000 as my car. To get the money for this I would save four pounds a week. I would buy a yatch and sail places like Australia and Canada and travel to Sidney and then to Quebec, and Ontairio, then Newfoundland and Manhatten. I would go camping with my family. And go Hikeing on on the hills in Scotland and teach my children how to use a compass. And I would buy a alopment to grow more vegetalbals like patatose, and cabbage, carrots, and spring oions, radishes, and lettace. I'd go to Cinemes and shows dances, and other shows with my wife. And I would often go to a fishing club.  Words: 220
