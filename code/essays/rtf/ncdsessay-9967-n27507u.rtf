----------------------
I am twenty-five years of age and an engineer. I have just been married. I usually get home from work at about 7.30. I set off for work at 6.45 in my Red Mini. I live up in Manchester and have a bungalow which I had built. Often, during the weekend, I go down and visit my Mother and father whom live in Middlesex. We are saving up to go for a holiday in Wales.
I am hoping to get promotion with better pay. I am a member of a tennis club which is held from January to October I go to the club once a week or sometimes once a fortnight. [female name], my wife, often says I don't go out enough but I don't agree. My boss is a very kind man and if ever my car brakes down he is always willing to give me a lift. I have to travel five miles to work and I go to the Star Cafe for lunch. My wife usually has a hot meal ready for me when I come home 
I am often delayed on the roads with the traffic and was once delayed at work until 10.30!
I sometimes go to a firm dinner and My wife and I often go out to dinner with friends. I lead a very pleasant life and I'm very happy.  Words: 226
