Well at the age of twenty five I would be trying to get into the manchester United Football team or try to get into the Jamacian Cricket team and become one of the profesinals or I might try to be an olimpia medeliast. I am very fond of fishing and other out door sports like high jumping or long jumping. I most likely will be looking for a Job as a bank clerk but I would realy want to get into the manchester United team and then they might put me into the ENGLISH team then I would be a fantastic Footballer and then when I got about 40 or 35 I would declair as a Footballer and become a Football manager or a trainer. then I try to move up and be the ENGLISH Manager and that is most liely what I will be doing when I am twenty five but that is a long time to come so at the moment I am training to me a profesional Football but who knows I might not even get into the Manchester uniteds side but I am going to take a try.
