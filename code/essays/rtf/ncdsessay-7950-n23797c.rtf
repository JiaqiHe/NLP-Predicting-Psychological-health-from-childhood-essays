When I am 25 I hope to be a nurse. I am a sister in the [hospital] in [city] I'm not married yet but I'm getting married in July. My boyfriend and I have a flat in [street] but shall get I house later in the year. As you might guess I have a very busy live at the hospital. So when I get home I make [name]'s (or [name]'s) dinner and then put my feet up for an hour or two. I then wash up and then I wash if it is Friday. By that time it is about 9 o'clock. My boyfriend is a plumer and works for [company]. My father likes this because he is a plumer also and work for [company]. I got to know [name] through my father, who brought him to our house when I was 20. Tomorrow night I will be on night Duty. So tomorrow I am only there for emergonces. I hope that there isn't any, because I want to see my Parents who live in [town]. I will go by bus and come back by train to get back by 3 o'clock so I can have a sleep in the afternoon. I hope to get the day of on my wedding day because if I don't I will have to go to Church in my uniform.  Words: 226
