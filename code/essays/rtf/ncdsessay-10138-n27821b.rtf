If I was 25 I think I would be married and have at least 1 child. I should not think I would be going out to work. My life would not be dull but interesting. I would be going shopping at least 3 times a week. I would still like reading books and funny comics. (beezer, Mandy, Beano, Buster + gigles ect.). I would do my dailey J'oBs in the house every-day. I would care for my child and give it its right food. I would not have shabby furnicher . If I was going out to work I would make sure that my child would be looked after by one of my friends.
