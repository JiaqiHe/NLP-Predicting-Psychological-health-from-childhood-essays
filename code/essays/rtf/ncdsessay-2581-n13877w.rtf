When I am 25 I hope to be living in Austrailia in the Navy*. I would like to have the Job of being a Radio Technichion on a Destroyer or cruiser. If neither of those* are available I would like to be an* Radar operator on and* Aircraft Carrier. This would tracking* down planes and Giuding them in to land on the Deck and take off. I want to go because to Australia because it is a nice modern clean country with* some of the best beaches in the world and plenty of Wildlife Reserves which I very much approve of. Also Austrailia has got marine parks where all kind of beautifull fish abound in their thousands. There are also the wonderfull but treacherous coral reeffs on which many lives have been taken. My interests will be in wildlife and Birds. Birdwaching is one of my hobbeis and I have seen some rare birds. All this is when I am twenty five so I have a long time* to wait, till* then.
