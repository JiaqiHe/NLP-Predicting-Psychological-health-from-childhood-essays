Having only just left College or University I wouldn't realy have started on a firm job, just writing for Magazines and helping around house. Perhaps my mornings would be spent writing, my afternoons cooking sewing washing or ironing and my evenings spent either watching telivision or out at dances or dinners ect. If my articles or poems got published the money would ceartainly be given to my parents or atleast most of it! Then, perhaps, oneday, if lack came my way and I gradualy got more things published I will try a story no longer articles. Later still I may get married and then leave my parents, to make my own home. It may be very hard at the beggining but I know that I will get used to it and enjoy it Then I hope that the grand day all will come when I get a book published and see my new name printed across it I say that day will be grand, well, when I have my first child it will be even better. I hope I will be a good mother and wife and will keep the house well for in this house I want there to be two happy children and a contented satisfied husband.  Words: 209
