My 25th birthday has just past. I have been married 1 year. I am a player with [football club] and I play at outside left. I get xxxx100 a week and I give xxxx50 to my mother and father. I own a sports shop in [town] that is where I live. I like cricket as well but soccer is my sport. I have played for 3 years with [football club], I played for Wales as a schoolboy on three occasions. I hope to get a Welsh cap soon. I get a lot of customers at my sports shop and I get a lot of money out of that so I cannot say I am poor. If I have a son I hope he will be a soccer player like me. I have traveled all over the world with [football club]. I've been to Africa and America on freindly tours and I've been all over Europe in the European Cup Winners Cup competision. Our home is quite a large one and has large lawns. I have built a swimming pool on one lawn and it is 8ft deep. I have a M.G.B and it go's very fast. I have a horse and so has my wife.
