I am now 25 years old and I am in the Royal Navy. I have been in the Royal Navy since I was 18 years old. I have got about five years to in the Royal Navy. In the Royal Navy I am a Gunner and I am enjoying it very much in the Royal Navy. I have a lot of hobbies, including swimming and divving. In the Royal Navy I take part in lots of sports, such as motor cycling, road racing, which is on special Bicyles. So far I have been to Australia, Malta, Japan, Hong Qong, Burma, Denmark, Canada and America. My ship is called H.M.S. RIGLEIGH. My job is to fire shells loaded with explosives into the sea to blow up the enemy submarine. Me a my friends often go ashore when the Ship comes into a cove or bay for swimming. When I was a boy I had a small boat called Nina, it was brown with white inside. We had a seagull outboard engine to put on the back, but when the tide is out we skull it.  Words: 184
