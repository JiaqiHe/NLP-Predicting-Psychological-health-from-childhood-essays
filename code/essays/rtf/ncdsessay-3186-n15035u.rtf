When I left college I went to the (place) and had an interesting career there. I have now left and am working at the (company) at (place) . My uncle is still head of the department so I am working under him. I am not married and don't think I want to. It is much easier not to be, well, I think so!At home I like writing short story's about my life, almost an autobiography. When I think of my younger days I can only remember certain facts, sailing for one. The day we capsized our Dayboat in (place) is still clear in my mind. that was a long time ago when I was fourteen I also remember the day we moved house when I was eleven we moved in the Summer of 1969 when I was eleven. I was allowed a small pet or a tent I am afraid I chose a tent. (name) my best friend used to come over for a week every summer. I slept out in the t**t with him but when my fourteenth birthday was coming up I chose a dog, a golden labrador. she died last week when she was eleven. I'm having a Beagle, a batch next week. My twenty-sixth birthday is tomorrow.  Words: 211
