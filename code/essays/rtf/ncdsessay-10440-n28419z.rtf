I am not doing to badly actually. There is a Health Stores which I own money is coming in but not quite as much as i expected. Just recentally I had luck with one of my bonds, well it doezn`t mater realy as long as I have some fun. Hobbies, well I go down to the snoker club. I collect coins which are very interesting I've got about 500 600 dating back to 1500. (name) my niebough spends alots of time helping me make toys for the children who are in hospital. I live in a small bunglow which is just fine. Later on I ho*e to move abroad when I have enough money saved up I would rather like to go to switzerland. Where I ho*e to have another shop but bigger.
