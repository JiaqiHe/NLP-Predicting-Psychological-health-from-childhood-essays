I lead a good life I have a good job as a pilot in a douglas skyhawk and a Ryan X 15. I am not married as I have not enough money to do so. I have a big house with 7 bedrooms in and a large kitchenwith a cook to make my meals. I used to live with my mother and father until I got my own house, also in my house I have a big living room and a reasonable sized dinning toom. In my spare time I play football and other energetic sports. I wish to join the army but Iam still in the Air Force. I wish to become a flight squadron leader because I think it a good position to be in. I have a boat of my own and it is called royal marine it has an inboard motor and it is coloured blue and red, it also has a big name plate on the front of it. I also have a car it is a sports car. It has a nice garge to go with it too. I like my job and my suroundings.  Words: 191
