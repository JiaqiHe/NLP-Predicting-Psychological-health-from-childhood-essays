"I live in a little house on the sheaven hill. Which is covered with leaves and heather it took quite some time to clear. Although I did it finally, it still was covered with leaves a little heather and bracken. At one o,clock I went to collage when I came back, my mother came out to meet me. I've bought you a new jaguer. My girl ran out of house shouting ""Dada got a big car."" My work was a draughts man. Drawing up plans. My wifes name was [female name] untill she went to live in America. We still was quite rich we invested most of the monet I got into the bank. The bank manager was kind to me he helped me with my plane which I was building which I hoped to fly in another year. All the things I would need would cost money."  Words: 148
