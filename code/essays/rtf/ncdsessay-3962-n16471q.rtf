I am a docter of science in the I c I chemechal division, my work is very difficult I have to test various things. Take the other day for instance, we received a consignment of white paint, We tested it and found out all the different chemicals it contained we then tested each chemical seperately, till we found one which was making the paint a little bit greyer. Then we replaced it with another chemical which would make it brighten and so our work goes on. My home life is a very happy one I am married with two children. I live in a bungalow on an estate in the country. I have two dogs as pets, as well as a pond in the back garden with then goldfish in.  Words: 130
