I would try to get some work as a teacher. Just taking infant classes, when I got home at night I would knite cloathes for my children and knite things for my husband too . On a Satuarday I go out to a club that has dancing. I would get a dog for the children. Every Sunday when both of the children were five they would go to church with me . The children always went out to see their grandmother after church as she lives herself . When I work in the school I take the children down to (place) or park to play games in the sun , for about one hour then they would come back to the class-room to do some sums. As there is very often fighting I would do my best to stop it . Older children over nine years of age are always fighting. The children that were disabedient I would belt like all other teacher . After a while , I got board of teaching . I stopped working and just stayed at home .
I bought a new car and one Satiurday . after we had been shopping. We went to the sea-side, it was lovely and the sun shone . My husband was not thire he warks in the army . So we just had to forget him , we stayed at the sea-side for three hours then we had a little picnic with some sanguages and jelly, biscuits, and cakes.  Words: 250
