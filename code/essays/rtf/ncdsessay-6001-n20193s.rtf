I am now a professional footballer I have just joined Everton F.C. I am earning a good wage of fifty pounds a week. My position on the team is inside left. I play alongside Joe Royle, Alan Ball, John Hurst and myself, I have been capt for England only eight times but I am still very proud of the fact. I am also interested in locomotives and have got hundreds of numbers. Every Saturday I play for Everton when I am at Goodison Park I am the great [name] who plays for Everton when I am at home I am treated normally and have not got fifty thousand fans screaming at me. I find it nice to get away from it all now and again by going out in the country with my family. Some of my time is spent gambling mostly at night when I go out with my wife. Some of my money usually goes to charities* and some to my mother and father, I have a boutique and find my customers all very friendly  Words: 177
