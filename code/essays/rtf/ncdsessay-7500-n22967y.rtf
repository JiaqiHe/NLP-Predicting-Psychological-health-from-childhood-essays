I am a hairdresser, my age is 25. I work five days a week from Monday to Friday and have the Saturday off. In my spare time I like to make dolls,(KNITTED) and to sew Tray cloths. If I am bored with knitting and sew-ing I do some cookery. I like to read mystery stories. I'l get back to hairdressing. I work very hard and try to do my best to please the customers. This is the day Thursday I have done one shampoo and set and two perms, in between I wash and rinse the hair. When any body phones up about making an apointment I get a huge book out and tell her what day would be suitable. I have been a hair dresser for three years . and was learning to be a hairdresser for two years In about twelve weeks time we will be getting our summer holidays. I am hoping to go to (place) for three weeks. We get five weeks holiday from (name). our Manager. On Monday's and Tuesdays we are not awful busy . It is on Thursdays and Friday morning when the hard work begins . On a Wednesday it is just in between. There are eight girls that work each day .  Words: 211
