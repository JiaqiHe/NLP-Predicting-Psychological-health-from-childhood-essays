My name is [name] and I have brown hair and hazel eyes. I* am 25 years of age and I like swimming and would like to be and swimming conductor. I have just got married and my husbands name is [name], and he is 26 years old. A few months later I was due to have a baby on the 20th June. At last it came but they were twins and I was very happy. I decided to call them [name] and [name]. When I was in the nursing home I had lots of presents.
      Soon I had my children christsened. While I had been in the nursing home my husband had been decorating our house and it was nearly finished. My husband was an engineer and he was very buisy. At first I found it very difficult copping at home, but I soon got used to it.
      Quite often I went back for a check up and, once they said I was going to have another baby, but it was there calculations which* were wrong, and I was very glad because even two were enough. My husband was not at home very much because he was very busy. Soon he changed his job and it became easier for me.  Words: 210
