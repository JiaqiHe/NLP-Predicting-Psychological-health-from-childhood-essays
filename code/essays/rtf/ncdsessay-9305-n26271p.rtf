I am a vet, I have got a suguery where I operate and look after different kinds of animals. I live in a small detached house in a very quiet little village. I am not married, I work with three other vet's, we all have our surguerys we go there every morning sometimes we have a lot of animals and the waiting room is full of barking dogs, and other animal's. other days there are very few people and it is very quiet and lonely. Some people come every  week if there animals have broken their legs or some other part. It is interesting but hard work it is harder to be a vet than a doctor a vet deals with different animals. But a doctor is always dealing with the same things I left college a few years ago. My house has three bedroom's, one bathroom, a toilet, a dining room, a living room and a kitchen. Sometimes I am quite late home at night when I have an operation to do. I have half day closing on tuesday. I get very well paid for the Job I do.  Words: 190
