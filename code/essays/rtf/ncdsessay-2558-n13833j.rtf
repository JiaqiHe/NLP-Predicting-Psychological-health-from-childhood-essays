I am 25 years old my job is an air hostes, most of the time I am traveling but occasonaly I go home to visit my parents. When I go home I help my mother very much. I like traveling to different countrys and meeting different people. I am interested in languages, I speak French Spanish Italian and German. When I am on holiday for three weeks I isialy get a job for a week and then I stay at home and help my mother. I work on B.O.A.C. planes, and meet other air hostes'es. I have to wash up and serve meals and talk through a loud speaker. But its all worth it to go to other countries. I like going to America because nearly every thing is so cheap there. In France every thing is very dere. But there are lots of beautiful sites to see.  Words: 148
