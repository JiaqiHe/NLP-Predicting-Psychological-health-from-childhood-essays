If I was 25 I would be married and would like to have a good job. I would go out a lot and enjoy myself. I think I would like to be a football player and I would not have many hobbies. I would lead a happy life doing as it want eating and I want and is I had a lot of money going on a lot of holiday all over the world. I would not be a very quite man and I would be active all the time and I would hope to be a strong and tall man. I would have many friends and go the clubs with them. The few hobbies that I would have would be swimming collecting coins or stamps and trying to be a good an atherlite as I could.
If I could not be a footballer for a job I would try to be a buisnes man in some big store. It was very clever and went too a collage I would get a very good job somewhere much better than a footballer.  Words: 180
