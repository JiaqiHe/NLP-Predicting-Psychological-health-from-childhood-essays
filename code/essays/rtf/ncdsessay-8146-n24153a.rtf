"Yeterday I was twenty five years old, my job is a nurse. When I was training to be a nurse, I was away from home for a very long time. I don't or didn't visit my parents very much. But when I do, I often stay for a week or two. I live with a friend called [female name] [surname] in a flat in Leeds [female name] is a teacher, she teaches in a cenior school called ""The Intake"" it is a school for boys and girls. I have many hobbies beside nursijng. My car is a Ford Cupree. Its colour is yellow. I do not work on a Sunday evening, so I often go to clubs, or dances. When it is my turn on night duty, I often ask Sister [surname] to help me becouse I am a newcomer, I go and straighten peoples or should I say patients beds and give them magasins and books to read. I have always said that I wanted to be a nurse ever since I was only three years old. My mother and father said that nursing is a very good job and besides you get a good wage. Three of of my aunts were nurses,but they are not any more. I like my job and I think I always will. I am very glad I chose my job if I ever have children I hope they are too."  Words: 237
