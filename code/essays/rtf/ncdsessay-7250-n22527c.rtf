I am an air hostess and I travell to different countries. I love to collect stamps and read. At home I just rent a flat in London near the airport with two of my friends. I have had to learn different launguages and can speak Italian best. I love animals and have a cat a Canary and dog. We rise at 6 o'clock and work all day. I sometimes work at night. My friends and I cook each others meals. Sometimes I cook or sometimes I do the housework or go shopping. I like best to go to Spain on the airoplane. Some times if the plane does not need to be used untill a few hours later I am alowed to roam a round the town. on some planes I get rather difficult passengers* Mostly there are alway a few people who are sick. I always take my camera, as there are plenty of things to see. I like to go swimming but theres not very much chance of that as I only have one day off a week except Sundays. I alway buy stamps there as I collect them and have already filled 3 books with the help of my freind. I get good wages and make sure that I always have some handy. I go to the cinama in London and enjoy going ballroom dancing. I have a boy freind but would not give up being an air hostess for anything.  Words: 244
