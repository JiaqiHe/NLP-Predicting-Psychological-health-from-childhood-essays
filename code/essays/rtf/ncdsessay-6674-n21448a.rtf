When I was sixteen I went to get A job as a nurse, first I hadto fill in some forms and the next day I started. It was a filthy job at first but I soon got use to it when, I was 20 I got mooved to wat I called A propper nurse and I got A little badge witch had the inishals on S.R.N which stands for State registered nurse I like this because when enrybody had to have an apparation I took part when I was 25 I was fedup of nursing so I left and got married and had twin children which gave me as much trubble as when I was a nurse but I looked after them.
