When I twenty-five I hope to marry a rich man and I hope he will be kind love horses. I very much want to breed horses. I like to have about ten, five New Forest ponies and five rave horses but I'm not really sure of race horses because they break their necks easily its rather a wast of money and I can't bear thinking of horses who have died in that way. I would like lots of Pinto ponys as well they are usually piebald. I would them to jump and go to gymkhanas and to show jumping. I would love to go on hunts but I feel sorry for the poor foxes. I have rode otehr peoples horses many a time and I love it. I read horses books quiet alot. I know quite a lot a things about horses but not anough to bread them. I think horse a very pretty and are very nice to ride. I will have a groom to muck out the horses and things like that. I don't want to be an old snob but if you're not rich you can't have hardly anything you want. I like them to be 13 to 14 h.h. I think I might own a riding school as well and have it quite cheap like five shilling an hour. When the pupils are a bit older I would let them go to the gymkhanas and things. I would like my home next door to the riding school in the outskirts of a smallish town. My husband and I would help look after the horses as well. And I like to invite poor children who can't aford riding lessons to ride the horses for nothing.  Words: 288
