----------------------
I would be a racing driver. with a Lotus 49 F/1. Also I would not be a family man for a few years more. I would be a mechanic in my spare time. working at [garage]. where I would fit tyres and fix cars. My interests would be Racing Cars. and Mechanics on cars. I would be a strong man, and have guite a lot of money. xxxx300,000 or so, which I would spend on a house. a small one if possi*ble. in Spain, Torremolinos. and with the rest of the money. I would put it in the bank. 
My life would be set on racing, and every month I would travel to Monaco, to compete with other drivers, and make more money. I would give a lot of money to charity, and more to my parents.
      My point in being a mechanic is if I crash in a race I will be able to fix the car. 
      I would design other racing cars, and sell them for large sums of money, so when I was 40 years old, or so, I could retire from racing, unless I get killed in a crash, and then all my money would be sent to my parents.
I would enjoy easy living, and be lazy at times when I'm out of work.
My racing car would be painted pink, and would have a purple stripe down the front, and round the nose. My clothes would all be pink, white, or blue, and I would have a speed-boat with a small cabin on top.  Words: 259
