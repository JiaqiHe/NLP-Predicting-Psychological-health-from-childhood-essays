When I got home cooked my self some ham and eggs I sat wondering about life, after I washed up I got changed and went to the hospital to see my child I wonder wether its a girl or boy. When I got there I went stright to the sister on duty I asked to see me wife. ""[female name]"" I said ""His it a boy or girl boy"" she said ""I'am happy are you"" I said ""you bet"".
