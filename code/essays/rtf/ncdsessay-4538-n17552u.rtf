My job is doing hard sum's that nobody else has been able to do. I have been to University and have been intrested in queit a lot of things I was going to be a lawyer and then a scientist but then I changed my mind and became a Mathematishen. I have got a plesant life with a wife and two children. My car comes from an inventor called [male name] [surname]. My two children are aged at five and six. They go to a school down the road and are hoping to become like me. My father was an engineer and my mother was a plian housewife. At home I sit down and rest or do some gardening. At the bottom of the garden there is a wood were my children go and climb. I fichsed a swing up in the wood. The house is in a small town called [place name] and in [place name] there is a little chapel where we go every Sunday. I play golf and tennis. I still collect stamps and postcards as a hobby. We are sheltered from the wind when it blows from the North because of the wood. I still read the comics which my children have got, but I also read newspapers and magazines. I like make models and things out of wood. I make shelfs for the house and orniments. I also like driving in the country lanes and climbing hills where the wind blows hard. Ive been in hospital, where I broke my leg. The thing I like most is coming home and putting my feet up on a stool and go to sleep.  Words: 276
