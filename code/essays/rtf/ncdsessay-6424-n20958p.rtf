At the age of 25 I would look for a home somewhere in the Country. Buy a car and then have a few pets* for intance a dog a parrot play for a amaturm football Club and have a job as a bank Clerk. If I got maride and had a child I would try to bring it up as well manered as possible so people would think that I've got a well mannered child I've got and if I were leading a welthy live had a good wage and when my child came home I would give her half an hours work. And try to make friends with a many people as possible* go out* every night. and go to church every Sunday.  Words: 124
