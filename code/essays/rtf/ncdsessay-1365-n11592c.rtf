As I am now 25, I may have children. And through the last few years I have been getting to know more and more things about life. As I have been getting older, I have been getting weary at sports. Also I have been doing many things to do with houswork for my mother. I now am working as a secratary, and I like my Job very much. My intereses are looking after children, & taking walks into the country. I am now married, & have children of my own. The names of my children are [name], [name], [name], [name]. My husband is an engineer & also likes his Job. I work very hard every day to cook meals, for the children coming from school. Soon I thought, I will have my very own children married, & be only me and my husband. After all I have been the University. Each year I have probably been cooking 3000 meals for my husband & children. My husband, as he is now working he has worked for xxxx10 a week wages. I now think I will live happily on.  Words: 187
