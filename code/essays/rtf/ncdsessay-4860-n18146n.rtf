I am [name]. I work at a stables in [area], my actual job there is taking trekking or Hacks out, sometimes I clean out the stables, when it's raining. At home I am writing a book, and I hope to get it published and write some more. I am also going into a lot of horse shows. Which I have not done too badly in. I am looking for a riding stables, that I could either buy or lease. If I had enough money I would always know what to do with it, (not like some people) I would buy a big house and have about ten servants and some maids (enough to clean the house). I would also (if I was really rich) try to buy most of the Dartmoor, Exmoor and New Forest ponies, because I think they are very thin. Next year if the ship can find room for me, I am going to Iceland, Spain, France and Portugal. If I could buy a big house, I think I would buy it in Australia as the country has many acres, and if they would come I would take my mother and father with me. I am also a great reader I always have been and I think I alway will be.  Words: 214
