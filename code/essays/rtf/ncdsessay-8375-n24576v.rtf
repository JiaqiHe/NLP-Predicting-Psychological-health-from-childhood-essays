I am now in Barcelona in Spain. From here I will go to Italy and from Italy to Paris. I will come from Paris to England. Then I shall find a job in England and collect all the money I can get, and finally go all over the world. After I have been over the world I will get married and live in the country I thought best and learn their coustoms and ways, I will have children and if I have a girl I will call her [name} and if a boy I will call him [name]. In the day times I will work and I will look after my children. Then at night I will study different languages as I am very interested in different languages. I will ask my children to go over the world so they will be able to see how nice the world could be. And then I will tell them to live in country they thought best. I will tell them why I have asked them to do this because I did and I would like them to do the same and if they would like to, study languages and take intrest in them. Then I will train to be an Air Hostes because I will no a lot of languages. and I will no most of the countries people would like to go to. I will enjoy my life when I am able to do all this.
