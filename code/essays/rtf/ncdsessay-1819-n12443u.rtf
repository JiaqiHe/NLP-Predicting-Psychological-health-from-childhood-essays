If I was 25 I think I would still be at art college designing dresses. I would live in a modern flat in [town] and I would have all modern furniture in every room. In my spare time I would paint pictures and clean my flat. Sometimes I would visit my Mum and Dad. I would make new curtains for my flat. Nearly every weekend I would go to [town] and in the holidays I would go to London and look round Boutiques all day and now and again I would go to museums.
Sometimes I would go to Night School and learn languages like Spanish and Italian. I would like to spend some of my time travelling to different countries and meeting new people. Before I go to sleep I would read a magazine. I would not get married till I was 32.
That is the type of life I'd like to lead when I am 25.
I would not smoke because I can't stick the habit. After going to college all day I would go out to Night clubs in the evenings or may be go out with a boy-friend, some evenings I would stay in and study for colelge next day. On week nights I would'nt go to bed later than half past ten.
