When I'am twenty five I want to be a petrol pump man in a Garage and in spare time be a footballer. And home life I would be fixing thing's that are broken. And my intrest I would make model planes and model bouts. And about leading my life I would do nice thing's. And I am not going to get married and sometime's I would get bored at home. And in a garage I would fiil car up with petrol and spray car's And home life I would make seat for the garden, and dig the garden and plant flowers. And the rest of my spare time I would do on a car or a garage and scramble on motor bycle and that what I would do when I am twenty five. And I would help other people on there cars.  Words: 142
