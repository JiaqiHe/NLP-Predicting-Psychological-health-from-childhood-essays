If I were 25 I would like to be a policeman I would hafe to get up about 8 o'clock in the morning. I'd get to work about 8.30 in the morning and I would be on patrol all day. Somtimes I would direct the traffic sometimes, walking round on my beat another day, and patroling in a panda car another day. And every time I saw somthing suspisous I would look into it and if it was anything to do with a crime I would take whoever it was back to the police station and ask the detective sergent or the detective inspecter to see whoever it was. And then go back on my beat and knock-off about 5.30 at night and do more or less the same next day. On my days of I ride round the country side in the car with my wife if I had one. And we would go on picnics if the weather was fine. But if it was raining I would stay in and do some work around the house and do jig saws on the table.  Words: 185
