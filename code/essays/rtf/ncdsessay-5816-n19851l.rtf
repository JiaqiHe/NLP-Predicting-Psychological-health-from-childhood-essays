I get up in the morrnig and get my break fast and get my typerwriter out and fix it all up ready for when I begin in the afternoon. My job is writing scripts for a television serial. I get quiet a good wage. I have many interests one is reading long old novels so I might get some ideas for my scripts. Another is doing sketchs of thing or people sometimes I once thought I might become a full time artist but I became more interested in play writing and took that up instead. Now I shall copy one of my plays out to send to the manAger And thats one of my working days copying scripts out  Words: 119
