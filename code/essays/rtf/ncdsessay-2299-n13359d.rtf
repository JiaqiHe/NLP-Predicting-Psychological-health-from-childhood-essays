When I am Twenty Five
      When I am 25 years old, I woudl ike to marry at the age of 20 and get a good job and have a large house with four Bedrooms. Five years later when I am 25 I most probaly have two children. I could try to get a job as a Air Liner pilot. For my holidays I would like to go abroad to other countries such as spain where it is mostly hot all the time I could even stay at one country for two years. I would most probaly choose Australia because it is known two be the best country for families. I would buy a car bigger than the one I would of I allready have.
      When I buy my house I would like it to have four bedrooms, a dinning room a kitchin a decent size lounge with good furniture. I would like a stair case leading from the hall. I would have central heating, a telephone, a televesion, a radio, record player, oven and a fridge with a three star freezer. It may cost a lot of money but I would take it out of my life savings and job money. I would try to keep the gas electricity and gas bills down.
      When I go on holiday which will have to be a few years later to a hot country a-brrad. If I had not enough money I would go to the Isle of White or Man. I would stay there for a couple of weeks.  Words: 257
