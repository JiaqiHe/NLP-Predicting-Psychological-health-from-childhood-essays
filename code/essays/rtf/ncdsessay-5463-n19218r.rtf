When I am 25 I want to be a Shopkeeper I want to own a Shop I will open at nine close for a lunch hour at 1/2 past 12 open* again at 1/2 past one I will close at 7 o clock I will have thursday half day closing. I am interested in football (a helper looks after the Shop when I go out) Sewing and animals. I would have a dog I think I would call it Ricky, I would have a bird and a cat I would call it cindy. I would be married in the home I would do the house work bake and do some other things. My husband could look after the Shop when I am doing the house work when I had finished I would tidy myself up and go into the Shop. Just after 5 past 12 I would go into the house the house would be at the back of the Shop with a door leading in to it. I would make the dinner when I had made it I would dish it up because my husband would have finished in the Shop. When we have had it I would clear away and wash up I would sit down and read a book at half past one I would go in the shop. On half days I would stay in and do some*-thing if it was cold, wet, or dull dut if it was hot, sunny day I would go out we woud have a car so we could go out we would sell food, sweets, cigarets, and frozen things. Sometimes on Saturday I would go to town or go to the football. When it was dull or wet I would sit by the fire and read a book or do something else.  Words: 302
