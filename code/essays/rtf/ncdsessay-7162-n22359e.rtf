My Life is very intresting, I am in the WRAF at [airstation] RAF station. I am married with no children though I am praying for a girl. My hasband is kind and generouse to me. I am a hopless cook though my friends say I am good.

At home we usualy sit an talk, listen to the radio or watch the telivision. at weekends we go out to Glostershire. On an RAF station you have a ***ss, it is a place* were we go for Balls or lunches and* things of the kind. Well tonight I am going to a W.R.A.F Dinner party with my husband. I completley forgot to tell you but I have been posted to Malaye on the 19th of January which is in two weeks time. In the RAF we move around a lot and see many parts of the world.  Words: 163
