Now I'm Twenty Five.
My name is [name]. I am married to an italian man called [name], and I have one son called [name]. When I was Seven, I went to a grammer school in Wales. After my grammer school life, I went on to a trianing college to improve my knowledge on laungages. After that I got a Job in a school teaching French and German. One year while on a holiday in Italy. I met my husband. I got a Job whilst I was there and liked it so much that I stayed there and got married. Now in my summer months I am a courier with my husband who drives the coach. Our regular trip is from Lido De Jeslr to St. Marks square. But before our trip we go around the camping sites picking people up. But in the winter my husband and I teach English in an Italian School. [name] my son is nearly two now so he does not go to school yet. [name] stays with a nurse in the day who looks after him very well. Every day I am up very early, so on some days, I do not see [name]. On our tour we see lots of historical buildings. My husband and I, meet our friends every night, and go out to see the town. For our holidays this year we are going to take [name] to England, because he has never been there before. [name] can talk very well for his age. In a few years I hope to have more. As I love them very much.  Words: 266
