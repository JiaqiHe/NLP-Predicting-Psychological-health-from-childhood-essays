The day began at a quarter to eight, and ended at half past ten. I awoke, putting on my dressing gown and went into the kitchen to make some tea. I then dressed, and then ate my breakfast.
I left my house and went to work. I was now working as a typist and secretary in a large white-washed building.
I came home for lunch, and my afternoon was spent doing household chores.
In the evening I relaxed and usually fell asleep for half an hour. 
On this day which I did no office work, I enjoyed a gallop over the moors, on my horse whose name was Silver.
On a Sunday I would go to morning Church, and in the afternoon would be hostess to a few friends.  Words: 125
