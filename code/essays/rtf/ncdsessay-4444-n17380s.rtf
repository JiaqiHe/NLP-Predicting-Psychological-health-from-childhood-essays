If I was twenty five years of age I should most propeble be at a collage of some sort and would be training to be a window dresser or something like that.
When a holiday came I should like to go with a group of friends to Swisterland and then go sking up on the snow peaked mountains. When it was time to go home to England I would go and buy little sueverneairs for the rest of my family and my friends. 
When I got home I should propeble sleep like a log and then for the rest of the week go to the ceinmaror even to some conserts with a few of my friends. But soon it would be back to the grind stone for another coupel of terms work.
I would love to be twenty five years of age if I could practicly do whate I liked when I liked. But I sopose there would be some* little song in it some where don't you?  Words: 166
