I am an Air Hostess, but when I'm at home I am a cook. I am interested in animals and in my spare time I like going to animal homes. Occ*asionly I study French and German. I started about three months ago and I have many friends. I am now hoping to fly in the Concord. My mother says its a dangerous job but it isn't really. Reciuntly theres been an air strike but its all over now. The (company) is my company.  Words: 83
