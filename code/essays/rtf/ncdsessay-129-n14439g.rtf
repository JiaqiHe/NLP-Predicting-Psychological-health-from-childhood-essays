I am now 25 years old and I am interested in farming and I would like to settle down and have a farm and a wife and have enough money and have machinery. I could be a very good farmer and havegood [have good] soil on my land. I perhaps might have a workman and we might improve the farm and have more money and could buy more land and have a combine to cut the barley but this all comes in time and perhaps it will come and I will be very wealthy.
