One day I was making the tea when my 2 children came home They said what have we got for tea I said wait and see. John and Karen did their homework and then had their tea. Just as they were having their tea in came my husband. After my husband had had his tea I turned on the telivition we watched telivition for a while then we called the children in, they washed had supper and went to bed. Soon we went to bed. But before we went to bed my husband cleaned the shoes In the morning I woke the same time as my husband I got up and washed and dressed. I went down stairs to have breakfast. I said good-bye to my husband and called the childen to get out of bed they came down and had breakfast. They went to get their school bags and set of to school. After that I put on my coat and went to the bus stop to go to work I ran down to the bus stop just in time to catch the bus.  Words: 185
