I am now twenty five years old, I am Guider and every Wedensday night I go to Guides and I teach all the Guides different activites. This year the Guides from Selly are having a Guide Rally. I have a park time job in a shop, I go behind the counter and sell the variours things to different people, I am at the Cosmetics stall and I sell make-up mostly to young women. At home I have a bedroom of my own and I like to pin pictures on the wall and I like to see every thing put away tidyly. I like house work and I like cooking best of all and my favorite meal is fish and chips. I have no particular hobby but I like going Swimming. I have not moved from [town] and I don't thing that I ever want to. In my spare time I go bicycle riding and when I go I pick wild flowers, and blackberries. For my holidays this year I am going to Austria and Yugoslavia when I was at school I always loved Geography and now this very year for the first time in my life I have the chance to actually go and see it for myself. I am flying by plane from London Airport. in July  Words: 218
