I work for **** on ****. I am an electrician and at the moment I am working on the lighting for **** new factory in ****. **** **** and I travel to the site by one of the works six mini vans. Already the lights are wired up and are only waiting for the main wires to be fixed to the man* electric wire. I am still interested in fishing, and just recently I went on a holiday up to scotland fishing for ***ke, Perch and salmon. Quite by accident **en I was spinning for Perch in Loch Ness I landed a huge 56lb Pike which was 4lbs clear of the existing record, caught in the British Iles. I felt such a huge tug that I thought I had hooked the Loch Ness monster. On sundays, which is my holiday from work, I usually go fishing on **** canal. My work is hard but I enjoy it. Still in all my career at **** I have not electructed my self yet. I get a very good wage, and this summer I am planning to go on safari to East Africa with my new camera . But before I go I am saving up to get a zoom lens and plenty of colour film, Formy cine camera. I plan to stay for 2 weeks in ****. I have a vaque Idea of the cost which I think will be around 275 pounds. Already my saving are creeping nearer and nearer that sum.  Words: 251
