"To day I am 25 and am not married my job is an electrion and on the first day of March when a person came in to my shop and said ""help!"" my tele has gone up in smoke."" so I came down to my car and drove off down to the persons house to take a look at the television. Two valves had broken and shorted the circut. so I turned off the electricity and took it down to my shop where I took out the old valves and checked them. I a few minuits I had new valves in and the person gave me the money and I gave her her television. On the 2nd I had to mend an old radiogram which had been bought in a Jumble sale two needles had broken and the loudspeaker had been riped so out the broken bits and put in a new loudspeeker and two new needles which took me all day to do it except for a cup of tea and and some chips from the machien out side. On the 3rd a firm intercome had broken, so I took my mate geff when we found the troble some one had put a high ampage fuse in and it had blown a lardge amount transistor so we took them out put new ones in. On the 4th its my birthday and I didn't have much to do only two UII batterys and a mercury cell. The 5th was day when close early because it was wednesday and it was half day closeing. And so you see how my life goes on from day to day."  Words: 276
