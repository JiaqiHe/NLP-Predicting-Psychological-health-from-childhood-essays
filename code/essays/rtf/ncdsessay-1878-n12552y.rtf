I would be married and have two children one boy and one girl. My jod as nurse in the childrens ward. and take my children to the cinema at night when I would come home from my jod. We would take the children a week's holiday in the summer to Blackpool or Butlins* I would like to go on working till I am 36 years old and then be a house wife. In the house the childern have a room to themselves. When they would get older I would allow the to go to the cinema there selves I would give them 10/- shilling each to spend and the would go to bed on school day at half past nine. and at the week and half past ten or ten o'clock. My husband would have a car and we would go runs every Sauturdays and Sundays. Maybe to their grans and grandads or to the fair or the boy go to the football match and the girl go the bath's she would get 5/- to spend and the boy would get 5/-.
