At that age, I would most likely have finished my studies at university and be working. 
I see myself now as a paleontologist. It's a good hob. I get to travel often to dig out fossils which turn up in the most unusual places. 
I will live someplace near the sea but in England. The house will be of a modern style, a kind of bungalow on stilts with stairs leading up and a very small ground floor leading dow to a an underground sitting room but since it will be on a hill, the further end will be above ground and will give sufficient light.
As for hobbies, I will build radio-controlled planes and boats and own a telescope to watch the stars and planets above.
But paleontology is my main work. I think I will specialize in the Jurassic Perios, when the Tyrannasaurus and Triceratops abounded in the world. I don't think I will be married for I can't see myslef tied down with marital problems.... neither do I think I will be rich for the pay isn't so good as a paleontologist, but I like too much paleontology to give it up.
I would like to own a cabin cruiser with a nice powerful engine and a Ford Corsair*. I will also have to spend a lot of my time in New York (for there is an excellent museum there) and also in London the Natural History Museum.
At first, I don' t like the idea of being head of the Paleontogy Deptment but after about 25 years I am sure I will become the chief of Paleontology.  Words: 267
