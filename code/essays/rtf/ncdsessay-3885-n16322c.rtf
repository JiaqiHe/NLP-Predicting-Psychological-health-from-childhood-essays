I would like to be a nurse. Or a hairdresser. I would like to live on a patch of house's or bunglo's. And would like to go to France for my holidays. And see a bullfight. Then when I came home I would like to spring clean. I would go ridding every saterday. And I would go for a picnic every Sunday I could have stripped pillow's and sheets and blue blankets and. a yellow bedspread I would have long hair which I would were in ringlets. I would were a orange dress with a blue hat for church I would hold Barbecue and cheese and wine partys. I would go fishing on Friday afternoon. I would hold garden partyes. I would have a red sports car which I would keep in a double garge. And in my bedroom I would have a blue swivle chair. I would read adventure books. The house I live in would be made of red brick.
