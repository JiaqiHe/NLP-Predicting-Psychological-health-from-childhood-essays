I am an officer in the Royal Air Force stationed at Neatished in Norfolk. I am flying Lightning Jets now but we are getting somthing better soon. Out job (if there was a war on) would be to guard the Norfolk coast against raiders. I have got two children and my wife, Linda, is going to have another one soon. The childrens names are Rodney and Frances. My hobby is building model aircraft and I am building one for multi R/C. At the end of the year we hope to have our new aeroplanes.  Words: 94
