When I am twenty five I would like to have a job as a nurse. I like nursing very much and I hope I will be able to pass the Exams for it.
      I would also like to have a husband, some children and a house of our own. 
      I hope that when my children grow up one of the girls will be a nurse just like I want to be.
      I would like to live in [location] because I have many friends and relatives here and because it is nice and quiet. 
      In my spare time I would enjoy knitting for my family and perhaps I might join the womens Institute  Words: 114
