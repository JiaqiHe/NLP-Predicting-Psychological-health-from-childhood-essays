I have left college by now, and have a job as a secutary which brings in alot of money. I don't intend to stay a spinster and have a boy friend called [male name] whom I met at colledge. I get on very well with the rest of my family especially my mother. who by now is getting on a bit. I live in a rented room of a house in [area of London] that belongs to some very nice people and I'm very interested in cooking as I used to do alot when I was young and also typing and things like that and so I took up being a secutary. I have made lots of friends since I left college but I don't go out much as I can't affod it. As I have all ready said I want to get married but I also want to bring up a family.  Words: 153
