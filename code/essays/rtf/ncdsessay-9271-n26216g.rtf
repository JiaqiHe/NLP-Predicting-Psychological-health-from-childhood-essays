I woke up one day at six,o,clock. I rushed down stairs and had a quick breakfast of bakon and eggs. I then walked out of the house and on the the farm. I went into one of the chicken houses and got a feeder. I filled up the trolly and went into the house. I put a bit of food into every holder. I went back and then went through the houses to look for dead chickens I found some. I put them into a bucket and took them to a pit were I put them. There were a lot of flies around the place but they wier'nt bothering me. I went back and dove the tractor round to the back of the cjicken house. I some sharings wich I put into the trailer. I drove the tractor round to the door. I got the shavings out of the trailer and took them into the house. I found a leek. The drinking thing had overflowed I cleaned out the shavings and put some clean shavings into the place. where the flood had been.
The next day was the day for the food lorry to come. I quickly went to the place were the lorry was to come.
