I am twenty five years old. I got married one year ago. I live in a bungalow with my husband. I am a hairdresser, also I teach dancing on Thursday's.
My husband works as a school teacher, he brings lots of work home at night to mark. In the morning my husband takes my son [male name] to school. Jeffery is five years old and he started school six months ago. [male name] has alot of friends and one of the friends dad is a very posh business worker. Today is Monday so I have to go and work at the hairdressers.
Next year in March all the family is going to Canada to live, so we are going too. 
Soon my husband and Jeffery will be coming home for their dinners. Today we are having Yorkshire puddings, mashed potatos, beef and carrots'. I am going to get it ready now. Later after we have had tea we are all going to see my mum and dad. On Saturdays when [male name] is in bed fast asleep my husband and I will go to my mum and dad's and we will all go out somewhere. On this Sunday if it is fine we will all go out to the seaside for the day. 
Sunday is fine and we are going to Blackpool for the day. We enjoyed it very much but now it is time to go home. We are home now I have just put [male name] to bed. We are having a cup of coffee and then we went to bed.  Words: 261
