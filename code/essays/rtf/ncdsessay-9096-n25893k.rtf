I have a house which is in the country. There is a big garden round it. Around the garden is a short fence. I like gardening and keeping it neat and tidy. I like making dresses. I work in a office all week as a secertary. But when I am not I like doing housework keeping the house nice and tidy. In the grounds which we own around the house, there are some apple trees, plum trees, and black current bushes. Some of the garden is of vegitables and the other flowers. The house is very comfortable and cosy. I enjoy being a secertary.  Words: 104
