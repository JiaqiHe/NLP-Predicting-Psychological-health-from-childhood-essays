----------------------
I am 25, and getting older, I like to get out in the country and the quiet country side, but I also like shopping and buy presents for other people, I have my job to do and quite alot of work, I got a job when I was twenty training as a gymnast, and now I'm teaching at a club, now I only teach in the afternoon. In the mornings I like to stay in bed late, then go out and get my jobs done in the town, I lead a peaceful life really and I like to think about when I was a young child. I am not married and I live alone in a big house, but I sometimes have friends coming to stay. I like looking after plants and gardens. One day when its sunny and I'm on holidayI like going out with close friends, and spend the day out, and wet days come very often then I like to tidy the house and do some sewing. I still like modern things and pop records. I don't like being alone in the house but I have a dog and some other pets, and I have a maid who is a very good friend and kind and she helps me when I'm in difficulty. The village near by is small and not very popular. I go to church quite often and I help with sales and shows.  Words: 239
