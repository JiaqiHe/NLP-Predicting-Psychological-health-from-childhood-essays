At the age of 25 I would work in a garage tinkering with cars and my interests would be sport and angling. I would enjoy mending cars. In the holidays I would try and go abroad somewhere if not I would go to Scotland. When I get married I will hope to have a family and I would like them to enjoy life best eduacating them as possible. Every Saturday I would take the family out somewhere so that everyone could enjoy themselves. I would rather fancy a good a reasonable garage to work in so as to earn my living well enough to get a house in the countryside probabley some where in* Sussex or Middlesex. If I had children I would take them to the best school as possible in the neighbourhood. I would try to earn about 20 pounds a week so we woudn't have a hard life. At home I would relax for a bit before working in the garden to make look as pretty as possible.  Words: 171
