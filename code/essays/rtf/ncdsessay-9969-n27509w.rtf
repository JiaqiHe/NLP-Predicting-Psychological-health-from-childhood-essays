----------------------
I am leading a quiet life in a county home. The nearest shop is two miles away . I live near a caravan site and often go camping near the sea. About a quarter of a mile from an bronze age fort and have got a museum built beside it. I have got quite a good museum and I often add to it. I have mostly got phreastoric dinasour bones and some human relics. The tax out here is not to heavy and I get along well with the museum. The entry fee is five shillings and I only need to hire six men. I have quite a lot of American tourists coming here and the font is a good attraction. Near the museum is a childrens play pen which some mothers leave their children while they go around the museum. I often leave a well trusted man to look after the museum while I go sea fishing with my small boat. Sometimes I take other people with me in my boat for trips around the bay. The museum opens at ten o'clock in the morning till ten o'clock in the evening when we light it up. I play football for the village team sometimes but only as a reserve. At the nearby town there is a cinema where I go sometimes. I have to go to the town every week to get my groceries. From the balcony I have a lovely view of the sea and often look at the stars through my telescope. In the winter I have great difficulty to get to the town. Still the museum is a good job and I quite often get a generous American who pay more than five shillings.  Words: 288
