At 25 years of age I am leading a normal life. I am unmarried and I have got a 4 roomed flat. I am a shop-keeper most of the day, selling and cutting up meat for sixteen hours a day ecept for Thursday and Sunday. During the rest of the day I study insects, the way they live, the way they fight, hunt, eat and the way they sleep. When I lay in bed I think of the days when I was a school-boy, the lessons I had, all the schools I've been to where I had to leave to go to school all the teachers I used to have all my school mates extr. On Thursdays I go out with some friends, we go fishing, to places far from home and on the way we look at all the old buildings all the different kinds of banks and shops all the monuments and statues. On Sunday mornings I go over the park and play football after that I go round to my mums house and I take my mum dad and sister out to have a drink. After I take them home my mum gives me some dinner. I go home have a cup of tea turn the television on  Words: 211
