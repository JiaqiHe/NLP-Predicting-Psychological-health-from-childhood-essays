"I am 25 today. I do not have somany presants when I was 11, my husband brought a lovely dress and I am going to go to work in my dress. I work in a office ""typing"" I do filling and posting letters. I have been there 4 years now but I am getting quiet bored of it, because people are turning off of me. When I get to work I am going to show-off my new dress what I had for my birthday. I am at home now and I am cooking dinner for us two. When my husband gets home we are going to have dumppling and curry. At home my mother and father are 53 and 60, my husband and I are going to take my mother and father for a holiday to [town] for the week, and I have only one interest and that is climbing rocks"  Words: 151
