My age is 25. I am married with two children. They are a boy and a girl and their names are [name] and [name]. At half past eight in the morning I go to work. I like my job. It is not very hard. The work I do is to mend cars. My wage is very good the money is fourteen pound a week. I work for nine hours. I arrive home at quarter to six because the bus takes quarter of an hour to take me home. When I arrive home I drive my car to the factory for my wife then drive her home. I play with the children while my wife makes the tea. Some mornings when I donot have to go to work I drive the children to school and my wife to work. When their is nothing to do I go to the swimming baths. I go for a swim if the water is not cold. Some times I go in for races and if I win I recieve a cup. When I go home I put the cup in a chinecabnet along with the rest of the cups. Sometimes I go and watch the footballers play football. My favourite team is Newcastle United. When Iam at home people come and see me. They want me to come and fix their cars. Most of the cars have punctures.  Words: 233
