If I was 25 year's old. I would prob*bly be married and I would be going out to work. I would go to work and if I back children I would let them stay to dinner and have a job that ended around 5' o clock. I would not let my children play in the streets. I might be an ordinary housewife after I am about 29. everyday except for saturday and sunday I would work and on a weekend I would go shopping with my husband. My hobbies would be country dancing and maybe dress making. I would make my own clothes and not buy the*, because they would be very expensive. On Monday would be work and after I come home I would make the tea and about seven oclock I'd put the children to bed and finish all the odd job's I had to do. Before bed I would have a drink. On saturday I would not buy all canned food's, I would buy food that could be stored alway and then be used again.  Words: 178
