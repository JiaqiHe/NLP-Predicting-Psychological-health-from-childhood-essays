I am now 25 but I am still not married although I am not married I have a house with a swiming pool. I do not live in the city I live in the country because I like it to be quiet and I also like to do a lot of bird spotting. My favorite hobies are Golf, Football, Swiming, Critet and Tennis. There is one thing I am very proud of and that is my Benkley you may think I am rich having a Benkley but I am not you also might think I am a member of parliment but I am only an egineer. There is another reason I like staying in the country and that is because when I have to draw a plan of a car I am not bothered by all the noise. When I get my old age pension and I leave work I will still go drawing plans for all the cars. When I was younger I toured south Africa to see how the people live and to see all the cities. Whe I came from collage I did,nt now what to but one of my worked in a engineering buisness and he ask me if I wanted to have a go and I said yes because I needed a job and because I wanted the money.
