I am a Dentist and I live at a house (I rent it) I am not married I get up at 7 o'clock in the morning and set off for the school clinic at 8 o'clock. I have to take a boy's tooth out, and then see to many other peoples teeth. I a have a day off on Saturdays and *** that's when I do most of my work like cleaning **p and That sort of thing. And then at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I visit my mather and father . There I do a bit of enbroidery. and when I'm not doing any embroidery I look at some old pictures I like my job as a Dentis for it is interesting, there`s good wages and it helps people, which I am very pleased to do.
On Sundays I go tot he park and look at the lovely colourful flowers. Roses are my favourate flowers I always buy some for my mother for she likes them too. On mondays an other Dentist takes my place for a few hours and I go shopping I often go to town to buy new dresses (my favourite coloures are red, pink and yellow)  Words: 201
