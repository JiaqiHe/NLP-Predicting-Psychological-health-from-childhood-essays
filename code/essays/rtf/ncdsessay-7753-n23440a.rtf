I am now driving a lorry and have a family. The lorry that I have carriyes loads of fish and othere thing. It usualy is on the road going down south to (place) and places like that. some times I might get a puncher but not very often.
On my way up I sometimes bring tractors wood and electricity thing. On the way down and up I usualy take samebade with me. Once when I was at (place) I had my load taken of less than half an hourwhich is not usual.
It sometimes takes a week and a half to go down and up again but it just yeualy takes one we*k. I like driving the lorry driver it number is (registration number) . It is a Leyland and is thirty feet long.
Some times I have to go to (place) and sometimes further north than that. When I go as far north as that I sometimes take a load with me like a cabin for a boat.
It is comfortable to drive up and down the moter way all day long. I just hope that that will happen when I am twenty five .  Words: 192
