As I awoke I got ready and opened the door of the barracks theng* walked towards the airfield. I headed towards the control tower on the airfield, I recived my orders that I should fly around the airfield for a few times in a gnat aircraft. So I went towards a hanger and taxied to the begining of the runway with my jet engines roaring to go. Suddenly I heard a bump and I was off the ground flying over the small airfield. An hour later I found that my fuel was running out so I decided to land. When I landed I went towards the kitchen for my dinner, the food is not very god in the R.A.F. but I do not mind. In the afternoon I useually help checking out the planes. I check out the under carriage and the jet engines and sometimes I have to clean them out. Then at three o'clock I went to test out some new planes so I went towards a other hanger. I had to fly the planes ten times round the airport. They were all kinds of aircrafts some were vulcans, guat* and lightnings all hard to fly. At teatime we have tea and then we go into town and go in the pictures. At ten o'clock sharp we have to be back at the barracks in bed and the lights turned out at half past. Then we start again in the morning if it is a ordinary day. If it is a show I go in a plane and showoff.  Words: 261
