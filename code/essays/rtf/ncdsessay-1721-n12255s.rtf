"I go to work every day as I am an interpreter and I am always need if not on a job abroad then in the office. Every morning I meet uncle Walter ( the marketing director) and ask him what I've got this morning though I know he'll say something like ""oh, a dozen or so French, German & Spanish letters to interpretate "" or ""Get ready I've got a trip to Germany for you""
     My home-life is quite a different matter really, at weekends my husband & myself (I am married)! Go down to **** to see my Parents and go back on the Sunday evening, but sometimes we stay at home with a big box of chocolates. 
     My interests and hobbys are nothing very exciting I suppose. Although I enjoy a good game of tennis or an opera (this is very occasionally). Also I like horse riding sometimes or going to see askow* such as the West Midland Show. 
     i lead a very busy life &* and so does my husband but when we do both get a holiday we really enjoy ourselves."  Words: 187
