When I am about 25 years old I hope to have two children and also be married. If my children are about 4 or 5 years old I would like them to go to a nursery school so that I can go to work. I would like to train to be a nurse before I have any children so that it would be easy to just pick up from where I left off. Also I like to be able to drive a car and live in a nice bungalow. I would like to work up to a staff nurse so that I would have quiet a bit of money for my childrens cloths and toys like a swing and see-saw. In the evenings I would like to watch the T.V. and some other evenings go to dances and have a baby sitter to look after my children while my husband and I are out. I would like my husband to be a police-man.  Words: 163
