When I am twenty five I would like to be a hairdresser because I like coming peoples hair and I like washing hair. I am not going to get married because I think its better to live on your own then you could go to the pictures nearly every night straight from work but if you got married you would have to come home and give your husband his tea saw thats why I dont wan't to get married. I want to live in a flat because a flat is quite big and you have a cupboards every where. Why I want to live in a flat because I like the vew you can see miles and miles away. I have always wanted to be a hairdresser since I was a little girl.  Words: 133
