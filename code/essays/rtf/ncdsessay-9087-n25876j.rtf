At the age of twenty five I am leading a interesting life as a air hostess. I fly & work for B.O.A.C.. When we have flown somewhere such as Gibralter we may have to stay there for three or four days. I have quite a lot of pay and I am able to buy new dressess quite frequently to keep up the fasion. It is quite nice to spend part of my life in different parts of the world. Whilst at home I take lesson on Ballroom dancing. I also go to the bowling alley. I ahve a collection of records with mostly classical music on. I can't sew. so whilst at home I go to look in the shops to see if I can find any nice dresses. I also do skechtinng in my spare time. I used to go to art lessons. But seeing I am a airhostess now I haven't any time to go.  Words: 157
