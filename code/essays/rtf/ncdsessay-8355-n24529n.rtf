I am leading a good life. I wouldn't say that I was rich or poor. I'm still living with my family and I am not married. I have a boyfriend who is very nice and we plan to get married when we are at least 27. I have lots of nice friends and some are friends which I have had ever-since I was at school. I have quite a few intrests which include, singing, looking after, children, listening to the radio and other music. I like reading writing and poetry. At home I work in the house read books and sing to the children I sometimes look after. In the evenings I go out with my boyfriend to social clubs and cinemas. Some times we go to my friends house and listen and dance to reciords. My family and I can't afford to go abroad so our holidays consist of outings and tours. I have three brothers who are all at work. and we plan beetween us to send our parents on a cruise for there golden wedding aneversery.
I work at a grammer school teaching English and Music. I enjoy music very much. I have three pets: a cat, a dog, and a mouse. My boyfriend comes from a very good family and he has two sisters and 1 brother. My parents and his are very friendly. and I am quite friendly with his sisters.  Words: 235
