Being twenty five, I of course now have a job. I am secretary to Mr. [name], manager of '[company]'. My job is to type out any letters or notes he wishes me too, or any other short-hand notes. My sister is only twenty three, and she is training to be a nurse, while my brother, who is nearly twenty two, has joined the army. I enjoy my job, like I did school, but I am always glad to get home. At the moment, I am looking forward to the dance my boyfriend is taking me out to. I am engaged to him. We have arranged that [name] should come and call for me in his new sports car. I must tell you about it. Its absoulutly fab! It a lovely red colour, with the new type of hair dryer fixed to the controls. Its jolly handy. Last week, I was going for a ride in it, with John. But it pelted with rain, and I'd only just washed my hair. But it didn't matter much. I styled it again with the hair dryer. Well, I'm getting of the subject now. [name] was going to pick me up, and we'd go from there to the dance. Actually, I've bought a present for him. Its a blue polar neck shirt, and a tie to match. Well, I've got to go now, I'll miss my hovercraft. Bye!  Words: 234
