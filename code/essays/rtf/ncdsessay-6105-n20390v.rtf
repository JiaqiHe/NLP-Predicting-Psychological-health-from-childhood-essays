I am married and I have one child. I am trying to get a job as a district nurse. but some-times I think it wil be hard work and I think about hairdressing. My husband is a customes officer. and my little boy will be starting shcool this summer. My home is in the country as it is quiter than the town where I used to live. My father is still working at Parkest*ne, but my mother has* left and become a house-wife. I do not like house work. So that is why I am getting a job. I will get a job where I will be able to see my husband and son when I come home way-night. It is now morning and I am setting of to finel a job. my little boy is with my mother-in-law as my mother lives to far away. There is a hair dressing salon about two or three miles away so I will try th** final. I am now there, there on the door is a notice bord is a sign which says (helper wanted) I go in side and sab** all about it. I said Thank you I will have a go and see whats its like. I go home and tell my husband all about it he is very pleased. and asks *** when I start I tell him I start on monday my little boy said he wants to come and watch I said no. It is now monday I start my new job I like it very much indeed.  Words: 261
