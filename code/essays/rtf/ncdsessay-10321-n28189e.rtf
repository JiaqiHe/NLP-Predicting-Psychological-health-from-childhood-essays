I help my mum very often I pop off for a chat I would I would do all diffrent kinds of work each day stay in *n all the week. but go out on saturday and sunday I would go out to word as a sectary if I could get a job. I would maybe take up a job of dressmaking to make some money (fore the family) I moved go out at night with myself go to the pictures on go to a dance are maybe nothing at all. I would wash up and other things to help my mum on any body I would lay on the bed listening to the wireless if I could. I would go to dances come home and go to bed very early when arive home at about twelve o clock at night I would make up get the breakfast and then go to work I would call to my friends on the way and pick on up if she worked were I did.
