When I am 25 I hope to be a footballer playing for Sheffield United but it is very hard trying to be a footballer. But at the time I am 25 I might be married I might even take up reeding books but I dout it I would like I say in Sheffield but go abroad to Spain for my holidays. Spain is known to be a nice play my aunty's been and she said it was very nice When I am 25 I will keep going Swiming because it is one of my best hobies. When I am 25 I will not smoke but I will drink I will go out to clubs on Saturday and Sunday and enjoy my self when it is sunny I will go out. If I don't get the job of been a football I hope to be a man who work at davy's United or brown baily's like my dad works now.  Words: 159
