When Iam 25 years old I hope to be a famous Athletic or a famous footballer. And run in the Olimpic Games or play football in other countrys. And go to other countrys for holidays. I would like to be a trainer in Athletics. When I get married I would like to have a house in the country. And I would like to have a swimming pool outside in the garden. I would Have a green house and grow tropical flowers, I would make a shop to sell the flowers. I would have a dog and a budgie as a pet. I would train the dog to sit, fech a stick or a ball if I throw it. I'd train the budgie to speak and to go on my finger. If I could not do all this I'd be an electricion or a decorater or a builder.  Words: 147
