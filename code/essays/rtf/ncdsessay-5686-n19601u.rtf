I work at a hospital in [town]. I am training to be a State Registard Nurse. My work is very interesting, I go and watch surgeons perform operations. At my first operation I fainted but the Sister said many nurses do that at their first operation. I have a very nice room in the Nurses Quarters where I keep my pop records and reading books. Sometimes When ever I can I go over to my home to see my parents. They always make me welcome when I go. I am glad to see my old friends, and sister. I have just the one sister who is married. Her husband is name [name]. As I work as a nurse I dont have much time for boy-friends. I just love looking after children which is what my work is about. One little girl is parilysed from the waist downwards. She is name [name]. You get some terrible cases in there from alsorts of accidents. I hope to stay in my nursing career untill I retire.
