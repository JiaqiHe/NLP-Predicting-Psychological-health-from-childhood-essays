I've got a job in a office . I like it there I have a lot of friends . Then at night I have to go home and make the tea for my husbend and children . I have two children one is two years and the other three . Their granney looks after them while I go to work . We live in a four roomed house . I get on very well with my husband . His job is a bank manger. I am going to give up my jo* in the office to spend more time with my children . The pay is very good at the office . I don't go out very often. nether does my husband go out . The children's names are (name) and (name) . (name) is four on her birthday . (name) birthday is past . I like the children a very lot . We have quite a big garden . The children sometimes get filthy . And sometimes I get very annoyed at them .They are always up to some mischief . I am very sad to be leaving the office . But I thought it would be better if I stayed at home with my children .  Words: 208
