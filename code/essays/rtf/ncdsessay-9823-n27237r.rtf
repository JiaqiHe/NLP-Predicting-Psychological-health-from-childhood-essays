I am a nursrey teacher in the day time, and my work starts at 9o,Clock and finishes at 3,30 when I get home I will tide up up and the start make tea. I am not married because I dont who to and my mind is hookyoupied on my nursry work. When I have finished my tea I will go to my other hobby (ballet,) I will work hard for two hole hour like I could remember when I was ten. When it was my fist time on block toes and now I am very good at it. Now I will get on to tell you something: My mum comes to see every Saturday and Sunday which are the two day rest from School. Now you know my best bit in life I will end this Story. THE END  Words: 139
