I am leading a happy life. I work out of doors I am interested in Scating and I would like to learn to ride. My home is covered with pictures and the I am either helping at riding stables or painting pictures. My work will be mixed and I am enjoying myself. My life and work will live outside in the country I do not like lonleyness but sometimes I like to be on my own. I like living in the country I like the sweet scent of rosed and other flowers. I also like animal all kinds of animals. I would not like to work in a factory. I like the contryside and its fresh air. I do not like smoky towns with smoky chimneys in them. My interests will do something to my life. My home will be in the country. I will not live to far away from enyone else but I am surronded by sweet smeling flowers and fresh green grass. Birds sing in the morning and a new day starts. I start work by helping clear the riding stables. I have not yet got a horse of my own and I know I never will. I like drawing horses Galloping trotting cantering and jumping. I draw wild horses sitting down in heards and some will stand up while others munch the sweet green grass. Others roll about the floor to get rid of the iches. Others swish their tails and whinny for their young. I know my dreems will not come true. Horses and ponies cost hundreds and hundreds of pounds. I am learning to ice dance.  Words: 272
