My name is [name] and I am 25 years of age. My main interests in life is to become a deiginer in clothes and to live in a city in my own house. I lead a very happy life with my husband who also dezinges clothes and with my two children [name] and [name]. Now I am traing at my husbands school for deziners and wish to be leaving* very soon. [name] who is 7 is at a bording school but comes to see me every weekend. [name] who is 3 goes to a nursery while I am at work. The house I live in is a large bunglow. We have a very big* garden as my husband is very intrested in gardening. The children have a cat and a rabbit but they would be very pleased if they had a dog.  Words: 142
