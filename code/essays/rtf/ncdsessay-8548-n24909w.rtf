When I'm 25 I would like to work with Planes and disining them, all so fling. There's an airfield near us caled faishs* were I would like to fly. I would all so like to be married with 1 boy and 1 girl. I would like to be at home a bit and not work on Saturday or Sunday. I would like to have a car and a nice house. And play with my children. I hope to work with other people and be happy at my work. I would like to work at home but go to London once or twice a week.  Words: 104
