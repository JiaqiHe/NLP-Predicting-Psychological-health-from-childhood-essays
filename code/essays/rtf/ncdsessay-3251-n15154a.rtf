When I am twenty five years old, I will have bought a house and would be happily settled down with my husband. I would probaly have a little baby by then. If I had no baby, I would still be going to work. My interests would be in swimming, as I enjoy swimming very much. I would go to a swimming pool some days, and teach children how to swim. Some nights I would go out with my old friends, to a dance or party, or anything like that. My house would be in the contry somewhere. So I would have to go into town, to go to a dance or party. My husband would have bought a car, for us, and I would be learning how to drive. When I have lernt how to drive, I would be going into town in the car, and doing all the shopping. Some days I would go back to see my old schools, just to see if any of the teachers I new were there. When I have nothing to do I will go to see my sister, [female name], and would ask her to come and visit us sometimes. As well as doing that, I will also be going out to see my mum and dad. and ask them how [male name] and [female name] are. [male name] and [female name] are my youngest brother and sister. As well as erning money for me and my husband, I will have to give some of it to mum and dad. Mum always says that I have got to give her some, when I grow up. We would have finished our hunny-moon by now, and would be back doing this.  Words: 287
