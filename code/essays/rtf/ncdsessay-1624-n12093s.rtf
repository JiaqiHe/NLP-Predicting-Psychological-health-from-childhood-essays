I have one child called (name), she is only two but is extremely energetic. In my spare time I design clothes and furniture and act. Having a young child has its disadvantages; I can not go abroad filming for any length of time because of the baby, who does not like being left alone just with his nammy (my mother.) ButIdo not regret having had her.
My husband also is in the acting world and he is a producer. We are quite well off and have a large house and garden in the country and a little flat up in London. I lead a very happy life.  Words: 106
