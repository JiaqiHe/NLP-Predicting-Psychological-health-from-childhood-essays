I am an air - pilot and I fly a Trident 144. The trident is a large jet and can travel at six hundred miles per hour. The firm is [company]. They own twenty one jets and are all Tridents. I earn about one hundred pounds per week and so am able to buy and run, a Ferrari. To be an air pilot you must be very inteligent and have good sight. Apart from flying a jet, when I get time off I also go glider flying. On the safer side I like to play the guitar and collect matchbox tops. At home my wife, [name] does most of the housework, while I have do dig the garden and jobs similar. The house is called [house] and it is in the private estate of [estate] near Deavon. At the age of six I went to Italy and at nine I went to Yugoslavia and at ten years I went to Spain. I am very pleased with my progress and to believe that ar at eleven I thought I'd never make it. Deavon is a quiet place and we are very pleased to be here. The people are very friendly and we all enjoy a night at the tavern. My garden covers three acres of land of which one is an orchard, one a garden and one is which where I breed my dogs. Altogether I breed six kinds of dogs of which my favourite is a St. Bernard. The others are dalmations, * - cairn terriers, setters, dachunds, and labradors. When I recieved my passes that said I was able to be an air - pilot I was extremely pleased with myself.  Words: 282
