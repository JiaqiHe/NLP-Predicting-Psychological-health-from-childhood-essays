My name is [female name] [surname]. My age is 25 years old. I work at a hairdressers named Saloon Six. Every morning I wake up at 7.30 o Clock. I have ceral for brekfast. I leave for the hairdressers at 4 minutes to 8. Then I start a hard days work. My interests are Swimming, reading, drawing and I hope to become a top hairdresser. I am married and I have two children [female name] who is 9 and [female name] who is 11.
On my day off which is Wednesday I take the children to the zoo, only on their holidays of course. On Sunday we all go to the church in the morning. Then in the afternoon we go up to the moors in our Cortina.
We lead a hard life for we have to live off my wages and of course my husbands too.
On our Summer holidays we went to Holland were my cousin lives, she lives in Goes, which is a few hundred miles away from Rotterdam. [female name] my cousin, has just bought a black and white cat named tibbles. Tibbles has just had kittens, so [female name] gave one to me.
Then back we went to England sage and sound with one more to our family. My home is a very nice cottage near a river side which is near the moors.
Now and again I go to the local swimming baths and practise swimming and diving. The coach there says I am very good indeed. I hope the rest of my life will be enjoyable as when I was 25.  Words: 263
