MY LIFE
I am 25 years old I am married and have a child of 5. Every day I go out to my riding stables with [female name], my daugter, get the Land Rover, put Sago in the back of the car, and drive off out of the stable yard and down the hill to the fields at the bottom. I stop at the gate of the big field and get out of the car with [female name], I then let Sago out, so that he can have a morning run. Then I collect the Headcoller's. (which I have previosly collected from the tack room) from the car, [female name] takes some. Then we go into the field and call the ponies to us, [female name] cathes the smaller ones, most of which are easy to catch, while I catch the bigger ones. The ponies which are very hard to catch have their headcollers left on in the field, so that we can just take hold of the headcoller and they are caught. By this time, it should be about nine o'clock, and the girls who help at the riding school, ([female name], [female name], [female name] and [female name]) should be here. [female name] can ride quite well now, because she was 'born in the saddle' so to speak. But one of the girls usually lead her on Dusk, a little dark grey pony, with a blaze, on the road. [female name] rides Willie, [female name] rides Zephy, these ponies are sliver grey twins, gelding and mare.  Words: 257
