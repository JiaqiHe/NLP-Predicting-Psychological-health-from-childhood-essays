If I was twenty five I would like to be teacher or a head misstress. But you would have to go to college And you would have to know every thing to tell your children. But if I get married I would go to paris for my honeymoon. If my mother and father were still alive I would go to their house every sunday but still go to holy mass. But we might emagrate to some were and live there for two year's. But my husband would get a car and it would be a hillman. We would go out in it and go on our Holiday's. I do not want baby's because they would be too much bother and I have not got alot of patience. If I worked my mam she would hit me. She has not got a lot of patience and she is bad tempered so is my dad if they have a fight my dad he is very bad temperd and angrey. My nanna and granda were very bad tempered if she did any knitting and she made a mistake she used to pull the whole lot out.  Words: 193
