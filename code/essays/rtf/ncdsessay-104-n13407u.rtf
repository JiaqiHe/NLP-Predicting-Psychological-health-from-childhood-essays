I am now working and I have a horse which I go into shows with. I love swiming. And I have a house of my own and garden. I work at the electbord and I show people round the building. I do the cleaning my self and I make some of my dresses. I have a car which I go shoping in ever morning I can go a long way in a car. I earn about 3s per hour but that is enough if I work about 9 hours. I read much more now I am older. I like colecting china and glass and horse brasses which I hang on my wall. I like singing but I can't. I can also get some of the electric things a bit cheper, because I work for them.  Words: 135
