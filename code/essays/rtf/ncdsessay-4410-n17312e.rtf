When I am 25 I hope to be married and perhaps have a child. I would like to work in a bank. I would like to be fairly rich. As an interest I would still go ballroom dancing. On Sunday I would like to have a lay in and perhaps have breakfast in bed. I would like to lead a casual life. I would try to go to bed early. Whilst I am downstairs and watching television I would probably be doing some knitting or some sewing. I would let my child stay up till about 9 o'clock and if they went to bed early I would let them read or write. If they went to school I would make them do their homework as soon as they came home from school. If they didn't I would not let them watch any television. We would have supper about 6o'clock. I would not allow the television (if we had one) to be on until supper was finished. At work I would like to be working with figure adding up, subtracting, multiplying and dividing. I wouldn't mind doing decimals which I would be dealing with. At home I would like to have tiles on all floors and most rooms carpeted. All the rooms wallpapered. Net curtains in all rooms and coloured curtains. I would like to live naer the sea. I would go to the sea whenever the day was clear and warm.  Words: 241
