Well if I where 25 I would start as an art teacher in a University for part time. And I would get a decent job and now and then go a holiday to America. Any spare time I would build models and draw for compititions. I would look after my mother even if I were married. If I get children I would send them to a good school for a good education. I would tell my children to do some art once and a while and become an art teacher when they grow up and get married and tell there children the same about art.  Words: 105
