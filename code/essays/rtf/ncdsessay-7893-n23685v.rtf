I've just had my 25th birthday and going to emigrate to Brizil in two weeks time. I go to London airport and get on a privet plane, then I go over the mederterraming. I'm going to go up in the forest to catch some birds and make a wild fowl trust over there, but first I need permishon from the goverment to set up one then I need permishon from the council. First I have to save some money to buy some land I need about 80 arcers with a lake so that I can keep some water fowl. I have saved 2,000 pounds and need about 3,00 to set up a avery. When I arrive I shall be taken to a train station where a train shall take me to a hotel in the town. I used to work at [village] wildfowl trust witch is owend by [male name] [surname]. I am not marride yet so I dont have to reserve a dobble bedroom at the hotal. Before I go over to Brizil I have to go to the doctor to have some injections to stop me having malaria which is a dissise that makes you have a fever. three weeks ago I had 100 pound from the bank witch my uncle left me in his will. Next year I may come back to Britain to see my parents again. Yesterday I won xxxx3 at bingo. My suitcases are going to be taken in another plane but I am taken one with me.  Words: 254
