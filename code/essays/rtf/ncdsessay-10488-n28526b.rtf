If I were twenty five I would be working in an office being a short hand typist earning a lot of money I would probably have married and got a baby and you have to earn wich children because children wan* a lot of nice clothes and toys and that takes away a lot of money I would be leading a happy life I hope and have a good husband. If I did not have any children I would go out nearly every night earlier to the cinama or to the clubs. I would do all the house work then put my trousors on and go into the garden and plant and water the plants. I will get a house that has a big garden so I can spend my lesure time in it. I would not tel my husband touch it because he might spoil it I will have a lot of pets in the garden I will have a lot of pets in the garden I will have a rabbit and a guini pig and a dog in the house I will have an aquariam a cat and a bugerigar. I will train the bugerigar to say its name and address so if it gets lost the people will be able to return if I do not want a big family I wand two girls and one boy. But you see if I have a family I will not go out to work so I would be able to have office work at home and still earn the same money I would have a touch typwriter. so I would be able to write typ much quicker. My most interesting thing I do is my gardening. The sort of dog I would have is a golden labroudour. and a simese car and a yellow bugerygar.  Words: 306
