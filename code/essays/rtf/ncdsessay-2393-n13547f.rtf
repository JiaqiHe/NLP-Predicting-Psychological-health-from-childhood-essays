I have just left my last job and I want a new one, so I am going home to ask my parents what shall I Be. They thought and thought then my father said why not Be a motor machanic and later on you might Be a racing Driver, I paused for a minute and then I siad to my mother what do you think, she said I dont know you lead your own life. Weeks and weeks past I could not think what to do, until one day I saw a notice at a shop window motor machanic wanted at Cleveland Garage apply within. I went to the garage like a shot Im your man I said.
two years past now Im as happy as ever Becouse Im a racing driver. and I earn my own living  Words: 137
