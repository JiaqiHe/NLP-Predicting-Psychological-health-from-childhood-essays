I have been spending my time at school trying to become an engineer but now I am one. I have to work from morning to night at work. Sometimes I work over night and still working in the morning. The wages are xxxx18.10/6d a week. when I come home my supper is always ready for me and after my tea I sit down to a comfortable chair and read the news. Then I fix the alarm clock to six o'clock in the morning and I get about 8 hours sleep then I am up to work again. and I do enjoy working sometimes while I am of work some engines of cars need to be fixed so I sometimes help them and fix their engine and my brother is an engineer to and he likes it very much . He would just do the same as me but at work his wages they are xxxx19/12/3 d . and he works all night to and sometimes he sends me letters. and tells me about his work.  Words: 175
