When I grow up and turn 25 years I would like to be a hairdresser.
If you be a hairdresser you need to go to college and learn to cut hairs and set wigs up to.
When I be a hairdresser am some-body said can you sort my wig for me you would just need to say yes you just can't say know or the lady go and tell everyboby that you can't set wigs yet. another thing you would need to learn to put rollers, in and cut hair, straight, wash hairs, and after you have done that you would to put them under the drier. When I am 25 may be I will be married and by a baby and then may be I will need to stop work-ing. If you are a hairdresser you get about xxxx10 for 6 days just on other thing if I do leave my work i would get mo pay my husband would meed to work hard for money more than xxxx10 a week because I would meed to buy the baby clothes, a pram, a go-chair, shoes, and many other things as well . When the baby grows up and gets to school I could start to work again but only a another job and that would be typist . If you where a typist you would need to go to college to. you would need to learn to type words, and letters, and sometimes when you can type well you may be get a modal or may be some money or even a prize.
