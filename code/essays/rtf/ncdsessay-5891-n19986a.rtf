----------------------
I am 25 years old I have a young child of 6 months. It's name is Ruth My husband is in the wood working trade. I am an ordinary house wife doing the old jobs around the house. My jobs are things like, cooking, ironing, making the beds and things like that. I decided that I did'nt want a job for it would be to much like hard work what with the baby as well.
My interests in the family home are things like collecting dolls in national costume I am glad that I have finished school now for it is great having a young child around the house and a husband around at night time after after the child is in bed when the child is in bed my husband and I sit down together and rest together after a long day of hard work My wish, when I am married is to have a fairly big house with a sun lounge at the back of it, where when I have my 2 children they can play while I do the jobs around the house  Words: 185
