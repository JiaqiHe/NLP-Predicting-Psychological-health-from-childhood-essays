When I am twenty - five I am going an air-hostess on the (company) airlines. I would like to have a set of twins as my children both girls. I would name them (name) and (name). I would teach them to swim when they are young . and when they are older they would go to dancing and piano lessons. I would have a bungalow as my house with fitted carpets in each room and I would have lace curtains in the windows. I would have central heating. and I would have a **ppe* dog called (name). and I would also have a great-dane. My most favorite hobbies would be swimming and knitting and sewing. I would have a car. My life would be happy I would spoil the twins If I have them. I would have a nursery for the twins. My husband I hope will be tall dark and handsome with blue eyes. I would marry before I was twenty. I would live out on the country side. and I would have a big garden with lots of lovely flowers in it. The twins would have a birthday party everyyear until the are thirteen The will be kind to each other and never quarrel* We would go away on holiday every year . This is the life I would lead at the age of twenty five.  Words: 228
