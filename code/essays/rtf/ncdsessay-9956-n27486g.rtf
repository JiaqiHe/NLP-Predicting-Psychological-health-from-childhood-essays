At the age of 25 I might be in the army tank corps* learning how to drive fire its guns and how to repair one. I think it would be a great live we would go on training missions camping out in tents and perhaps we might go abroad keeping the peace around the worl some of the sports I am intrested in are fishing football and archery I take a very great inrest* in fishing now and I plan to carry on fishing all my life one of the fish I would like to catch is pike because they put up a very good fight. I might also be in the army* football team if I am luckey it is a great sport but I would rather go fishing. One of my other hobbeys is Autchery and I am quiet a good shot with a bow. I do not no yet wether I will get married or not.  Words: 159
