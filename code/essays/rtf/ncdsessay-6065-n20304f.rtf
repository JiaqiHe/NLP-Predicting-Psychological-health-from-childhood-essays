My life at 25 years of age.
My job is a hairdresser. I have my own hairdressing salon in (town). When I go to work in the morning I start at 9.00 and finish at 6.00. When I close the shop at night I go home have my tea, and then get ready to go out. Wh-en I am all ready I go out. I usauly go dancing or skating at (place). Sometimes I dont go out because there maybe something on television At home I do as I like, but there is one kind of rule which is, if I go out I am to-be back by 11 30 sharp. I love to go skating dancing and bowling. I would also like to meet some of the pop stars. As I told you before I have my own hairdressing salon. The girls who work with me are very pleasant. I think when you have got your own shop, you can do anything you like to it. I find that sometimes you meet intresting people. At home I have my own bedroom, which I can decorate to my own likeing. I have two meals at home, they are breakfast and tea. Dinner I have at work with the other girls. I would like to go to America to see the Niagara falls, someday I might get there I think to myselF. My Friend and I go to night corsies at a collage to take cooking. My friend has got a red sports car, and she takes me for rides in it after work. We often go to a cafe and have a snack.
