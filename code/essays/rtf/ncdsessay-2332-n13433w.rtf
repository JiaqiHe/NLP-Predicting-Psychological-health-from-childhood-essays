If I was 25 years old I would be a house wife My husband will be working at the steel. works. I would wash up the pots and wash my chilldren clean. If I was a teacher I wouldn't no what to do because there is no one to watch the chilldren no one to give them the dinners. I would have a baby siter from 16-18. Not a younger one because I wouldn't trust them they could hit my chilldren for carring on and smokeing. At their age. If my chilldren come in mucky I would shout at them for going in the mud. Then I would say to them you are not going out anymore for today. You've been told of your father not to go in the mud. They would get hit of thier father very hard I would clean the house nearly ever day. Because the chilldren are playing and making a mess on the floor. They will have their diNNers in the back kitchen. I would have my husbands dinner in the oven ready for him coming in it would be hot for him. I would leave my chilldren fetch their friends in the house. I would leave them go to the baths while I go shopping to the town or [town]. While the chilldren are at the nursey I could get tidy up for their teas. They will go to bed a half-past eight and get up at 8-oclock.
