----------------------
I am now married I have been for two years and expecting my first child. I work as a short-hand typist and hoping to become a secretary of a big firm. I have not a lot of time to spare for reading books as I would like to. 
      I go to work about eight thirty and start at nine, and finish about five. When I reach home I have to put the dinner on for my husband who is in about six-thirty. As we live in [city] it takes quite a long time to come home as of the rush-hour.
      At the night time I usally stay in and knit. I would like a baby boy first, then a girl then a boy and last of all a girl. Some-times at the weekend my husband and I go out somwhere. 
At the moment we are living in a flat but we are hoping to get a house some-where other than [city]. On a Saturday when I do the shopping I useally go and have a cup of tea with my friend back at her house until about two then go back home, to cook the dinner. 
      After the baby is born my husband the child and I hope to go to Hawaii for a holiday it should be round about July to August.  Words: 225
