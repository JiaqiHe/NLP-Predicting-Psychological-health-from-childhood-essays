Today is Saturday and I do not have to go to work.
      I will be going into [town] to do some shopping. My car is a Mini-Minor which I had when I was 21. In the afternoon I will be going to see [football club] play [football club] at the [football ground].
      The first shop I have to go to is Sainsburys, then I will go to Market and finally I will go to Boots for some soap and other toilet requisites. Now the shopping is all done I go home and make my dinner. For dinner on Saturdays I usually have chips, egg, bacon, and tomatoes. I also read the paper, which is the Daily Mirror. It is time for me to Start out for the football match. I will not go by car because everywhere will be crowded with Shoppers and surporters.
      After the match I come home quickly. and tidy the house up and also do a little gardening. Then I have my tea which consists of beans on toast cake and a cup of coffee. After tea I wash up and clear-away my tea things. Now I do some washing and hang it out on the line, and also finishing the gardening. The time being 7hrs 30mins I bring in the washing and fold it up. Now I have done all the jobs I need to, I will read untill the football comes on tele-vision then watch the football. After that I will go to bed.  Words: 250
