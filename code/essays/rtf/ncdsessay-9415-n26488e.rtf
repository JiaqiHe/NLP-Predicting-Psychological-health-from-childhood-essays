My work is a nurse and I find in intesting. At the age I am now you would find nursing interesting. My home life is studying different things that I did not no about before I was a nurse. You can keep your home life safe know what are drigs and not let the children or any other person eat them. You also know if someone is ill what illness they have got. Know what is healthy and know things that are not healthy. The other nurses at the hospital are very kind to me. So the life I am leading is very interesting. 
Some times at the hospital you get some rather naste cases. Some of the patient are rude and are not very cheerful so I help to cheer them up. The children ward is very nice. I play with them and I am nice to them and in return they help me with my work. I have a six month old baby girl she is very cute. Her name is [female name]. My husbands name is [male name] I like him. My home life is very nice to and it is interesting  Words: 195
