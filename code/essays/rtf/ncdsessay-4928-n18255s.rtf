The age of 25 I won't get marred. I would go out to sea on the ships go to places like New York Spain paris and many other places I would go to. About two or three years later I would stop going to places and get a job like be a famous teleivison star or open a store at a market or just get a job at a places. I gould do jobs at home like be a gardener or decorrate the rooms piant the house and many other things I gould do at home. Some nights I would go to pictures or go out for a brink and some nights I would stay and watch teleivison all night. And when I have holidays I would go to a place for a day or two I gould go to London and many places I would go to. The job I would like doing Best is working at the docks. My Best hoodies are Swimming Rugby and gurmooing.  Words: 168
