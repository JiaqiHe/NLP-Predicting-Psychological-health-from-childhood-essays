I am now 25 and am working in a sweet shop or news agents. It is a busy life but I enjoy it. I do play football now and then but I am nearly always in the shop. My wife and I and our six children all live in a big flat. When we go on holiday we pack our things and usualy we go to Cornwall or Devon and sometimes to Longleat. Once when I was young I used to enjoy playing rounders and football with the whole of the class.
Three of our children go to [school name] Primary school where I was and they seem to be getting on very well. They leave that school when they are twelve. Sometimes in my spare time I do some balsa would models with my eldest son Philip who is very good at it. Sometimes when I go past book shops I usualy go in and by some for myself. When it is raining I usualy sit down and read one of my books. Sometimes I draw animals, birds, faces, or costume. The fashion has changed since when I was a boy and some people wear dresses down to the floor stretching for about two feet. The intresting things that I like doing are models, stamps, football acasionally, drawing and art.  Words: 220
