My name is [male name] [surname] and the work I am doing at 25 years old is I run a petrol station just outside of Bristol it is a good job. But I do'nt just do that I play for Bristol Rovers F.C. so I have to do training nearly every day. I play at Inside Right I rarely have time to go home I usually finish at 10 o'clock. The only whole day I get off is Sunday and sometimes on a Saturday if a match is postponed, when I am at home I just have a rest or go out with my wife who is 23 years old we have been married for one year my wife works at a supermarket. In a few weeks time I will be going for a tour in Spain with Bristol Rovers we are having a five match tour. I have got three other hobbies I like fishing, cricket, and golf I play that in any other spare time I have got. My wife and I have a holiday every year last year we went to Majorca this year we will be going to Cornwall. I have got one brother he is 37.  Words: 201
