My Carreer.
The life I am leading is a good one, because I play for Manchester United and that I have always wanted to do. It is one of my greatest interest in life, for you meet plenty of nice people as well as playing football. 
You also get very good pay.
If I couldn't be a proffesional footballer, I would probably try and get a job like a solicitor or somethig simalar to that. 
At night I get a number 9 bus to [street name]. Where my wife and three children come to the front door and greet me. My wife name is [female name] and my three sons names are [male name], [male name] and [male name]. [male name] iss the eldest he is 11, [male name] is the youngest he is 7 and [male name] is 9.
Every morning we get up about 8.30 am. We then have breakfast and the ready for school and I get ready to go to Old Trafford for that is Manchester Uniteds ground. My does not go to work, because she has to clean the house. All three of the children go to school but none have school diners. So really I lead a very interesting and pleasant life.  Words: 205
