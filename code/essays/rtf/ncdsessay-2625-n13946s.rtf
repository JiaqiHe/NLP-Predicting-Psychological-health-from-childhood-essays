My job is a groom and I live in [town] at wales. It is very peaceful and I sometimes like swimming in the river their. I am very interested in animals and especially horses. I did want ot be a hairdresser but I changed my mind, and style. the familys instead I am not married but engaged. I like my job very much. Early in the morning I get up and see to the chickens, then groom the ponies and till breakfast exercise them on the samllish moor near the paddock. I like treking as I like traveling.
      That is* another thing. I have traveled to America and stayed for 8 months. then to Austrailia but my home town is [town], which I visit 4 times a month. I like the crooked lanes and the houses and cottages which are dropped down in any space possible. Each year it has a lovely Gymkhana and I enter for it every year with my piebald stallion. Once I won a red rosette. OH I quite forgot I am getting marrried on thursday which is two days away I have a gorgeous white lace dress with 12 lace underskirts to make it stand out. Well, I was born in [town] We have dog which we had the day I was born, and we still have her and she is very old now. We have gold fish and many tame birds. When I'm older I will get a home for old and sick horses Etc.  Words: 251
