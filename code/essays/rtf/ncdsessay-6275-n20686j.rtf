I am 25 and I work in a shop it seems very intresting. I work 2 hours a day we have lunch brake at 12oclock we have our dinner in the shop at the back a and we shut the shop for dinner. And I am married and my mother works as well as I do and my husband works as well but he works at a shipyard in the town. At home I come home from work and I do the meals and I clean up as well when I get home my husband helps me to tide up so if eney body comes to vist us and the house wont be un tidy. My intreest is that when you work in a shop you have so many People come in and buy your things at the shop that you see a lot of the people who come and by your things. My mother workes in a post office and she thinks that it is intressting as well as I do my father works in the telephone exchange he has been working their for 10 years and he will soon be retiring and but my mother will still go on working.
