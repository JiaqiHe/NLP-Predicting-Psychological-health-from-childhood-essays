I am aboard the Hms Marcailey serving 12 years as a sailor. I am not yet married and I live with my mother and father in a small cottage Wales. The view from the cottage is beautiful. and I'm sorry I have to mis it being away at sea. But in the small village [village] everybody knows everybody and it's not a case of having to make friends again like it is some big citys. A board the ship it is not so bad as I imagined, every body is friendly and routine is not so strict, and its gorgeous to see the waves ripple and sparckle and if ones lucky you can see brightly coulered fish against the royal blue backgrond.
