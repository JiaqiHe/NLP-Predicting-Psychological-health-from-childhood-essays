I am now 25 years old and I am leading a good life. I have many interests one is to do electronics. what I do is to fix plugs and once I even mended the television. Sometimes I do odd jobs for neighbours like washing windows and fixing taperecorders. Another interest is photography I go around taking pictures and sometimes I enter competitions on photgraphy. Stamp collecting is one of my best interests I hope one day I will have a penny black. My work us a painter this consists of me going around painting walls and even back grounds ato films. I have a boss he is very nice because he is my father. he sends me on good jobs like inside jobs and not very often outside one's because it sometimes gets very cold my pay is xxxx15 per week. I have an uncle his job is plumbing and heating I go with him sometimes, to help him he is jolly nice for once he let me come to Austria to learn to ski.  Words: 176
