When I am 25 years of age I would like A Job as a nurse or dancing teacher. I would all so like to live in a bunglo in the country with a husband and children and may be a pet bird or dog. I would not smock but if my husband did, I would not mind. I would all so like a big garden at the back of the bunglo. I like looking after children so in my spare time I would do so. I would clean the houes through once a week. but I would hover and dust when ever it needed it. 
I would put clean sheets and pillow cases on the bed once a week also.
I would try to keep the garden looking tidy and ful of colour. 
I would also work hard on my Jobs, and save some money in the Bank. in the sumer I would not go on holiday becaues I think there are lots of other nice ways to spend a hoilday. one of the things I would like to buy is a washing machine becaues I would - like to do the washing my self if I got time. I would also like a mixer it would come in very handy with cooking
I like going sometimes for long walkes and rides. I would take my children to the park evrey so often. At night time I would try and make sure they went to bed at the right time. becaues it is inportant for there heath that they get there Sleep.  Words: 260
