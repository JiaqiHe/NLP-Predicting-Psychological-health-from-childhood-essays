I am living in a large, quite expensive, house in the suberbs of middlesex. My house taies a park of considerable size. I am leading a prosperous life, enjoying my self. I am interested in large cars and picturesque countryside. My home life is expensive but to my taste and sometimes, because of budgets, hectic. I work in the electrical part of a famous firm. In my spare time I experiment with chemicals and gases and also take part in varios stage performouses (orchestra, not acting). In These I play the piano and the cello.
My House is laden* with comfortable furniture and most modern amenaties. I have a spacious garen to back on to, which is carefully planned to have two small lawns at the house and on one level, a large town on the next level, and an orchard at the back, these are dressed with flowers, greenhouses and three garages  Words: 152
