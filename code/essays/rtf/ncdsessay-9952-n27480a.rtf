I am 25 now and I've got a lovely comfortable home. I go to work every day. I work in C*A.S at oxford street. I cook some bacon and leave it on the gas stove for my huband who gets up at half past seven. I say good by and catch a strain. When I get to the shop I go to the . childrens clothes departmetn. I hand my coat up and go to the cash desk were I take the money. Sometimes I have trouble with some people but I soon sort it out with the manger. At dinner I collect my things and go down to a restarant. I have for the firsts fish and chips and for afters I have ice cream. After my days work I go home and get the tea ready. My husband gets some of the shopping at De*en. He works at the bank of England. On Sunday I go to the laundret and do the washing. I do most of the work on Sundays and when I have days off.
I do hope I can get a job at loughton in the afternoon*. So that I won't have to work hard on Sundays. 
At hom in the afternoons I watch televison. Sometimes I go to a club with my husband and we have drinks and dance to pop music. We also like going to watch films at the cinermar. When I have time of carse. We have no children but we do want some. My husband used to work in the navy and I used to be lonely. But now we sit together and have fun. Sometimes we go to partys and talk to lots of people.  Words: 285
