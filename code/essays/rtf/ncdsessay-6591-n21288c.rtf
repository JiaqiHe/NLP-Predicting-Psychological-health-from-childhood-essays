My name is Joanna and I am twenty-five years old. I am marrade to a very nice man, he stands five foot ten inches and weighs ten and a half stone. I also have to children, a boy and a girl, [male name] is four years old and [female name] is two years years old.
When I was younger I was very keen on diving but I am to busy to carry on. But twice a week I coach diving at Crystal Palice, providing my husband is home to look after the children, other wise I take [female name] and [male name] with me, and at the end when I have finished coaching. I take the children into the swallow pool which is three feet so I have to hold [female name]. The diving pool is seventeen feet deep.
My husband takes me out once a week for dinner and my sister minds the children for me. The whole family loves animals so we have three* dogs two cats and a little pony for the children. We have a padock at the bottom of the garden to keep the pony in.  Words: 189
