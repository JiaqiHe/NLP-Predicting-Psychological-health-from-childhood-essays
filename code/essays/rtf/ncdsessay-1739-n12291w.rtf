I emagrated* to Astrala* last year. I have have a small farm* just outside Sidney. I have 250 acres* of land and on that I *****ly plow and ceep animals on. I go into Town (Sidney) about twice a week mostly to get ca*** and hay, my wife does all the Shopping. So I don't have to worey about that. We have two girls one is twelv and the other is ten. [female name] the oldest has just got to the stage of pop and Horse rideing, [female name] the unger one has just finished her first play with the school and she came in yesterday saying that* the c***** teacher* said that she was the best of all we have just got over the worst summer* for years. The sun was so hort - that it dride* up all the ***nds and all the crop*. 500 sheep and 100 cows died* with lack of water and we almost dried up as well. But we seem to have* got over that and we are all back to normal a gane. The two Children went back to school after the summer* holladays three weeks a go. The road* is* very dust and one of [female name]s* frends was injerd with a doged* up thought* from the dust. I miss the football a lot but U have plenty of cricket*.
