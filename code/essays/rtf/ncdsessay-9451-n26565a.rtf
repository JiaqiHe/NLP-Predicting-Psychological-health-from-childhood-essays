"Twenty-Five years old.

I am a vet, my name is Mrs Evans and I am going to look at a horses' foot because he injured it on a reel of barb wire.
I pulled up in my red mini outside, ""Andred Race Horse Stables,"" and got out to inspect the horse, I found that the pastern was broken, and I told the owner that He could never race again.
When the owner heard this he was heartbroken for he said that he had had hopes that he could enter him in for the ""Grand National."" He told me that as he could never do anything with him, would I put him down.
I was horrified at this suggestion to put such a fine animal down. I told him that I would keep him, (What would my husband say).
After months of training I could ride him, at last I entered him in for the ""Royal Windsor Horse Show,"" Floribunda won first prize for all my hard and treasured work."  Words: 164
