----------------------
I start the day by having breakfast which mainly consists of two boiled eggs, a roll and a cup of tea. Then I rush to the stables and start mucking out , its a messy job but you have to be used to it , to take the job of Riding Instructress.
Soon its six o` clock and all the other sleepy heads come to help me , but they're usually to late for I have it all done but never mind they can feed the horses and exercise then. I lead a happy and contented life with the horses and as you can see my main interest is riding m others are visiting and looking after my other pets : A rabbit , fish , guinea pig and a cat.
I'm engaged and will be married next month , we're going to the French Riviera and Italy for our honeymoon , then maybe we`ll settle down in Canada in (place) , and we'll live in a log cabin on a farm and breed horses .
