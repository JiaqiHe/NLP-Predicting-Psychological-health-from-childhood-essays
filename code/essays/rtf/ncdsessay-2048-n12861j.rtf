My name is (name) and I am twenty five. I am married and have two chil-dren. My job is a secretary in an insurance company. One of my interests is looking after pets in my spare time. I like dogs and horses especially, and cats. Also I like to go abroad once a year.
At home I cook, wash and clean the house and in the after noon I go to work. My holiday last year took me to Holland where I spent two weeks touring the tulips fields and canals.
My job is at a large insurance company, (company). My manager is a (name) and I earn seven pounds ten a week, that is from Monday to Friday. My work is to copy out bills and policies. In the office there's a machine that photogaph's letter's and does an exact copy of them. My home life is a happy one except when my husband and I have a row and when my grand-father comes down to stay. My grand father  is a very mean person and he tries to tell me how to run my family and one day I'md afraid I lost my temper and turned him out. My children's names are (name) and (name) they both stay to school dinner's at (school). Next week they will leave both are going to (place) and I am going to be very happy if they get on well. The (school) has done a great job in educateing me and my children. I hope that I can leave my office job soon as I would sooner work at a kennel as I like dogs. I love working with dogs. Well this is what I hope to be in the future, but I may change my mind before then.  Words: 295
