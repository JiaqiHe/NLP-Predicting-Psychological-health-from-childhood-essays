I'm still single and living at home with my mother and father. I have gat a job as a postman. whne I was 16 I left school and went to university at the age of twenty I left university and got a job as a pastman. One of my interests is football I go every we to see **** play and sometimes travel away to *aker the places* like Manchester. My home has changed a lot we have got open stairs now and got different wallpaper on the walls and got more tropical fish than we had. In our baby where we had two cloons* we only got one now and we got sliding doors. On my job ya*s have to be up early at 5-o oclock and be at the past office by six and sort all the mail out parcel. There is three deliverys a day one at 8-o oclock 12 oclock 4.30. The life I am leadin is hard because we have'nt got much money we are hoping for our premium bond numbers to come out.  Words: 179
