My name is mr [name] I live at [address] I play for a team (football team) called [football club] I am also in the England football team my ambition is to become captain and win the world cup I do not have to play for England I can play for Irelamd because I am Irish desscent that means I have Irish blood or Irish parents but I was born in England but Englands football team were and still are doing exeptionally well but Ireland still arent doing very well and anyway when I was 11 years old I captained Ireland we won 5-4 I scored 2 goals but when your a proffesonal youir considered very lucky you might even score 6 goals but about 1 player scores this amount every 2 years maybe if a learns lucky 1 year this is very doubtful because most of the players in the clubs haven't got the skill.

I like doing experiments with all the equipment but I give money to my parents and 16 pounds to my rent and everything and so I have to use very little money for This but I do the best I can with the equipment I can get but it is usually second hand equipment but still it is equipment and who knows I might make a big discovery with little equipment.
