I get up at 6 a.m every morning including Sundays. The I go to the riding stables where I work. The first thing I do when I get there is to visit my horse - stallion Blizzard, who is very light grey & is 16.2 hands high. Then I go to [name] the head groom who tells me what horses to groom, feed, and exercise & muck out each horse.
Normally I would start with Blizzard. I put his feed into his manger, first. His feed consists of oats, bran (dampend), hay & a few other things as well. While he eats I groom him. When I've finished this I tie him up outside the Stable and muck it out. This takes about quarter-of-an-hour. When I've finished I exercise him for about an hour. Then I go on to the other horses. The other horses I do usually include Playboy, Madamoiselle & Jester. 
By this time it is 2 o'clock and I have half-an hour for lunch. When I have finished I take any horses needing shoeing to the blacksmith or I might teach some children how to ride. I might even be helping to break in a young horse.
My day ends at 5 O'clock, when I rush home with [name] my flat-mate, and we tidy up our flat. 
When this done we rush back to the stables to have a decent ride. [name]'s horse is called Lancer.
I get xxxx25 a week pluss tips from grateful parents. I am saving up for my own riding stables & hope to have them before I'm 30 yrs. old. This is a normal day but sometimes, something out of the ordinary happens.  Words: 278
