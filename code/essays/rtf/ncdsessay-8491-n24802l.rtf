I am now 25 years of age. I have just left teacher's training college. Now my aim in life is to go to South America in the Amazon Jungles and help the natives there to lead a better life. When I retire and saved enough money from somewhere, I am going to by a little thatched cottage high up on a hill in Wales and have a cow, 5 ewes and a ram a dog, a cat, and a big oak tree. The house is going to be tudor stlye with old timer beams and round stained glass windows. The house is going to be called Animals Haven and have a trickling stream going down to the valley below. I do not wish to get married but I might fall in love once or twice but never get married.  Words: 139
