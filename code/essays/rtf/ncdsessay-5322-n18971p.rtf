My life would be very easy because I would play foot ball for a very good team in the first Division. I would play left wing or right wing, and if I want to go and play for another team or club they would have to pay in thousands of pounds and transfer me to one of there football payers and then I would be in there team or club, but when there is not no football I would try and get a job, like loding the crates aboard ships at the barbour or giving out pools house to house. and a lot of other jobs near were I live, and at the end of the football season I would get a lot of money for my family and me. Football is one of Britons leading game and I will enjoy every game that I play for my country, I get chucked into the reserves I will try to get back into the main team. When I am married I will have three or four children and I will teach them to become profesional footballers like I will be when I am 25 years old.  Words: 195
