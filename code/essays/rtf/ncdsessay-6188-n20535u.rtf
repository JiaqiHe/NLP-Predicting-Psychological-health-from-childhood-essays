Every Thursday night I practice football for a local team I play for. we have matches on Sunday aftenoon because it is a special leauge. I Somtimes have to go to [city] to see a firm called [company] because i might have a job there when I am 27. I have a good deal of gardening to do as we have a very large garden. We grow vegatables and all sorts of flowers. I am very interested in table tennis, I go to a large building were you can play for a long time and you can get coached if you want to. My dad use to work at a place called [company] but now he works at [company]. When I go to work I take sandwhiches and eat them there. You have to do a lot of typwriting and a lot of moving around. Underneath the office is a fire station. We often dash to the window when we hear the alarm. I work with a mate called [name] he lives near me in a bungalow, he goes to table tennis with me sometimes, from my bedroom I can see his garden.
In my spare time I make tracktion engines. I am very interested in Railway engines and I have got a very big Railway layout. Whenever a new train is on sale in the shops I usually buy it. For our holiday this year we are going to Scotland. Last year we went to America.  Words: 276
