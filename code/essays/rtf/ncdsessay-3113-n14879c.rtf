----------------------
I am 25 years old. I am working as a typist in London. I work for a large firm. The working hours are 10am to 5pm I very much like animals, especially cats. at work I work weekdays but not weekends. I am earning enough money to pay rent, electricity and all of the other payments. at home on the weekends I go shopping Saturday and on Sunday I sit down and relax. My sister (name) is 17 she comes and stays with me sometimes. When I come back from shopping on Saturday I make a cup of tea and relax. a few Sundays I go out in the garden and plant seeds and prune rose bushes. It is mostly Sundays when i visit my parents and brothers and sisters. if I already have bought my shopping I go Ice-skating when I am of from work for a couple of weeks I take a ride down to the country. I like to see the ***** in a ******* while their mothers are just ****** in the **** *****. The horses look ***** with their heads popping through a hole in a hedge. although the life in the country is nice I am always glad to get back to home. Noisey streets are **** that quiet country roads. On work mornings I get up at seven to catch the next train to London. In the evenings I look forward to a warm bed.  Words: 242
