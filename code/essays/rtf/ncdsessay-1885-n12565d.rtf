I live out in the country in a small bungalow. There is very little house work as I live by myself. It is usually washing up or cleaning. I give the house a good clean every month The curtains are blue so are the carpets. I have tiles in the bathroom and kitchen. It is all easy going and my friends drop by nearly every day. I own two horse. One is a grey mare with blue eyes and is called Snow Queen. The other is a black stallion called Demon. They are very good polo ponies, and Demon is a good show jumper I have won several prizes and cups I work at the stables a little way down the road. Mrs [name] runs the stables and is a cheery little person who can do anything with a horse. I mostly train the younger ponies It is very enjoyable. I live in a small village called [village] in Yorkshire. I am also interested in collecting stamp and postcards. I have a boy friend called [name] who also works at the stables. At Christmas we have a big party and every body is invited. The horses have a small bit of Christmas cake each. One day part of the roof fell in and the big bedroom was a right mess I had to get the builders in and also the decorators. Another time the water would not come and I had to do without water for two days. Several of my friends own shops in the village and I often get things free. My life is very interesting and I hope it will stay that way.  Words: 276
