Last year I ran into Two of my old shums [name] and [name]. I invited them to stay wiith us for awile with the familys the exsepted the ofer. One day I desided to play a little trick on them + when the went to have there usual morning swim I would put a plastic shark in the pool so that the would think it was a real one and not swim I did this but as [name] dived in the waves noched it on the side and smashed it. That day was the last day they were going to stay because they had to go to a weding in London.  Words: 238
