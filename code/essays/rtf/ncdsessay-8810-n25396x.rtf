I am now 25 years old. I am not married but engaged. I work in a bank as a secretery with some other girls of about the same age as myself. I still live with my mother and Father. The bank I work in is in Bristol so I drive my car to work. I get up to go to work at half past 6 and I reach there at half past 8. In my spare time I like painting and walking but most of the time I have to help my mother with the housework. I like watching teleivison alot. The bank I work in is quite big. On Saturdays I have a part time job in a Hotal where I have to clean and polish, then I go to work at 1 o'clock to half past 3. If I get the time I go horse riding but thats not very often. Sometimes I go to my sisters for an afternoon. When ever I get a day off work I like going shopping on my own. Another pastime of mine is playing records. I also like reading books.  Words: 189
