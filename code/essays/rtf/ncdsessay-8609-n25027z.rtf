I am now twenty fife and I am working in a school. As a teacher at Secendry school teaching in a girls school. They have maths every morning and after that English. Sometimes I give them a Composion to do then they have french. At playtime I go into the staffroom with all the other teachers and have a cup of tea and then talk. After dinner I sometimes go to the shops to do some shopping. Then I come back and do history about Queen Elizabeth I till it is playtime the children are always asking if they can do a job. At singing usually some girls dont behafe. So they get into trouble. Then some students come and I sit at the back of the class on a chair watching to see who puts their hand up. At home time I go home in a bus. On tuesday someone in my class brought a tortiose to school everyone looked at it. They have games on a Friday netball on the grass.  Words: 173
