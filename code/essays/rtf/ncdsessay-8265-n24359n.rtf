I have a gardening job and in my spare time I make large Plastic kits. I sometimes drink but I dont smoke.
I have a dog called Policeman Plod. I also have three cats kitty mew and choo choo chatinougat a monkey called Sam and a turkey called Chester.
One day I took P.C Plod to Queens park for a run around, suddenly he saw a rabbitt he darted off and I ran after him calling him back he came running back with the rabbitt unharmed in his mouth. After he had gone to the park I found Chester had come to the door to greet me. when I went into the kitchen I found kitty and Mew on the boiler fast asleep. Sam kindly took my hat off but tried to eat it I eventually got him back 
When I went to work the next morning the manager was Ill and to my amazment I was sent* to take over. well I told the others what to do and one of them said Why* should I do what you say? I told him* **** had happened and he said* no* more* about* it when I got home I was completely* fagged out but thank goodness* the* pets were helpful.  Words: 208
