I am now 25 years old it is 1983. I have been in the R.A .F. for 3 years now. I am a flight lea*tenant . I fly in one of the fastest planes in the world , a Saab 123 . The RAF is much smaller now than it was 15 years ago , because it is impossible to have fights between planes because they fly too fast. My plane flies at 3,000 miles per hour and up to 30 miles high. Planes are mostly used for taking pictures of the country beneath from the air . If there was a war planes would not be used for the defence of the country, anti - aircraft missiles would do that , but for bombing raids , I like being in the R.A. F. because the work is exciting and , although my base is in Scotland I have to land at R. A. F . stations to refuele , and sometimes I have to stay there for a few days . The work is not as dangerous as some people think , even if for some reason my plane was going to crash I have an ejector seat and would be quiet safe . The pay is good and we are treated very well . I would be quiet satisfied to stay in the R. A . F for the rest of my life .  Words: 236
