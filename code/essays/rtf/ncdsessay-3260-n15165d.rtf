I go to work at a hospital I am a nurse. I work at nights. So I spend most of the day at home. I do my housework in the morning So that in the afternoon I should have some time off. In the afternoon I take my children down the park, and I play about with them. I also take my dog for a walk as well. After that I go and take my dog home. And then take the children to thier grans. Then I say to myself I'll take my washing to the launderrette and have a good old chat with my friends. So I go back home and get my washing and my powder and take it to the launderrette. I meet my friends and have a chat with them. I go home andmake my tea and eat it, then I go upstairs and get changed. I write a note for my husband to tell him to get the children from their grans. Then I go to work.  Words: 172
