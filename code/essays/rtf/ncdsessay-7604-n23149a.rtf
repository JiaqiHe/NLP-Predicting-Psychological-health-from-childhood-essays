I would be a Electronic Engineer working till about half past six every day. In the evnings I would be makeing things for the house. In the weekend sometimes I would go out to the country and in the morning I would go shoping with my wife. On Sunday I would go to church. I would hope to have some children, sometimes I would go fishing with the children and spend some of my time working I would like to have well edjucted children.  Words: 84
