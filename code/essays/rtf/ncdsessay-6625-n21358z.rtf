My work is being an actress. In the morning I have to get up at 5.30, by 7 o'clock I have got my make-up on, a wig if I need it for the part I am going to play and the clothes the producer wants me to wear. Then I am ready to start reheasing At 10.30 am I have a cup of coffee and a couple of sandwichs At nights I finsh about 11.30 I am in bed for 11.45 I am asleep for 12.00 After about a month of reheasing I am then ready for filming which we have to run over a lot of times until the producer and director* is satisfied. After this I am given a bit of time of my own until another producer and director come along and wants me to make a film or a play.
I am married to a famous actor and we try our best to star in a film together but find it differcult because he likes westerns and I like light comedys
We prefer to live in a small house instead of a big mansion that some film stars have.  Words: 191
