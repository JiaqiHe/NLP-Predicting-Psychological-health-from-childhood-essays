I work in the offices at the National Provincial Building. I am very interested in stamp collecting, gliding, animals and fashion. At home I have two pets, a hamster and a rabbit. I am married. I have one little girl. The hamster is really hers and the rabbit is everybody's. I lead a very full life. Every day my mother looks after my little girl for me and I go to work. I want to leave work soon because of my little girl. My job is very nice and I am very happy there. I'm sorry to leave it.  Words: 99
