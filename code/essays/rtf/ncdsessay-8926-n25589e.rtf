Today is my 25th birthday and I am going to have a good feast tonight. In want to be a farmer on the farm at [hamlet] were I live. I live in a very large house indeed. When I go to work I will do rolling, ploughing baling, picking up the bales and other tractor driving work. I hope I will be able to get a little farm of my very own which I don't think will come true. I like the house I am living there is plenty of space for vegtables and flower beds which look nice when all the flowers are blooming. In my spare time I weed the garden and hoe the vegtables. I like a big lawn. I think I will lead a good life. If I can not be a farmer I will be a gardener or work round the house of flowers were there are loads and loads of different kinds of flowes. The flowers I like best of all is the coloured leaf. It has all different kinds of colours on its leafs. I will get a few ferrets and do some ferreting. My dad has got two which I do not like But I will soon get uset to them. They are white with pinks eyes. And if I do go ferreting I will have to get a good pair of gloves my dads ferrets scratch at them a they tear. I have a get many years to live yet at least I think so.  Words: 254
