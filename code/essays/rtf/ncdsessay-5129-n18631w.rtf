When I'm twenty five, I would like to be a nursemaid. Not nurse in a big house,but just an ordinary house just right. I'd buy the children their clothes, if they were good I'd take them to the cinema. If they (lived in (place),) and they lived near (place) I'd take them there on the (place) and other sight seeing places. We'd go shopping regularly. The children could spend their pocketmoney on what they liked. If I were to choose I would give them a shilling each. When my day off came I would buy some new clothes and shoes (if I needed some) On Monday i'd take the children to school (If they had to) Then when I came back I'd make the childrens beds then tidy their bedrooms. If one of them was ill I'd take their temperature of course when your training to be a Nanny you also have to learnfirst aid. So luckily I knew what to do.
I'd save up some money to buy a car. Because if I went on a bus it would be a fourtane going on the bus all the time. The car would be a gold capri. When the children came home they could have their pocket money.  Words: 207
