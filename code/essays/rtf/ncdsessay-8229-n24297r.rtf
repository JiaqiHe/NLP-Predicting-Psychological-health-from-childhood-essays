I am working in a shop, selling shoes, the best bit about selling shoes is puting them on peoples feet. I like showing the people the shoes that they might like, thats if they asked for the pair I showed them and when my days work is over Ill be glad to have a long rest. I am married and have got two children they both go to school but they have got to stay to school dinners. When I have a day off I tiding the house and make the beds and put the dinner on when I have got a day my children come home to dinner. I do the shopping. I wait* until the children come home they have their dinner when they had their dinner I wash up and wait until my husband comes home.  Words: 139
