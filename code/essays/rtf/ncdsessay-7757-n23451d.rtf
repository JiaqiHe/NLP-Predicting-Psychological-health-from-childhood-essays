When I am 25
When I am 25 I hope to lead a footballers life playing football for any team and in my spare time I might read books or make something out of spare wood I might just sit back in an chair and go to sleep. I might be intrested in swimming, I like swimming. I like going for walks, and when we had our easter holidays I went a walk nearly every day with my dad and to play football you need exercise. If I play football it might not *e played so I could get another job to suit the day that I might be playing. When I play football I hope to play at (place), the team I would like to play for is (team). If I *id not play for (team) any other team would do. If I played for (team) I would hope to beat (team) if (team) played them. What ever team I play for I hope that team got many cups and awards and I hope that I will get awarded with a medal. The po*tion I would like to play at is right back.  Words: 193
