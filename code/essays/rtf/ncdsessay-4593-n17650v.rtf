I woke up in the morning with the sun streaming through the bedroom window of my country small clean cottage in the hills of ****. I climbed out of bed and had my early morning swim in the river nearby. My friend who was sharing the cottage with me was cooking thee breakfast as it was her turn. At about nine in the morning we both cycled down to the viliage to help in the florist's shop. We did it in the morning because all the people came doen to sell their home grown crops and we could go out and arrange sinking slowly down behind the hills. When I put the goat in the shed for the night I found its shed in a terrible mess. There would be a spot of cleaning up to do it the morning. As I lye lie in bed reading by the light of my torch I thought about the next day. May be a spot of apple picking, maybe not. I never know what will happen for my life is full of surprises and I prefer it that way.  Words: 187
