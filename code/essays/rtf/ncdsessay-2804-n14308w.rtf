I have made my own laboratry and have discovered many things, first I discoverd a kind of liquid, that if you mix it with grain and give it to a cock the cock will lay eggs with two yolks. I have a garage aswell and in it i deghin things and then make them.
In winters i go to work in my car aswell as in summer.
And when i travel far places i travel in my helicopter.  Words: 76
