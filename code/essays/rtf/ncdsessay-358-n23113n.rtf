I not married but I have a definet boyfriend. I love going to parties and to have lots of fun. They call my boyfriend Richard [lastname] and he is twenty six. I have a small sister of nine and her name is Jayna. My friend Karen [lastname] and her boyfriend John go around with us to dance Halls etc. The other night Karen acedently got Baby-cham down her new dress by the Hostess of the party. Karen was furiuss and felt pouring one down hers. Last Saturday I went to buy a new Bell Bottom Suit but they didn't have one to my liking so I bought a black velvet dress with white frills. My ambition is to shake hands with the Queen and to meet the Prisdent of the U.S.A.  Words: 131
