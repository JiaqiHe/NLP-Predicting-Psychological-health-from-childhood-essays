I am now married and have one child aged 5. My husband is a miner and works mostly on nights My child gets me up every morning at 8 o.clock for to get her ready. for school. When I get up I make her a little breakfast. Then I dress her and give her her bus-fare and dinner money. I ride down on the bus with her, and I have to walk it home. Next its my job to get the dinner ready for my and my husband, this takes about quarter of an hour. When we have eaten up my husband goes back to bed. I side the pots away and wash them up I have a sit down in the chair and inten minutes time I am up again hoovering. When all thats finished I turn on the television and see whats on, if its somthing I don't like I turn it off again. Next its my job to wash the clothes this would take about half an hour. After this I would go down to the school and collect my child. When we got home I would make her tea and have mine with her. Again I would side the pots and wash them. The rest of the day I should sit down and watch television with my daughter At nine o clock we'd climb the stairs to bed.
(In my spare time I should go to the pictures or out dancing or try to find a job.) Next morning the same proceedure would happen. only my husband would be on day work.  Words: 265
