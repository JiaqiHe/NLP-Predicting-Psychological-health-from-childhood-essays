At my home I have a horse and several birds I also have a few hens. I am a veterinary surgeon, that is I treat all animals that are not well. I like horse riding and horses. I like all sorts of animals and I would like to have a lot of animals. I keep a lot of books because I enjoy reading. In my spare time I like to draw pictures. At home I like to do a lot of cooking. I would like to tour around Australia when I am a little older and then travel to Kenya, Central Africa and stay there for a few years. I live in a house wiht my brother in the country. We have a little farm next to the house where my brothers looks after the business of the farm. I travel to my work every day in my car. At my work I would help all animals that came in that would need attention such as if a dog had caught its leg in a snare I would have to put a bandage on its leg.  Words: 186
