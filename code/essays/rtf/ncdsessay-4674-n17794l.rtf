I am now 25 years old . I lead a happy life, and we have a nice cosy home . I still work as a nurse at the nursery. We have our own home in the village where we have always lived, (place), In the house there is not a lot to do, as we have only two bedrooms, one spare. Our kitchen is fairly big but the living-room rather small. I do most of the cooking at home, and we rarely go out. I find my work just suits me as I like children and do not like being in the house all day. We have a dog. I always liked animals but have only had one pet. I have no particular hobbies and usually just read a book or watch television or listen to the radio as there is nothing to do. On the whole you could say that life is just fine.  Words: 155
