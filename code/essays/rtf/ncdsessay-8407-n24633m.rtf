----------------------
I hope to be a policeman at the age of 25, and I hope to lead a good life. So that my children (if I get married and have children) can take a good examble from me, so they can get a good job, and be polilite. I hope to play for the police's football team, and play cricket for a small team on Sundays, in the Summer. I hope my home life will be a pleasant one. If I get married I will get married at church.
