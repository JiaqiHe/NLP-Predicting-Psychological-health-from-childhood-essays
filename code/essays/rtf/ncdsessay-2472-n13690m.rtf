I am an Artist. I have a child of one. I draw country sceens and things like that. I am interested in Stamp collecting and I keep a horse. My child is a girl. My husband is an Artist too but he works on Scraper bord. This a peice of white bord with black paint on it. We have a home in the country. It is a small house by a river. The river is not ours. Our nearest neighbour is a mile away. we have a nice Sceen to draw and lots of Space to ride in. Our car is a black Ford. we have a Small back garden and no Front one. The nearest town is one and a half miles away. There is a wood quite near us. In our house there is no upstairs. we hardly ever get any letters or anything like that. we have a dog who is two years old. we have to go to the village quite often because we have to get food for our pets as well as our Selfes. we go twice a week on Saturdays and Wednesdays. Sometimes we get letters from people who want us to draw things apart from what we are doing. so we do two or may be three Jobs at a time. we hardly ever get time to go rideing. I think that one of thease days we will get fed up and Stop drawing and keep horses instead.  Words: 246
