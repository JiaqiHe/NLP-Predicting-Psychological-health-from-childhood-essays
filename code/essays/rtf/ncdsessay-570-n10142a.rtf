"""I am now married I have three children. But I do not see much of them because I am at the Police station at six o'clock in the morning. To nine at night. On Sundays I see the children because I am on night duty then. And so I work a whole day from Sunday nig-ht to monday night. My main pastime on sunday Is amusing the children. I have a boy six years old called [male name] and two girls aged three and five my wife is 22 years old. The sargent at the station is a hard man but we like him. We have an hour for lunch and no more. If we are back late the sarge wants to know why. My friend P.C. [surname] is always being shouted at. It is not my second year in the force. I have done two years of training. I like night duty better than day becase it means I can get away from sarge. He only works at day time. If sarge is in a mood I pity [surname]. I still dont see why he has to pick on [surname]. My wife wants me to pack it in but I say I am erning good money and I like it so why should I. In the canteen [surname] and Me have at bit of fun but if sarge should here us weve had it. The wife and I have got a little house in Norwich."  Words: 246
