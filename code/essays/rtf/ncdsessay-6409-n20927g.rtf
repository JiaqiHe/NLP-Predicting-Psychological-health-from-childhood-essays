"My name is ""[name]"" and I am twenty five years old I am at university studying to be a doctor. I am in my sixth and final year. Soon I hope to be at Manchester hospital, in charge of ward 5. I live with my mother and father in the home in which I grew up in. I have my own pony called Tipsy, she is a very good jumper. I go reguarly to the Baths when on my holidays. I am single and have no intentions of getting married until (to) around the age of thirty. I still go to my riding and singing lesson's on Wednesday's and Monday's. My brother who is a barrester also works in Manchester, he lives next door to my home. He is married and has two children, aboy and a girl. When I am on holiday I sometimes go and help our family doctor on his rounds. My pet is a siamese cat called Sheba. She is chocolate *oint with beautiful blue eyes. I have had her since I was 9 years old. When I start work I shall move into a small bungelow less than 50 yards from my parents home. I shall then have to do all my own house work helped by a cleaner coming three mornings a week."  Words: 219
