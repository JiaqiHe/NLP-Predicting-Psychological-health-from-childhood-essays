I am called Mister [name]. I have my own motor bike and I live in a council house but I have been saving up since I got my job and now I have almost enough money to buy my own house. I have been married two years now. My wife and I live alone, The area we live in is quite a nice one. I am a telephone engineer and I get fifteen pounds a week but when I am older I will get more. My mam and dad are still alive and my sister who is twenty two was married last year. I am a part time footballer for an ameatur team and I am centre half. I am going on holiday to Cornwall in two weeks time for a month. My wife is twenty three she was twenty one when we got married. We might be getting a farm instead of a house because my wife and I both like animals. We have an alsation called magor named after my dad's alsation, and a budgie. I am a member of the South [suburb] Club and I take my wife twice a week on Saturdays and Sundays. We have central heating and a gas-fire. Our living room is decorated with a three piece suite, a dining table and sideboard to match, a television, and a radiogram. My wife is a secretary and she gets quite a lot of money.  Words: 240
