The job is very good, I like traveling alot. I like the job because you can travel alot all around the world. I never hardely get home to see my mother or my father. because I'm alWays on the move. When we stop at a place we always have time to make friends with people and get to know them. Sometimes we even learn some of their language.
We never get bored because there is so much to do and you just keep working and working so that you can't get bored.
Plus the money for the pay you also get tips off the passengers. Through most of the day you are in the aeroplane flying.  Words: 114
