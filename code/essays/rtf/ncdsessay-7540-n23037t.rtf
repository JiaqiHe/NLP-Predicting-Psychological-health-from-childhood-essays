I am a school teacher, and I teach 3rd year junior primary school children. I am married, and I have two children, a girl and a boy. I enjoy teaching very much and my class is very co-operative. I have two dogs, called Tassie & Candy, and they are both West Highland Terriers. I play the piano and clarinet, and I enjoy it very much. I belong to most of the various clubs in our town, and we meet once a week. Also I go to pottery on a Wednesday at 6.0.0. p.m. 
      When I go to work, I get up at seven thirty, and have my breakfast My two children have just started the school where I teach so there is no problem about looking after them in the day time. I teach until 12.0.0. and then have my lunch with my two children. Then at 1.30pm I go back to my class and teach till four o'clock. Then I take my children home and we have a drink. After tea we take the two dogs for a long walk in the woods and when we get home I put the children to bed.
      Occaisonally I go and see old friends of mine that went to school with me, and I h**** how they are getting on. We live in a very pretty part of Wales and we often go for long drives into the hills. My husband is a keen photographer and he likes the scenery around us. 
      Nearby there is a farm that my two children, [name] & [name] often go to, where there are children of their own age. Altogether I lead a very happy life, and I would not swap it for anything.  Words: 290
