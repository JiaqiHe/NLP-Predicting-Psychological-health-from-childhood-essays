I am a teacher in a Junior school in Sussex. The children I teach are the 8-9 year olds. I am not married and I live all alone except for my two cats Candy and Tuft. The childern in my class are mainley good but one or two like to be naughty. I don't specialise in anything particular the genral subjects are maths, english, reading and natural sceince. I think natural sceince is my favorite it is also the childrens. Tomorrow I am taking the class to London to see the tower, they are eager to see the crown jewels. In the summer I go home to see my mother and father. I often on weekends get in my little red mini and drive out right into the country and wakl for miles picking flowers and generally enjoy the view last week Candy had four lovely kittens, when I told the class about this they decided they would like to do a project* on cats. They are allways wanting to find out as much as they can about different things now they are learning about London and its history. I am 5ft 6ins my faverite colours are blue and green. I don't think I will stop teaching until I have to. I have grown to enjoy this job very much.  Words: 220
