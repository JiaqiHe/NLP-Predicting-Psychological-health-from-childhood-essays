I hope to be a Spaceman at the age of 25 I will hope to exploe planets and find people of diffrent races in a space rocket of my own desin and for carrying extrey fuel for a retern joiny to earth. When I am about 50 I will retire and have a family of my own. We might live in a semi detached house and would still like to stude the stars. I will be lanched off at cape kennedy 2 to 3 millon gallons in three kind o f balls* at the side of the second stage I would use the fuel in the balls* and then 360 feet of fuel power from the engine which would take me in to an orbit around the plant I was to land on Then on landing find out what lives* on the planet and samples* and then take* them* back* to* earth*.
