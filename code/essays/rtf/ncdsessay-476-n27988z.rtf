I am single and live with my friend in a flat. My job is a teacher. The main subject that I teach is needlework. At night I go to night school and learn more needlework. My friend goes to pottery lessons. It is an interesting job being a teacher. I do not get much spare time though. At the weekend my friend and I go into the country and enjoy the scenery. My other hobby is stamp collecting I have got two thousand stamps. One of them is the Penny Black. I also like doing needlework. Some children in my needlework classes have produced some good work whereas others are slow and lag behind. It is a good subject to teach I think because as the children get older they can start making things for themselves. I am teaching my friend how to do some of the more complicated stitches I have made a dress for myself with some fancy stitching on. After night school I do some reading I borrow books from a public library. I also read in bed for a while. I have tried writing a book myself but it was unsuccessful because I could not think of an ending. It is a good job being a teacher and I like it. I hope to learn more subjects and teach them as successfully as I have done needlework.  Words: 231
