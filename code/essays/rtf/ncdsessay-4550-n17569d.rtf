I'm married and I have got two children I don't go out to work, I just do the house work. I do a lot of cooking and a lot of sewing, I have a lot of other things to do as well. My children do not go to school yet because they are too young, and they run about the house getting in my way I don't go out alot, but when I do I have to find some-one to look after the children  Words: 84
