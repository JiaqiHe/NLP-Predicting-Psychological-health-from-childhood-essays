I live at [village] near [town]. I am 25 years old. I work in a shop. It is a nice job. Sometimes on a night I go to the pictures. In the shop I sell cakes. It is a [name of shop] shop. The customers are usually very nice. I sell all kinds of cakes, mint meringues, cream buns, and many others. I live in a house with one of my friends. She is called [name]. We each have a bedroom and we share the cooking and cleaning. When I get a day off I go to visit my mam and dad. I always take them some of the cakes from the shop. I take my brother and sisters some sweets. On a Saturday night my friend and I usually go to a dance or a nightclub. When I get a day off and it is in the school holidays one of my sisters or my brother could come to stop with me for a day. If they did I would take them to see a picture or something like that. I would like to learn to ice sckate. I sometimes go to the rink at [town]. I like it very much. When I can scate properly I will try to teach my sisters and brother.  Words: 216
