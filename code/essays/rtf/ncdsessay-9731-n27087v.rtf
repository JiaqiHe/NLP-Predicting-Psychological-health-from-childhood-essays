The life I lead is a tough one. I like reading football book and going places. it is not very good at home and I dont earn much money. My mates and Myself often go to the cinima. clubs and somtimes Stay on at work for more money thats if we do more work. I'me up at 5 o clock every morning. and I drive about a lot it good to come home at night. I visit my mother 2 times a week and help her I carry coal up the stairs and chop wood and stock her fire up So She can keep warm and I go to bed about 12 o clock it a very hard life and if you leave jobs are scarce and hard to get I dont bet. it is a tough and boreing life when your 25 years old. I live in a flat in bow and Im'e often very boured at home and at work I dont go to the libairy I slay at home and read my own books Sometimes I have a few of my mates round four a drink and tea we might go in the bedroom and have a game of darts or we might go to the pub and have a few drinks and a game of dart or we might go to see football being played or we might have an early night and go to bed  Words: 240
