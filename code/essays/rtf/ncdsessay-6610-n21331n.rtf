Its great at the age of 25 rompsing round doing what you like, I'm a helicoptor piolot it great all the rough ****** fighting comondo courses rope climbing and all that. Mind you its an easy life when Im home on leave to see mom and dad I earn loads of money as a nechanic in the Royal Marines I, send most of it home to mom. My own intrests are collecting stamps and Foriegn cions I do tots of reading and writing. The best bit about being in the Marines is the comando co**rse it teaches you lots of things like how to put up a tent on your own in the dark. How to come down a rope on your guts. Banyout practice and how to defend your self if some one comes at you with a k**fe there fast or even a baynat and rifle they teatch you how stop them. I find it moste intresting, lets leave this and get bak to my home life it feels strange not to be in a nusy place full of smoke and smell its even more strange to get into a comfortable bed, cansidring the coniditon at the camp all lumpy hard and spiked with twigs you wish you were out in the bath garden inside a tent in a sleeping bag what I call a camfortable bed. Then when you wake up serial for breakfast. Then your **** to chapping wood for the fire but no need its electric you so wish you were back at camp with the lovley smell of the smoke fire. But it nat all camping a lot of it is staying in the barracks du*ng sports ****** and going on parac**** just great.  Words: 290
