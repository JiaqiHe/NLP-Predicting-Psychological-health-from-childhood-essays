When I am 25 years old, I shall probably be married and have a little baby of my own. I shall have trained for a job, and left it while I was being married, and having my baby. I shall not of gon back to work yet, and shall not till my child is old enough to go to school. At the moment should probably be doing the house work, either washing up, dusting, washing, or hoovering. I might be going to town to get the shopping, and perhaps a new dress for my little girl if I had a girl if if was a boy I would be getting a jumper and shorts. I would come back on a bus or I would have a car if I were rich. I would be living a busy life at the moment because I would have a baby to look after aswell as the house work. When my child starts school I sopose I would have a busy life too because when I grow up I would like to be a teacher. I would take my little girl or boy out a lot, and take photos of them and when I am old I would be able to look back at them and remember the happy times I had.  Words: 218
