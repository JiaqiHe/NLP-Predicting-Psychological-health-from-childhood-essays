My job is a sailor on a Battleship called H.M.S. Bird. I am a gunner operating one of the Lugle* 6 inch guns. Today we are going on a criu*ing trip to the Medatterean Sea. I like being a sailor because there is more fresh air than in towns and you can see places instead of just listining about then and seeing pictures of them. Our ship is the biggest battleship is in the navey. It is 1,500 ft long and 120ft in breadth. It has 3,000 men and weight 70,000 tons. It has 12 6 inch guns and radar, tornedoes a helicopter and 3 missiles. It is now of the coast of Italy, 20 mites from the Harbour at Naples. We have to clean the ship and scrub the decks for our arrival in Naples. There are other big ships there as well. There is the liberian oil tanker which weigh 65,000 **re. We are stopping there for 2 days. We saw Mount Vesuvias with smoke hellowing from the top*. In Naples people are digging (of)* up*repairs of jugs and ra* which were the parts of Pompeii which was buried in A.D. 79, by Mount Vesarius. Soon we were back on brard ship. Then* the captain gave orders for us to sail to England. I day after we arrived at Plymouth. Our ship can travel 50 knots at the fastest. We had 3 weeks leave.
