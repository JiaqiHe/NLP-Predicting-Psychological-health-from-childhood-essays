When I am twenty five I want to be a Nurse. I help people. I want to o come a seinor nurse who helps the doctor do operations. Every other Sunday I want to go home and see my family. When I am 28 a district nurse, because you have to work in a hospital for three to four years.
      I am going to get married a have two children so one is not lonely. They would stay to school dinners while I am away. My husband and I would go out about every month, while they were young I would have a baby sitter then when they were older they would be alright to stay alone. For a treat I would take them to the cinima, depending on the times I had to work. I would not have any children until I was a district nurse so I would not have to leave them so much.  
      I would make clothes for them and knit sweaters and cardigans. I would teach my children how to make dresses and skirts and blouses, and teach them to knit sweaters and cardigans and skirts.
      I will keep collecting stamps and make a bigger collection. I will teach them how to read and write in my spare time. Then I would explain how you do a sum if they found it difficult.  Words: 229
