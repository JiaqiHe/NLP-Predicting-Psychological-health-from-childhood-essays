I now get on shows just because I am a popula pianist its been 19 years Ive been playing the piano. I still live with mother although Im married. I have two children which to me Id give them anything they wanted. I earn £10,000 a month for singing on shows. I am happy with my wife. The thing I so hate is when I get made fun of my pals just because my name is [xxxxxxx][lastname]. I go to my mum and dad's house once a week and I do their grass with my hover mower. My dad has one I must say but theirs is 14 years old and it start and stops in 5 seconds every time. So I have quite a good time except for the actuall night I step on that stage and play one of my most favourite tunes on the piano. My home life is gardning.  Words: 153
