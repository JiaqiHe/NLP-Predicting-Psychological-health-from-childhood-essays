I am now married and have a child of 3. I am a student nurse and I like it very much . I havent much free time so my daughter stays with her gran . Shopping is a trouble because I have to go home first to see what I need but usually I ask my mother to do it . I want to build my whole career on nursing so I study hard. My classes are manly on the treating of fractures and things like that . Every few days that I have away from the hospital I spent doing housework and taking care of my child. But every now and then I go out on outings with the local company of guides . It is a full life training to be a nurse but when you know that you have saved someones life all you usually here is, well all that training was worth it . My main intrest at home is listening to the radio , watching television , and houswork. But I have got alot more . When the day comes that I am finished my training and have become a real nurse I will be glad.  Words: 201
