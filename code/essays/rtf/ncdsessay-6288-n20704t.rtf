When I am 25 years old I hope to be at a collage training to be a vet. to be a vet you have to have more training than a doctor. I am on the way to to collage of vetenary in London. At collage I see people heel horses then after the lecture. I will go into the library. And read boots on bioligy. Then I will go into the grounds collecting speicmens to look under the micro scope. At home I will feed my animals. Then I will read a hook an horeses, At weekends I will go camping in a wood collecting worms and botogranfs*. of birds at the age of twenty five I hope to be a folly trained vet. When I have got enough money I will open a vets. And I will get more money than somebody ver*y* clever traing* to be a teacher. I should get a bout 5,000 more per yere. But if I fail to my test I will still keep up my Nature studie*s and open a pet shop. And if I get enough money open a small zoo with and avery. At the Moment I know quite a bit About Nature but not enough to be a vet. I like animals. Do you?  Words: 214
