I go to work every day to my Office I am a chief designer I race in races on motor bikes and cars in my spare time I am quite well of because I have just sold two inventions which both fetched a lot of money for me. One was a Jet Fighter that flew at three times the speed of sound and had a laser-beams that was fixed on the nose of the jet and the laser could melt bombs so that it was harmless when it landed except the odd house it fell on because it was so heavy. And the other invention was again a Jet Fighter which could take of from a submarine which was underwater. The submarine was made with a platform. The jet was not Realy a jet because the engine would go out so I made it go because I powered it with Oxygen, I put liquid oxygen in the fuel tank and I made it flow into a small furnace and the servere heat turned the liquid oxygen into the oxygen we know and use and ejected it out to propell the jet along under-water I found that this princiball would not work in air so I fixed two more jet motors on so it could change as soon as it was out of the water this oxy-jet as it was called was found it was useful for the NAVY and AIR FORCE and I am going to Patent the idea and I will make more giant size oxy-jets.
