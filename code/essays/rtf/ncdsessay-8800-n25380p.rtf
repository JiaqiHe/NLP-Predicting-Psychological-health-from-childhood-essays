I am just entering the Kinds Buidings lecturing department for the first time, I have decided to study Electronics and if possible get a P.h.d. in this subject, I regard Electronics as a very interesting subject but it requires a lot of very hard work, well I suppose its worth it because at the the end of the day we're allowed to use all the sports phisilities, and my friend and I have arranged to have a game of tennis at the tennis courts at the back of the buildings anyhow see you later he's starting his speech. Ah! fresh air at last now away to the tennis courts and then back to my flat where I can get on with the model aeroplane I am building, its' mainly made of balsa wood which I have bought with my spare money and after that its away to the night club where I spend alot of my time. It really looks like my old pal here is going to win the game this time for at the moment he's beating me two sets to one and three games to love in the third set, ach! there goes another game to his credit, I seem to be absolutely useless today soon he'l have the match, but never mind I've always got my other interests.
