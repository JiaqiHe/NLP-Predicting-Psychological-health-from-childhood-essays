I am twenty five I am an air hostes I have seen most of the world already and I have been with my company three years. I work from 8.30 am to 9.30 pm I do not get much sleep in fact I hardly get eny. but I enjoy my self tremendesly the passangers are usealy nice and I know them before we land. I own a little red mini and park it in the pasangers car park while I am on duty. I speak seven languages and am not married I live in my own appartment. If by eny chance I get a holliday I spend it with my little black scottie. who is carefully looked after by the lady down below. I live a short way from the airport but long enough away so I dont hear the plains at night. I enjoy my job because I am always meeting people and I can see the world.  Words: 159
