Every morning the night nurses wake me and I dress. After breakfast and pot washing I go into the ward to see the patineit and then wash them. At dinner time I go round with the dinners. When I am off duty I go and see my perants. I lead a hard* but jolly life and all the patinetes like me. After visitors have gone home I Put the present away in the locker beside the paitentes bed and Put flowers in water and take round the tea. Later on I go to the room were I sleep and the night nurses come on duty. I my holidays I spend a long time with my perants helping them and watch my sister doing chemistry. At christmas all of us go round carol singing to the paitents. When I am Older I will work harder and look after the paitens  Words: 149
