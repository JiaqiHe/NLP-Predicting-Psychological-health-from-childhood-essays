When I am twenty - five I want to become a floor layer like my dad . He works for (company). Sometimes he takes me with him on a job. Once he to me to a big school in (place). And he layswooden floors in houses, churches, gymnasiums, and warehouses. After he has laid a floor he burnishes it with a machine and then he laquers it with a french polish. Some times he has to go to places like (place) and he has to stay overnight. I would like to get married and then go to become a floor layer for (company) and to go to different places like my dad did . If I can't get a job with my fothers company I will join the Merchant Navy .  Words: 131
