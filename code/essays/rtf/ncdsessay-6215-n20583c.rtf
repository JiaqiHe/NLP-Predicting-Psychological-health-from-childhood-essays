In the morning I get up at half past seven, and cook a breakfast for my husband. When we are washed and dressed, and have eaten; I drive Michael to work in our Mini. Then I go home and wash up. Mrs White comes in at nine o'clock and cleans the house and polishs silver. She has a time-table for every day. At dinner time I cook a simple meal for Mrs White and I. We both wassh up after dinner and sit outside in the sun chatting over a cup of tea. At three o'clock Mrs White leaves me. Then I go shopping and on the way back, I collect Michael from crittals. We both go home and have a small tea at five o'clock. Then Michael gets on with modelling, (which is one of his hobbies) I sit down to knit at the fire. At seven o'clock we both have supper and then we sit and talk about the day. We go to bed at ten, and read for half an hour. 
     Before I go shopping, a I do some gardening, and shop at fout o'clock for half an hour. While I work, I think of when I was a nurse matron, before I was married. I was a nurse for six years and now I find that I have an easier life, which is more straight forward.  Words: 231
