I am 25 years old and married. I work in an office in (place). I type out letters. In my spare time I ride my pony (name). I go to rural meetings on Wednesday nights. My hobbies are jumping ponies and reading books. I live in a cottage in the country. The cottage has two bedrooms, a living room, and a bathroom and kitchen. On Sundays I go to church. In the afternoon I go picnics and have our tea out. I work a five day week. On Saturdays I do the shopping for the next week. I am a guide captain for 16 guides. I go to the guide meetings on Tuesdays. I like looking after my animals but I do not have time too when I am working in the office. When I am older I hope to work with horses all the time . I hope to train them for selling at showes. I have a car of my own and I drive a lot.  Words: 168
