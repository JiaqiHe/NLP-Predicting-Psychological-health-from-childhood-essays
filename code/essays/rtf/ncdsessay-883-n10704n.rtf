My Life

I am leading a very interesting life. I am a scientific person and so I am working in a science labortory with a man called Professor (name). At the moment we are working on a very interesting drug. I enjoy the scientific world so I hope to go on to be a professor.
My mother is a very understanding lady and so she lets me carry on with instruments all over the place. My brother sometimes gets a bit worried sometimes because he thinks the project I am working on is a drug from blowing up houses and so he thinks if I drop it the house will blow up. Sometimes my father worries to. But I keep telling him there is no need to worry.
I have many other hobbies such as playing hockey. Professor (name) lets me off on the weekend so that i can have a rest on the Saturday and play hockey in the Sunday league on Sunday Over the weekend another girl takes my place that is why I have the weekend off. I have many other hobbies such as stamp collecting, tennis, reading books science and many other hobbies.
When I get older I hope to have a little shop, selling tubes and things for science.
Science, as I ******* you have gusessed, is a very best hobby that I could ask for you get older * you will become a scientific person. I **pect you will enjoy science as it is the most interesting job you could have  Words: 252
