"The alarm -clock goes of with a horrible niose at about 7'o,clock and then it's two hours to get up and about, have breakfast, pack the children of to their school down the road, and then catch the bus for my school, where I teach. I sit down with ten minutes to become calm and composed in. Then in come the children.
""'Lo, miss!"" ""Nice day, miss."" ""What are we having today, miss?"" It's English, so out come the books and twenty childish brains bury themselves in the problems of the past tense.
What has Fate done to allow to be cooped up in one room, twenty children and one grown-up, all longing for escpare to the brighter world outside. (""please, miss, shall I shut the window, 'cause its raining?"" ""Yes it is raining, you better shut ut"" Who said outside was a brighter world? Now we can't even go out at break.) Some people might laugh at that.
Eight hours in school and then, all out. Now it's back home to welcome John and Mary and make my husband a cup of tea. Wash the dishes, the floors, (who invented dust?) and then make the supper, eat the supper, wash up the supper, and then evening. Blessed evening!"  Words: 206
