I work for [firm name] Industry, making the blind landing gear for the Trident, which is a three jet-engined passenger aircraft. At home I work on the garden, or go out for a ride in my car, or build model aircraft. Sometimes I go to work with my next dorneitou*. When its nice and sunny I go out for picnics on [village] common
Somtimes I build thing for the house or garden like sink-units, bookselves, picture frames. For the garden I made a gate, and laid down a new concrette path with flowers along the edge. I have got a flowering cherry tree in my garden which is just coming into flower. I hope to buy some more of the trees so that I cane sell them to people for mony. Once I made my own transistor radio which really works.  Words: 140
