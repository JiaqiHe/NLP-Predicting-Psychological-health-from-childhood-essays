When I am 25 I am going to have a family of my own and I am going to work in a nursing-home and I would go to work every evening and come back in the mornings at 8 o.clock and then get on with my own work at my own house and do all the washing and make the beds and go out shoping in the mornings and get the dinner ready and then after that get the tea ready and when they have had thire tea and then put the children into bed and then go to work again in the evening and then come back in the morning at 8 o.clock and do the work all over again.
