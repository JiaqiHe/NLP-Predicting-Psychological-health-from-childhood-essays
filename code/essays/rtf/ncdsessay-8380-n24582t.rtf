I am a Salesman from a garage in [town]. Lately I sold a Ford Capri to a very rich customer. I have to be at the garage at 8 o'clock in the morning until about 6 o'clock at night. Sometimes I have to take the car there myself. When I took a car to [city] the car broke down miles from anywhere so I had to walk about a mile to the nearest phone box and it took about 2 hours for the breakdown truck to get to me. At home I clean my car and work on it. Last weekend my brother and I took out the engine out on my car. Yesterday I took my mother for a ride in my Austin mini. For my hobby I race cars in rallys and last year I won lots of prizes. I won one of them in the auto cross in a mini copperess.  Words: 154
