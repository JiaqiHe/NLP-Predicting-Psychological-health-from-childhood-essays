I like playing tennis I also watch tennis on television. I work in a shop and get very good wages. My next door neighbour looks after my two children for me. At night times on saturdays my husband and I go to dances. On Wednesdays afternoons I take my children for walks in the woods. I cook the Sunday dinner and the dinner during the weekdays because I have my dinner break at 11.30 am till 02.00pm by that time I have had the food eaten and the plates knives and forks washed up. In summer I have a weeks holiday by the sea-side.  Words: 104
