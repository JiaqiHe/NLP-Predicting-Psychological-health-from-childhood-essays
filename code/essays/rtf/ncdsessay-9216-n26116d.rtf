I am now twenty five, I am a farmer I have been to an Agricultural College. I own quite a large dairy farm in southwest England. I have 40 cows and I rear all the young stock. The food is grown under a 5 acre Greenhouse which is heated, under this Green house the soil is very good. so the crops grow extra quickly. The animals are fed on Hay, Role, suger pulp and cake made from Barley. On this food the cows average about 1350 gallons per Cow at an Average of 4oo00 butterfat. At this rate, I make quite a large profit. I am Married, I have One son called William. and he is three. I am lading an enjoyable life, and I am very happy.  Words: 128
