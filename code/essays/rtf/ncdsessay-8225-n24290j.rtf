When I get a house of my own I'll make a lot of new electronical parts and machines to add. I'll live alone so that I can make a mess without being cleared away so tiederly that I dont no where anything is.
      I'll make up plans and make what I have planed, if suxsefull I'll sell them and that will be my living.
      I'll work also in my bed, making new walkie-talkies so that I can listen in to the piolets eic, Ill then make plans of the planes etc so that I can fix a track of my own.  Words: 101
