New life   I am at the age of 25, got a job and married, we have a flat in [xxxxxxx] and we both work and get up at 6 o'clock. I work in a Bank and teach in a nurery school, I catch the 7 o'clock bus into the center of [xxxxxxx] and jump off the bus at the stop before the bus station. When I get to the Bank it is usually locked so I go round to the back ExiT and go and start work. It is now 3 o'clock and that is the time I stop work, I pick up my positions and go shopping, a few doors down from the Bank is a shopping center, I allways go there after I have stopped work for the day and buy a few bag's of crisps and something for tea, after being in the shopping center I go look around the clothes store. The time is now half past [illegible] and I walk down the road to the bus station catch the bus to [xxxxxxx], this is where the nursery is and so I walk into the nursery and start teaching there, the day is Thursday and sunny useually on a Thursday I take the children to a playground, but I am going to make a different trip and take them to the beach at [xxxxxxx]. 'Right is everybody on the coach?' 'Yes' shouted the children, and off we went.  Words: 242
