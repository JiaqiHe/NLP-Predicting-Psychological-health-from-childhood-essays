When I am twenty five I want to be a football player. I want to play for Leeds united and the position I want to be is centre forward. My house will be a semi-Detached in Leeds every day I will go down for training apart from Saturday and Sunday. When its the end of the football season I will go on holiday with my wife and children to Canada for about one and a half months and there I will have odd little games of football and get sun* burnt when the football season comes again Ill try my best to be a captain  Words: 105
