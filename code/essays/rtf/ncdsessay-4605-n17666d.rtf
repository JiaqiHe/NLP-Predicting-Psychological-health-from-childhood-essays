My age is now 25. I am a proffessional footballer and a shopkeeper. I play centre forward for West Ham United. I am married and live in London. I have two sons who I want to be footballers. I like playing football because I enjoy playing and entirtaining the crowds. I hope I will be chosen for this year's 1984 World Cup in Brazil. I sometimes go to [location] to shoot clay pigeons. My wife is 23 and my sons are 3, and 6 months. I live in No. 6 [street name] [town] Middesex. I hope when I leave football I will by another shop. The shop I have at the moment is a confectioners and tobbaconists. I own a Lotus Elan Sports Car. When we go for our holidays I hope to take my wife and two sons to Spain. The last time we went on holiday we went to Ireland and It kept on raining so we went to Spain and it was very nice. I train every Monday with other players at Boleyn Football Ground.  Words: 178
