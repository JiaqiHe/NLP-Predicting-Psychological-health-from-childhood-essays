"At the age of 25 I shall be marrid. My interests will be cricket and football. I would like a house of my own, with all modern things. My job would be the army in which, I would train to be a radio oporater. In my spare time I would go home to my family, and sit in the garden. We would go to London to see films, one of which would be ""the great race"", and many others."  Words: 79
