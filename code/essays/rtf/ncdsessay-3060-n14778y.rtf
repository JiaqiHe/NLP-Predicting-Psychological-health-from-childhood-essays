I am flying a Hawker siddley Trident it leaves at 10.00 am, so I have to make sure that I have cheked everything before taking off. It is nealy time to talk off there 200 passegers on board. The runway is all clear so I taxi the aroeplane to the end of the runway then I reff up the jets up and then we are rumbleing down the runway, the nose of the areoplane went up and then I was in the air the wheels were pulled up, and then we were on are way to U.S.A. I flew the plane over the Atlantic. I could see the coast on the radar scaner then I could see it through the window, and then I approched the runway I put the wheels down and landed the aircraft.
