I am 25 years old and I whish to be a secutary and have a little office of my own. And then I could settle down in a nice little flat with two of my friends. I will not get married we will have a dog. And when we are earning 15 pounds a week we will go and rent a house. Later on in the year we mite even go on a trip some where. When we are rich we will buy a car between us so we can get around from place to place. We will go and visit our parents sometimes. When I have been a secutary for 3 years I would like to become a nurse and look after a childrens ward. I Know I have to pass a lot of examination but there is no harm in trying and if you fail there is no harm in trying again. But I really want to be  a matrin of a hospital one day and have a nice uniform to wear. So that means that I can drive to the hospital I would like to be a matrin because I would be incharge of my own hospital. But I would not like to stay a matrin or a nurse for a long time because I like to get around sometimes And have lots of clothes mod clothes. And mod shoes And I hop I may lead a nice life.
