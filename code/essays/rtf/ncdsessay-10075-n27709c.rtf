I think I will have a very nice home and I will live at ****. I would do a lot of drawing and painting. Sometimes I would go to the cinema with some of my other freinds. If the baths were open I would go their to swim with my other pals. I would go to football matches a lot. I would drive a car and go for a run out in the country. Me and my other freinds would go for walks and probably got to London or somwhere nice for a week or two. I would have a caravan and go to the seaside with my children and wife. We would stay their for two weeks having a nice time and going to a lot of hotels. I would not smoke but I will drink a lot. My children would be nice and would always go to the wreck with their freinds to play on the swings and to play football. I would keep a lot of birds in a very big aivery and  would breed poodles. I would probably have a colour television and invite all my friends to a tea party to watch it. If there were any dances or cabares* I would go to the civic and meet some of my very old friends and have a fear drinks with them. I would stay in most of the time and watch grandstand on saterdays.  Words: 239
