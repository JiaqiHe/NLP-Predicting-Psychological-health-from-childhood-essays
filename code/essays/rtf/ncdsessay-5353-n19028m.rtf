I would be working as an engerneer. I'd Like to go out to the country and have a nice quiate rest all by myself. I would have a holiday to Africa and take a camara and take films of what i see. I would be in a Jeep hunting for Elephants with an elephant gun. I would rather have a house in africa than in the country side. Africa has loverly waterfalls and nice clear water so clean that you can drink it swim in it and look for water creatures. You can see some of the dangerous cat famaly near the north of Africa where there is the dark Jungles of Africa I'd come home and start work again. The* kind of engineer I would like to be is the one who puts them into the concord supper sonic Jet. Doing this is a most dificult Job because you have got to make sure there is no louse nuts They have got a new divice its like a kind of sand paper stuff all the louse nuts come out and stick to it and then you can put them back very much tighter. This is what i would do if I was 25 years old and had a lot of money. You get paid about xxxx90 a week as an engerneer in a super sonic Jet like the concord an you get paid about 1,000 a year.
