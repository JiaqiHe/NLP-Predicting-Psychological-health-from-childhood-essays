I would like to be an engineer, but first I would have to college and then when I have finished my exams, then I can start learning about all the things I have to do and what parts I have to work on. And when I get a hundred pounds I could buy my own house, then I could get married and then start earning my living and could give my wife some money every week to do the shoping. then we could get some children then I would have a family of my own, and I could work every morning but the I might be late a few mornings, and would use to the time. and when the children grow a bit bigger, we could to Jamaica and spend a few weeks, then I could go to spain and spend a few weeks there, and come back and start working again, then I could go to butlins in the summer holidays and then I could buy a car and go places where I want to go, but I think that I would by a zodiac like my dad had but the only thing I dont like is the rubber in the chairs because when it is hot then the smells. when I go back to work then I have to start building the engines put on nuts and screws. then my hands get all oily break time I have some tea and start again, perhaps when its about half past four then we go home, and we have to leave at nine and fresh again then work a bit faster in the morning but when it is sunny you get all tired out.
