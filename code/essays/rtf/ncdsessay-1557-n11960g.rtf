I am twenty five. I am married and have one small child. She is 2. It is a very busy life cooking and washing for three. I work in an office at an airport. My husband works at a garage and gets very dirty. My child is very good. Each week we earn a lot of money.
In my spare time I knit jumpers and cardigans. Also I make dresses, skirts, blouses, shirts and trousers. Each week I get about one and a half days off. Sometimes I get more.
Most of this time is used in washing, ironing, airing and study. The rest of the time is use for doing odd things. For my holiday I have three weeks.
My child's name is [female name]. When she grows up she will be a beautiful young lady. She will marry a handsome young man. They will live happily. They will have two children, they will be girls. They will live in the country.  Words: 160
