I am 25 years old and if I have two children if one was a boy I would call him [male name] and if the other one was a girl I would call her [female name]. My husband works for [construction firm] and get's about xxxx20 to xxxx25 a week. We are living in [town] in a council house. When our children grow up I hope they will be something useful like a machanic or a commando and [female name] to be boutique owner or a secutary working in an office. I will then be able to go out to work again to buy the thing's we wanted. I would work for a shop or something useful I would not like to be a house-wife. When I am about 35 I would like to go to wood-work to make some tables or something like that, that is not to hard to make. I shall like to work for quite a long while to about the age of 57 to 60 and then I would like to be a pensioner. I do not want more than three or four children and I do not want to get married twice.  Words: 198
