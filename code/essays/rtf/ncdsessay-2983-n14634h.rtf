My work is an air hostess. In spare time I study countrys and learn other languages. I see my parants every orther day because I fly to different places. When flying I tell the people to put on their saftey belts and I serve people their dinners and drinks. The most enjoyable thing I like is meeting important people like the Priminster and maybe the Queen. Sometimes I miss a week from home because of visiting other countrys. When I am home I spend my time studying and sometimes going out with my parants. Also if I have time I do my hobbies which are swimming and Story writing. I lead an interesting life and enjoy my work very much. Im intreasted in Airoplanes and flight and I am taking lessons in flying.  Words: 133
