I am now 25, I am Sarring in a famous play, I am not scared because I've been in many plays before. I 've got a little flat of my own, and I live with two of my friends in the heart of [CITY]. They are also actress'es. The play is for children. It is called PETER-PAN. I am the main character in the play, and my two friends are also in it, one is taking part as WENDY, and the other one is taking part as a sqaw. I'll tell you the plays I have been in, CINDERELLA, GOODY-TWO-SHOES, SNOW-WHITE & the SEVEN-DWARFS, PUSS-IN-BOOTS, and I am now in PETER-PAN. Ever since I was small, I've either wanted to be a singer or an Actress. My Brother was an Actor he also starred in PETER-PAN, as a Pirate. He was also on the television and on films. Well here goes it's the BIG NIGHT.  Words: 155
