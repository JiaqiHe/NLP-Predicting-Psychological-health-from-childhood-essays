If I was 25 I would be married and have a child I would be a hair dresser my husband would baby sit when I was out and I would baby sit when my husband was out I would live in the country in a little cottage. We would try and get a baby sitter when we were going out. For our Holiday we would go to Majorca for a holiday and we would watch bull fights and get brown on the beach. I would have my hair short and then I would have a wig if I wanted it long. I would let my child have a dog but it must be a yorkshire terrier pup. We would have three meals a day and then at night my husband and I would have supper together. Thats what I would do if I was 25.  Words: 145
