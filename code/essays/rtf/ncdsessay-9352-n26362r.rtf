I am 25 and work in office taking down letters and then typing them out. When I am at home I enjoy going out shopping and buying new clothes. I am very interested in buying and looking at flowers in spare time, and working the rest of the time. I am leading a normal life just like any other lady of my age. At the weekends if I'm not working I go out to the pictures in the evening and during the day I tidy up my house and then go shopping. I enjoy living with my parents but I will soon be getting married. I would like to continue living in the way I do now, except for being married and having a family.  Words: 125
