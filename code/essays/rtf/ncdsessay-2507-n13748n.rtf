On Mondays I help my boss with the export figures for our firm. On Tuesday nights I go to night school and I do this for every night of the week except monday. On saturdays and sundays I work in the garden pulling out the weeds and planting daffodills and all the vegadables like carrots, peas, beans, and tommataos In the afternoons I take take the family out for a ride into the country for a picnic. We always go to the penines Because the kids like a bit of climbing not very high and on Tuesday I go to the meeting at the townhall whith all out head representetives there we talk over all the Business we've done a*.
