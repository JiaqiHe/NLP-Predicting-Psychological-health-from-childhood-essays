I wode be married would have a job leading a good life. in my spear time I would go out with my wife. I would like to be an enginer they get paid well and I like it. when I was at home I would go fishing and decorate the place. I would go to the pitchers with my wife on a Sunday I would go to church in the afternoon weed the garden and have a rest or a have sleep and go to work the next day. I should think the work would be all right and after work come home for tea and a rest, and start ealy in the morning. I would have lots of friends.  Words: 120
