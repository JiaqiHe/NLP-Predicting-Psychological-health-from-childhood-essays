Now that I have left school and are in the army I think that I shou'd get married and leave the forces a have a some children for a change. It would be the life, away from all the bullets whizing past you all the time and all the boomes and crashes. The elegent ladies you meet away from all the gambleing. It would be the life not all the grenade throwing and getting up six a.m. Now I whould be able to get up in the morning at say seven a.m have a cup of tea and breakfast.  Words: 99
