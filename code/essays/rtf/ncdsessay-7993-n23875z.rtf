"      At the moment I am getting the dinner pills ready at my home in Skyray city. It is a different place to what you know. Instead of roads we have long twisting tubes in which hovercars go through. In these roads we have lights come on at night. 
      My childrens names are [name] and [name]. They are both girls. At the moment they are playing with their flying saucer. ""[name]! [name]! Come in at once! It is time for your dinner pills."" We have our dinner pills at 4 o'clock your time. 
      Now I have to go out to work at the automatic pill ship on wheels. Tinter the mechanical robot is looking after* the children. My work is to make sure the pills get made properly. 
      One of my hobbies is to take trips to the moon to help navigate the building which is going on.
      I have no husband because he was killed by a meteor when he was on the moon.
      We die at the average age of 109 so I have quite a long time to live.
      My children are very advanced for their age. [name] is only five and she knows as much as what your average 20 year old knows. They belong to the school on wheels. Their teacher is a robot. The lessons they learn are much the same as your advanced teaching meathods."  Words: 235
