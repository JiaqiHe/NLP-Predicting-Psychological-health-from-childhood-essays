I am 25 years old. My job is being an Archiologist. I have not found anything yet. I am not married yet. I had emigrated to Australia when I was 21 years old, but I am now in France looking for Roman fortreses and trinkets. I collect stamps coins and postcards. I have some old Roman coins in my collection. I am leading a good life but when I don't find any forts I get anoid but you can't be right all the time. I have land* to speak French just about. I have found it hard to under stand them but I manage. I can't bare the food here so I go to an English pub and get a bear and a pie or I get some hot food in the English resurant. I have many friends but two of my collaige friends stay with me in a little cottage far away from it all. I wright to my family every month. I can't wright every week because they are all over the world. At home, I mean in England there was a lovely atmasphea but in France the atmasphea is is different, it is browken up. In a months time I am moveing again, we always seam to be moveing. Thats what I mean by browken up. At this moment I wish I was at home with my family because we haven't had any luck, but I must try again. I am going home in six months time, I am look forward to that and to see my family again.
