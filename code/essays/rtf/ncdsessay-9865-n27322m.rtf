My hobby is acting, and one day I hope to become an actress and film star. I work at the [company]. It's very nice and If I do become a star I shall be sorry to leave it. My friend [name] and I work in the s'ame office and we do more talking than work. Its a wonder Mr. [name] the owner doesant sack us both. I only met my bride-groom 2 weeks ago but we had to set the wedding soon because I am having a baby.  Words: 118
