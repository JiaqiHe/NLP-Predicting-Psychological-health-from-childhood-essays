"My life at 25.
I was married when I was 20. My interest is a hairdresser but I only do that in the morning because in the afternoon. I have to do the house work. I don't do much at the hairdress as I have not started long but at least I do not have to just to at my husband. I got my job when I was 24 so I have not been doing it long. Before that I was a shop girl. But I didn't like that job. So one day as I was walking down the road, it was about 8 o clock I think. Well I saw a peice of paper on which it said hairdresser wanted. So excited I went into the shop and asked if I could take the place of the hairdresser. There was a bit of speaking behind the curtian, and then the manager came and said ""what do you want ""I have come for the job I said.
The manager seened* very grumpy I still he said I could have the job. So the next day I went along to hairdresser it was very nice. I have left my job now so I do the housework in the morning. So in the afternoon all I have to do is to look at my husband. So I am in the same place as I was in the begining."  Words: 234
