When I am 25 I would like to carry on doing hairdressing and making cloths I would like a house in the country where it is quite and there is not a lot of huses* and a lot of children around. I would take my children to many different places as I can. I would take them to the Isle of man for the day. I would make then be clean and tidy every day. I would let them be in as many clubs as they like. I would not let my children play with naughty boys and girls and I would not let anyone look after my children under the age of 19. That is what a would do when I am 25.  Words: 124
