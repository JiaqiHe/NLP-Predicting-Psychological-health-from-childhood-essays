I am working in the Royal Ballet school. I get up at 6. 30. AM. I must be at morning class on time. we start morning class at 8. 30. and we finish at 11.30. After class, some of my friends and I go to the school canteen for a bite to eat. we then hurry back to dressing room, which is usually cluttered with humans and tights, ballet shoes, hair nets and hair grips. We work from 12.30 until 2.30 for afternoon class. At 2.30 my friends and I change out of practice clothes into street clothes. we then go into the thearte were we sit and watch principal dancers rehersing. After that we all go home, our adopted home in Some digs. My flat mate and I then start repairing torn tights, worn out ballet shoes, and leg warmers. Then we climb thankfully into bed, thinking of morning, when it will all begin again.  Words: 156
