Start the engines going said the captain to me we will take off on runway 37 in 15 mins. The air hostess went down the gangway and told everyone to fasten their seatbelts we will take off in 10 mins. Everyone listened and fastened their seatbelts soon all four engines were going and we were moving along the runway and then the aeroplane lifted off the runway. After we had been airborn for 1hr the air hostess went down the gangway with tea and giving them each a cup. Then the plane started to rumble and the captain to me to dive a thousand feet to make the plane dive you have to ease the joy stick forward after we had dived 1 thousand feet it stopped rumbling and in a few hrs we saw the runway in front of us and we had to bring the plane down very gently or else it wood bounce off when I landed I made certain that every body got off the plane before taking it to the hangar because it was a long way down the runway.

My interests are fishing and gardening but I mostly do fishing I only have a small bungalo but I will soon save enough money for a bigger house because I have good wages at the airport every saturday I have to go to the airport for training. At the training centre are test planes their is a very experienced pilot who comes in the plane with you and when you are airborn he tells you all the faults I make and their is also a school their where you learn about engines and how to start them when I go home I don't watch much television and I usually go to bed at 11.30.
