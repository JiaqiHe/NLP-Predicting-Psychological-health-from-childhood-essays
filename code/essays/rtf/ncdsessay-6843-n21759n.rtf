I am 25 years old and I live in a bunglo I have quite a few hobbies the first one his painting I like painting scences from out side. and* my second one is sewing dolls clothes I have a job in the morning from 9 to 1 selling shoes at a shoe shop My favourite colour is blue and my lucky number is number 7 sometimes. Many people hate tidying up mind helping. When I was about 11 years old I use to tidy all the rooms I like washing up, but do not like drying The bunglow is quite small, but If always wanted to live in something small Like a caravan or a cottage But I picked a bunglow I am not fussy on clothes but dont like maxi skirts. I have a green trousers suit My favourite clothes I like to wear is my checked mini skirt my blue blouse and my blue cardigian I have quite big feet for when I was 11 years of age I took 3 in a shoe. I do not like swaid shoes but like the colour I do not care much on blue shoes but like brown. I am a in fashion and my favourite shoe style is sling backs. I wear not quite dark stocking and they suit me quite well In my spare time I read books When I went to the cienma to see Iliver I enjoed it very much and would like to see it again some day. Sometimes I knit clothes for people my best thing I knit was a little green helmet, I knit it in a day. I do like wearing trousers  Words: 280
