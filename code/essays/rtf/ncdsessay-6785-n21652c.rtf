I have now left school and I'am a student nurse at [hospital name]. I'am married to a docter and we have two children. And there we live in a small bungalow just big in fact for all of us.
I got married when I was twenty three jsut then I was braving* my three year course of genral nursing*. My two children are twins and they are both girls there names are [female name] and [female name] and also my husbands name is [male name]. Since I got married I am now a partime nurse because of the house-work at afternoons. After dinner at the hospital I go of duty untill night. After dinner I usually come home and go on with the housework and then the shopping and then on Monday I do the washing. After the housework is done I settle to doing my books. I suppose you want to know what happens to the children all day. Well they are in a nursery well at least one of them is the other is in hospital having her tonsulls out. About six o'clock my husband arrives home with the children. They have their tea and I go back to the hospital to do the night duty at [hospital name]. Later when my replacement comes to take over I go and see [female name] which is in hospital to say good night.
In the morning the only reall interest is to sit down and have good read at the paper before I and my husband goes of to work at the same hospital.  Words: 262
