"I am 25 years old i am leading a good life i have a wife and two children. We have a house it is called a bungalow we have lots of friendly friends. The children go to school. The names of our children are John and peter. We live in a little town called [town].
The work i do is a manager of a football team named ""Manchester United"" they have won the European cup once beating Benficer 4-1. I like the work i am doing it is interesting to watch my team play against other good football teams. I am proud of my children because thier health, thier work. They go to a good school. Also we have a car it is called a B.M.W. made in West Germany. we have been camping with our children. We have been to France, Germany, and Switzerland. I am very interested in stock car racing, all the motors clamour with noise sometimes there are even crashes and people get killed i think it is a very highly dangerous thing to do. I think the people in those cars are very brave."  Words: 188
