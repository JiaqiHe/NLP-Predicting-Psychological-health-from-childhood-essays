I am a long distance lorry driver I mainly drive between (place) and (place) . That so long ago I took my fathers place * secretary of the (place). I also play for the team . I am very interested in engineering and always fix my own lorry*fir breaks down but I'm fed up of getting flat tyres sometimes I get a feeling the tyres burst just for fun .
I have a new house out in the ** side at ***** bank the new housing scheme is not very big and there is only about 500 houses and 5 public bars .
we will pobably be going to France for our holidays this year . We will be going by hover-craft or perhaps by a boat with hydrofoils . When we get to France I will probably hire a car and go touring about the country .  Words: 146
