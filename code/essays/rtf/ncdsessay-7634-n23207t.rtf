Now that i am 25 year's old I would like to get a good job like working in a Hotel or a Motel. Or other wise I would'nt mind being a hair dresser . Then when i have enough money i will buy a better and bigger house . Then I shall tried to get married and start a family . I would two girls for my children or two boys , or a girl and boy. If I had two girls I would call then (name) and (name), and if I had two boys I would call them (name) and (name) . And then when my children are at school I would like a small job , like doing the waiting in a little guest house . Then I will save all the money and try to buy a car and my hunsbon will save all his money so that we can go on holiday. For are hoilday I would like to go to Spain . When my children grow up and there children they will want some money to start them off so my hunsbon and I shall give them some untill the can bilt up the *ome money. When my hunsbon and I are old well about 58 something like that I would like a little job like going out and helping people tidy up their house. When i died I hope all my things and my house go's to some one who really needs it. I hope my children will get on all right when i am dead They might have the same life as my hunsbon and I . I hope my life will be something like that because thats how I want it. If it does turn out like that (which I hope it will) I shall have a very very happy life.  Words: 309
