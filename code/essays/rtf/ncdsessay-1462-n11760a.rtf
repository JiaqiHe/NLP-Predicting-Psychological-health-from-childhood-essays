I am living in Sussex by the sea. I am married but still working. I am teaching at a secondary school. Teaching Music and Geography. A little earlier I visited a lot of foreign countries, Russia, China, India, Central Africa, almost everywhere in the world. I frequently compose my own music and play lots of different instruments I belong to several clubs and societys for different things. In the future I hope to have at least four children. but I want to do a lot of things first, while I am still free. I do a great deal of adventurous cooking. now and attend classes at night school (in cooking) I like reading and I read books on several different shubjects every day when I have time. I keep going with all my hobbies. I am a fairly good swimmer and have taken a course on life-saving I play tennis and badminton and enjoy other sports. I love running the house and I love shopping for things especially in big shops. In our house we have maps all over the walls because we are very interested in other countries. Soon we shall take another big holiday.  Words: 196
