I am leading quite a nice life with a little house in a small village in the country, with a not to big Arabian grey coloured car. I have a wife and a small boy, called Leon. I am a production Engineer, which means I desig**n and poduce Engineering things. My interests are football Cricket and Speedway, I am a football referee in the Eastern Coutries League, someday I hope to be a Southern League Linesman, I like watching Cricket and I like Speedway for the fun of it. I also like sailing as I have a small Ding*y which is 10 feet long. In my house I have all things I like. I have a lovely garden with a prospering strawberry patch, it also has several fruit trees such as apple and pears. It is a nice and long garden and behind the garden there is a copse.  Words: 149
