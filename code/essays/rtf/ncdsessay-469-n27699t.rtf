At the age of 25 I am a school tcher tchering 4th and 5th year. I live in a small flat all alone. In my spear time I play tenies with my frendes and some-times I play foot-ball. If it raines I stay in and vedd of lison to the racks. If both a loving I will watch telvision. times I will go to the cinama. When I have enought money I will buy a miny-car then a nice house in the contry with a nice garagie and back gardon of grass. in the froun garden I will have a tar drive with a gardon on each side. the entrence would be like a funal with a pond in the middle so that a car can come in from each side.
