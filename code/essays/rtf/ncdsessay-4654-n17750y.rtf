I am a dress desighner. I desigh quet a lot of dresses. This week I found out old matirale and made dresses for old people I do this about twice a year. My life is pleasent and I like it. I have an old-fashion cottage near [village] in Somerset that is where my shop is. Ever Saturday I take a swimming class, in this we learn them to swim well, so that if they ever are drowning or someone is drowing they will know what to do. I own a factory in Yorkshire it is not very big but it is all right for me. My father's cousin bought it for me. All this I do at night because I still go to collage. This is wear I learn how to desighn dresses and other things. Most people think it is easy to desighn dresses but they are wrong it is hard sometimes you desighn a dress then watch telvision and find out that one has been desighn some thing like yours and you have to start all over ragain. A friend of mone who also is a dress desighner has made a lot of money out of her desighn's she now lives in Paris I will be flying to Paris tommorow and I am going to live there with my friend we are going into partership. I have sold my factory we are going to get a boutique where you can model them a sell them. I will be finshicling collage.  Words: 252
