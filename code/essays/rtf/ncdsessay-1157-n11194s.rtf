----------------------
I am married but have no children, I collect stamps and other hobbys are horse riding, ice skating and knitting. I work as a short hand typist and as it is only part time I have a lot of time in the home. As I have not been married a long time we just have a counsell house, not one of our own. I cook all the dinners and I do not mind cooking as it is one of my hobbies. My husband is a foreman plumber and works every day but Saturday.  Words: 93
