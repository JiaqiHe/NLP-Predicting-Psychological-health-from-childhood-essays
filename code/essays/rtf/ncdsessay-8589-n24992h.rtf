I am living in a big house in Yorkshire. I have one child called [name]. She is three months old. One of my hobbies at the moment is knitting. I engoy swimming alot to, but I do not have a lot of time to do swimming because of my little girl. I dont have a job at the moment because [name] is to young. The only work I do is house work such as making bed washing-up and so on. My hushband is working for a building firm and gets quite a reasonable pay. Ten years have gone by and now I have a job as a short hand typeits. I dont have far to go each morning. My job is part time because I have to be back at three o' clock because of [name]. [name] came back the other day and told me that a girl in the class higher than her was taking a lot of test that day, and she said it was something to do with her birthday. [name] went on telling me that she had taken an English test a Maths test and one all about shapes. I sat [name] down and told her all about it because I heard something about this thing on the radio about a week or two ago. When [name] was grown up and married she had a little son called [name]. By this time I was getting an old lady, and often [name] and he son would come and visit me. A year later [name] fell very ill and died in hospital. [name] had to come and live with me becase the rest of the family was abroad. Soon I died of old age and [name] went to live with his Aunty [name] and Uncle [name] in Spain.  Words: 300
