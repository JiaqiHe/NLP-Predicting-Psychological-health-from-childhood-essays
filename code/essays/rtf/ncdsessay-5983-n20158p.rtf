I hope to be working as a nurse at this age, but I still want to be married I should like to be in a childrens ward or an old peoples ward, though old people sometimes are rather arkward. I do not wish to be working in an operating theatre. During my spare time I shall be resting at home or keeping the child occupied or swimming or cycling. I want to have just one child at  this age and I hope it will be a girl. Her name shall be [name] or [name]. She shall be two or three years old at this time and I hope that by the time she is three years old she shall be going to an infant Sunday School. During days when I am working I shall leave her at a nursery school, or if possible I shall take her with me to keep the younger children happy if they are not to seriously ill.  Words: 162
