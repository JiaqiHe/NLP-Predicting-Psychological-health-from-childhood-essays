Now I am a 25 year old young woman. My life is very normal. I am a very happy woman I have been married for one year. In six months time I will be having a child. My occupation is a teacher at a grammer school. I enjoy this very much. My teaching subjects are Mathematics and Geography. I have been teaching for four years. 
My home life is very quiet ussually but on some days my parents visit us and my husband's parents visit it is not so quiet. At home I like to do needlework and designing. I do not watch a lot of television as most programmes are terribly boring. My hobbies are music and swimming. I am terribly interested in music, I like listening to Back and many other famous composers. Pop music does not strike me very much.
My social life is very nice as sometimes we go to friends at week-ends or out for the evening. Some evenings my husbands treats me to a meal out. 
I have two pets a golden laborador and a siamese kitten. I enjoy my life very much and I think that I could not be happier.  Words: 197
