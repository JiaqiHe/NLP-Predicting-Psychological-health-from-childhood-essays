I am living at [town] a seaside place. I like it here very much I am it in a nice house and I am taking up people for there holidays here. My husband is out working. The people who stay with me are very nice they like my cooking and my house. I will have a dog and if he is nice and fluffy I will call him fluffy. In the winter I will go out to work to do odd jobs I will propply work in a shop in the winter. I will have a nice home. In the evening I would like to take lessons at dressmaking. I will also like to make dresses and things for other people. I would like to have nice and tidy people who stay with me. Every day they would have a breakfast and tea. Every Friday for tea they would have fish and other things. I would learn to keep my do out of the way of the people's way. Every morning at a sertate time I could bring a cup of tea up to them if they would like it. I would tell them were nice places are for them to go. If they like it here I could put them up for the next year. In my spear time in the summer I could do some dress-making. If they would like a cup of tea in the evening's I would let them get one. Then when they are going home I will be sorry to see them go.  Words: 259
