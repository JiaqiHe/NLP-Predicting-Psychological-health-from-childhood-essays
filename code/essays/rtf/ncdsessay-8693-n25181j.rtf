One of them is called (name) and the other is named (name). I have been waiting for (name) and (name) to return home from their journey with there father. They have been away for nearly 6 days in the far of country America. I have been thinking if I should meet them at the airport. I have been working hard Lately trying to get a lot of money for a lovely new house . I have made up my mind to go and visit them at the airport . I made my self get a taxi to the airport . About an hour after I made my way to the airport and waited for them when the plane arrive--ed I saw them I shook my hand and they seen me . When I seen him and the twins I ran with joy . The twins were safe he was safe and that was all that mattered . The taxi drive drove us home to our house again. The man in the taxi said good luck to all of you and when we got home we saw a - big party waiting for us we were so exite--ed that I made the party look even bigger soon we were in our bed sound asleep and in the morning we were deligh--ted . As the weeks passed by the children grew bigger after 6 years we gave thembig birthday party's We had bought lots of new things when we had enough money we bought a new house . This house was to be in South America we went to South America and went to a lovely big city , The children had found more freinds in this big city we have lots of money so my husband (name) bought me a lovely new precious ring there were many precious stones in this ring and we could by lots of things . The children were getting older and I was expecting another baby . After I had the other baby boy I called it (name) as my name was (name) we had been lots of places inAmerica and have been to see the (place) as we were beginning to get older we could hardly go any places now but as there was a lot of places to go yet went to a lot of the places . The twins were getting married and as the other one was getting older to I decided to move on to another place to settle down we decided to goto North America and settle there we were very badly wanting to go there. As the years go past my husband died and there was nothing else for me to do but be a widow as I already am . I missed all my freinds I oved so dearly and th**e I had to go back and see them if only I could have went by taxi and would have been happy againI remembered the time when I and the rest were at the party its was so gay and happy for all of the family as we walked in the door . We were never so happy before in my life and everybody there had a very wonderful time.  Words: 579
