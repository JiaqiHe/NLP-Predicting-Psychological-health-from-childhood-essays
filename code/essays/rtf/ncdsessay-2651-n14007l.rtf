I work in a small electronics firm that is a small way away from out home. This form pays me enough money to keep me my wife and my two children famly comforable. I start work at 8 o'clock and come home at about 5 o'clock. My children are aged 5 and 7 years old. I am the companys manager for production. I have to see that all the jobs we make* get out on time. I am interested in the study of electronics and interested in meta***k. The children all want new toys so I have to work a bit harder or ask for a raise. The firm is gradully expanding and the work is getting harder *r the boss puts me onto a different job. I am now one of the directors who has to make all the large business deals. My pay has been raved so now I can* buy anything the children want. Som I am fairly rich we move into larger have* and I start a small firm of my own. I have hobbies like fishing collecting rare stamps for which I go to large stamp auctions. At home I usually take the children out and we go to fish or go have a picnic somewhere. I am fond of cricket and I am in the local cricket team which has a good record for betting.  Words: 231
