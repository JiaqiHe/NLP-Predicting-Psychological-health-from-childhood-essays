Now that I 25 years old I have deceided that it is time to stop living with my parents and go find a job for my self. I have been to a hair dressing school ever since I left school. I have been employed at a hairdressers shop to see how I get on. I was was up at eight o'clock on my first morning. I arrived there at half past eight. I was to purm Mrs. [surname]s hair. She was in her fiftys. Her hair thogh was awfully thick. First of all I had to give it a wash then then put some rollers up. Then take them down and then dip her hair in this speaclia lotin with has an awfull stink. At last my day was finished and I was employed for good. I had a boy-friend and we were getting married on the Saturday. We were to go on a boat to Ireland for our honeymoon. When we came back we were going to the pictures to see the Sound of music. I have now left hairdressing and have had a baby girl. I have called her [female name]. When she grows up I hope that she will be like me. In my spare time I used to go ice skating.  Words: 215
