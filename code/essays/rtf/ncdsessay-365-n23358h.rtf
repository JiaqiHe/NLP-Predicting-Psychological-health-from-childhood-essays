When I am twenty-five I hope to be married and have two children and have a house of my own. My work will probably be as a house wife. I am intrested in cooking and reading magzines. I hope to be good at cooking. I would like to live in a big house. And I might emigrate to Australia and live there. If I do not get married I shall live with my Mother and Father until I get a house to live in.  Words: 84
