25 Years Old.
I am now 25 years old. My work is in a riding school . We get many pupils and are doing very well. I have got two working pupils who stay with me at my house. Both have left school and are very keen about horses. their names are (name) and (name). They came when they were 18 and are now 20. We have got 23 ponies and 6 horses. Most were bought at (place) but some down South. The cost for a day ride is xxxx2 half day ride is xxxx1. I also give tution which costs 12/6d to 15/- . all the ponies live out excect our stallion he has very soft hair as he is arab his name is (name). (name) and (name) take out the r*deo and when we get beinners the lead them. I give them xxxx6 each week and they put it in their savings like I do with half mine . Last week we went to a sale and saw a lovely little highland mane of 13 **. The feeding does not cost very much as we by so much of it as a time. as it is only (name) that stays in we get about forty *ales on a load so that does us a long time. In the early morning when the ponies are caught they get a feed which consists of a double handful of oats and bran and a measure of beet pulp. They also get a large feed at night before they are turned out into their fields.  Words: 262
