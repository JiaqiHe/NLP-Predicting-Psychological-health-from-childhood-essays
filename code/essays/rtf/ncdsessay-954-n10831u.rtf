If I were married I would live by the sea in a nice neat bungalow and would Keep it tidy.
If i were not married I would live in the town and go to work. I would try and get a job as a secetary, or something to do with typing and shorthand. I would learn to drive a car, and drive it to work. If I got alot of money I would spend 3/4 of it on what I need and spend the left overs on what I would like. I would have dinner at home if I worked, of a couple of sandwiches between 1 o'clock and 2,o'clock. On Sunday's I would have the day off like most people will do, and go out somewhere sometimes. I will have a cat, a dog. and a goldfish and look after them and I will buy a bunny later on I will belong to a public library and go to it once a week regulary. I am married I have a puppy and a baby rabbit and I live in a bungalow in [village] near [town]. Nearly every day I go to the shops to buy a few things. On Sundays I would visit my relations and take my pup with me.
