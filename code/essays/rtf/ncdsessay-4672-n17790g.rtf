My work is a chemist. I mix up medicine. I have a boy who is five years old and we have a very nice home. I work on weekdays only and the houswork is done on Saturdays. One of my main interests are cooking. I made cakes, bread, pies and other things. At home we have a dog and two budgies. Every day the pets are fed and they are well looked after. The job I have at the moment is very interesting. I enjoy mixing the liquids. At school I had to study a lot of chemistry. My son has just started school for the first time. While I am at home I enjoy reading books.  Words: 117
