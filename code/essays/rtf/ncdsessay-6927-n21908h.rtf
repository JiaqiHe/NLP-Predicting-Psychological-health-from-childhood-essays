I am going to get married Next July I am a doctor I work at [hospital name] hospital my Mother used to work there she was a sister. I have always wanted to be a doctor and I am know taking my degree to be a surgen my feonsia is a doctor two but he is not a surgen. My friend is a nurse. I live in a bungalow in [town] which I like very much it is not far away from [hospital name] hospital my pay is good too I get about xxxx7000 a year but I will probably get more when I get my degree as a surgen. when I was younger people used to ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up and I told them a doctor a few didn't belive me but I have my degree to show them now I hadn't then. I wonder what my children will want to be when they grow up I hope they will be like my frondia and try to get a good job. Some people now just don't care but I do and I hope people will think the same way as I do about things too. My cousing has gone just the oposite way to me she is a hippi who has mixed with meope who have nothing to do but go around causing trouble. I hope my children don't end up that way. I do not smoke or drink and I hope my children will not too. I passed my driving test when I was eighteen I got through fist time but me cousin just because he was jealous said that I shoud'nt have. My feonsias name is [male name] and mine is [female name] If I get a girl I want to call her Elizabeth. if I get a boy I want to call him [male name].  Words: 316
