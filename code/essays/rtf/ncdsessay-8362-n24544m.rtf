I am twenty five. I am a farmer on my farm, I keep dairy cows, a few chickens, some horses and donkeys and goats. Every day I get up at half past five and get dressed. I collect the chickens eggs. Then I get the cows in ready to be milkled. I switch the milking machine on and milk them. Then I get a bucketful milk and go and give it to the calfs. After that I get a bale of hay and give it to the horses then I give a bale to the donkeys and then a bale to the goats. Then I take my dog for a run across the feilds. The house which I live in has nine rooms a bathroom, a toylit, a dining room, aliveing room, a kitchen, and four bedrooms. I have three spare bedrooms. Each have two beds in. Outside my house there is a notice saying Eggs for sale and goats milk and cows milk and horses manure and cows manure and goats manure and chickens manure. They are be 3 shillings a bag. On my farm I will have a combine harvester and a tractor and a trailer. I have a car too. When I will have made enough money I will have sheep and pigs and turkeys. I will also have some cats. I have three big barns and in the winter I shall have two of them filled with hay, and the other one with machines. I will have at least fifty cows in a big barn. I have six horses and 19 goats. There is four donkeys. They horses and the donkeys will have a barn each. The goats will have a big shed in their feild.  Words: 290
