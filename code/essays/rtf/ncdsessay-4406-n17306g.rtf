When I'm 25 I'll likely just be finished an army officers training school, for I would like to join the army as a helicopter pilot I do not think I would get married ever . I would like to join a Scots regiment . If I could not join the army I would be an engineeer or electrician. When I join the army as a pilot I would like air, sea rescue operations. I would like to go abroad as much as possible . I would like to see Norway or Canada more than any other countries in the world . When i'm big I still think I would like football, jumping and running as my hobbies . I would likely have to train to be a parachutest in case the helicopter which i was in, happen to crash or fail to work while I was in the air . I would likely have to be a very strong swimmer incase , the helicopter crashed in the sea and you would have to know how to survive on the sea and how to treat wounds .  Words: 186
