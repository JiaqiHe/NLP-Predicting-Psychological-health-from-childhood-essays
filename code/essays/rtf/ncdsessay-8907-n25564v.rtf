I am 25, I have a job as a doctor. I am working at a London Hospital. I live just outside London. I have my own apartment on the sixth floor. My leading interests are the engines of cars and how they work. I have been studying medicine for at least two years. I am leading a fairly easy life. The owners maids of the flat keep the apartment tidy. I have my own car so it only takes me about twenty minutes to get to the hospital. My rent for the apartment is paid by the hospital. At the hospital I work from 8.30 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. I have my own little room at the hospital where I do my writing* work. When I get back home I usually do some reading and some hospital work. Then I watch some televison programes I get two papers aday one in the morning and one in the evening. Sometimes I invite a friend who works with me in the hospital to the apartment My days off are Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday morning I go to nine o clock mass at a church two miles away. I get back a nine fifty-five. Then I prepare my lunch. After that I do some reading. I do nothing spesial on Saturdays just things I think of or anything that needs fixing. I sometimes just take a drive in the car around the outskirts of London. When I get back I do somemore reading and cook something to eat for my supper. Afeter that I write some letters to my parents and relations.  Words: 270
