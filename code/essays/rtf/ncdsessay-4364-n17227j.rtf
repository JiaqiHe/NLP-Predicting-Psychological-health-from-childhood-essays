I am living up near [city] where there is a coarse for futher education. I am studying atomic power. 
      I sleep in a little house on outskirts of [city] with and old widow. I have a nice little bedroom with a very comfortable bed. Around the room there are lot of pictures and antiques. Living next door by a strange coinsidence is one of my class mates at the college. In my spare time, (when I'am not Studying) I go for walks with her or play chess. (she's very good.)
      Ve leave for college in the morning at about 8am it is quite a way away, so we walk to the station then catch a train. The colledge is and old building with lots of thin winding coridors and passesges. 
      Today we had a letcture on the atomic rocket which is being sent to Mars later in the year. We went to some more lectures, then had dinner in a nice little resterant round the corner. (very handy.)
      Then a 5'o'clock we returned back to our digs for a loveley warm stew.  Words: 184
