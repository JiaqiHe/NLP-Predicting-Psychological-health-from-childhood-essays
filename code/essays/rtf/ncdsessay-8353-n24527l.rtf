I am a French teacher in a secondary school for girls, I like my job very much. I am engaged to be married next year, but till then I am still living with my parents.
      I have been to [university] and taken my degree in French so I am able to teach. In the long school holidays I go abroad with my friends, I have been to twelve different places in Europe. My friend and I go round playing in tennis tournaments, we enjoy this, I have met many famous tennis stars. Next week I am going to America to compete in the Beverly Hills Tennis Tournament, so I will have to practise a lot.
      During the term time I get up at eight o'clock and arrive at school at about a quarter past nine, as school begins at nine thirty. I take eight peroids a day which is quite a lot really. The class five A is my real hope I am sure they will turn into French genisus. School ends at four fifteen and I leave at about four thirty, when I go for my tea. After tea I either go out with my financee or play tennis. 
      I have a very full life but I enjoy it very much.  Words: 213
