I am a film star . I spend most of my time rehersing and being filmed . I sometimes have intervews on telivision. I like my job very much although I do not have much time to my self . Most nights I go out to dinners and dancess . It is not very often I go to see any one else on at the cinema or theater. I do not have many hobbies as I do not have very much time to do any thing . If I ever do have any spare time then I love to cook or make my own recepies. I have a boy friend but he does not very often see me except for after reherals in which he sometimes takes me out to dinner . I do not get very many early nights but I make sure that I have one . the night before I do a show or any thing. I have my own rooms in a large house and not many people know where I live. I have a lounge a kitchen, Bathroom and Bedroom. At theaters I have my own dressing rooms . I have to be very early before a show starts in order to give me time to get ready I have people to put my make up on and to help me get dressed . I have to have several baths as I am dancing because I get very hot. I have a lot of bouques and flowers at the end of my shows and sometimes chocolates but I can't many of these in case I get fat. I started this dancing when I was ten and I have kept on enj oying it.  Words: 288
