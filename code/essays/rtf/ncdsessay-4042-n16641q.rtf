"It is now the forth of march and it is my 25th birthday and I have just become my emplyees best and I have just become my employees best tipist I am leading a quiet life and a happy one. I am very intrested in children but I do not want any of my own. I have enough of them in sunday school because I have to look after the smaller children. I enjoy this very much but sometimes they get out of hand and I have a very tireing day because in the afternoon I take some freinds and some of the older children from sunday school to church at stamford. I go at 5 oclock and we get back at 8 to 9 oclock it depends (very much) on the traffic on the roads. And on saterday the older age group of children come round and they make ice cubes in diffrent flavors. such as orange, lemon, lime, blackcurrent, and grape fruit and of course I have to supply the flavors, The rest of my week I have quiet days in the ofice of my emplyee tiping out letters and eassays for him while all my freinds are in the practice tipists room still learning to be a excellent tipist and all they had to do was to do was just tipe while I was hard at work tiping letters and things for my emplyee ""but it was a lovely birthday present even if I did have to work very hard while my best freinds just had to tipe a few words I thought as I smuggled between the bed clothes that night"  Words: 275
