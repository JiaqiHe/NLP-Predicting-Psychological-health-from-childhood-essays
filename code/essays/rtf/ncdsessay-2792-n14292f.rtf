I Hope to be married, I may breed horses if I have enough land, have dogs and other pets as well. Have a nice garden and house. Hope to have part time work until I am about 27 somthing to do with horses or dogs well some type of animals or birds. I hope to have a nice husband who is well of. If we had not a nice garden, but we had a flat somwhere I would like to take up acting or be a dancing teacher at a school somewhere. I would not like in a big town, I would preffer to like in the county near Devon Somerset on a farm if possible. I hope to have two children I would not mind if I had more.  Words: 130
