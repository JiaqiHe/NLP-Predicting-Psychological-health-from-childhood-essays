I live in the country near a farm and I work in the civel service. I have two boys and a girl who are very easy to cope with and very abient*. We only let them in certain rooms incase they should cause damage to any valubles. We are fairly well of in the way of money and have a big old mansion. I started my job a month after I had left school. I married at the age of twenty two and had out first child when I was twenty three it was a boy then we had a girl and then another boy. My main interests are moddel makeing and gardening. Life is a bit hecktick because we have just moved in but we are settleing down well.  Words: 130
