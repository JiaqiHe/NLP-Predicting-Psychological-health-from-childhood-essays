I am a fireman at Leeds and every Saturday I watch Leeds United at Eland Road. A fireman does more than put fires out, it is a much more compicated job and before you're one of the crew you have learn:- what equipment to use, how to use it, how to stack you're equipment when not used, how to change into it quickly* and lots of other things.
When I get home there is still things to do. Look after the wife and children, do a bit of gardening, get the childrens meals ready if the wife goes out and my other odd jobs. But there is always time for a rest after the children have gone to bed we can sit down and watch television together. I don't work in shifts so every day (not incuding rest days) I ge up a 6.00am to be in time for work.  Words: 149
