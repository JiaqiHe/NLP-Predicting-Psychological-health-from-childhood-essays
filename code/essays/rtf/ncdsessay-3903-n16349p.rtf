"I am twenty five years old. At the present I am living in a flat near Susex University. The other stuedents and I are completing our three year corse. I am doing a corse on electrical engineering.

We get money from home and we also ge grants of xxxx60 a term. In to weeks time when leave University I will go home to a job at a petrol pump. That job is only for the holidays. After I have completed that job I will have xxxx75 more in the Bank. I have sent letters to the G.P.O., G.E.C. and to the BAC at Bristol. I have got intervews with the G.P.P and the G.E.C. 
This summer I promised to rewire my hourse. Actually it is not my own house but because the rest of my family live there to. I am a single man. I might in a few years time emegrate to the U.S.A. as pay is higher. Also standards are higher in all ways compared with England. Only people with Univerity digrees are admitted to the USA so I will have to pass my exames which are at the end of my corse which is in to weeks time. My aim is to settle down with a good job in a good country within the next three years. The house I live in at the moment has got many electrical modifications made by me."  Words: 265
