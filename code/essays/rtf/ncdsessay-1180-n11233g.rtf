At the age of 25 I became a nurse before I became a nurse I needed a lot of physical training I spent 5 years at a nurse's training school after that I became a proper nurse I hope to be promoted to a sister - in - charge I would be very proud of myself and would make sure every nurse did her job right. Two years of being a nurse did me good it brought me and my husband together and lin setteling down in my cosy little* home our daughter Maria is only at the age of 4 1/2 years she said she wanted to be a *urse who she grows up of course she meant nurse. Only one casulty wich has died and he died of bronkitus on the drest he was 65 and was very weak in the heart he would have died anyway. I think nursing is the best jot* I could ever have and I'll never ever leave to be something else. My time off is only on mondays and w***days but I don't mind. My husbands job just happens to be a doctors at the same hospital as me and we see each other nearly every day. I sometimes arrive home late and I have to see if tonys put Maria to sheep properly.
