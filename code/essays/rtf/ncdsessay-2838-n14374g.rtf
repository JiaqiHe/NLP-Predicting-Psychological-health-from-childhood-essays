I am 25 years old, and I am a engineer I make radio controlled models, like aircrafts, cars, boats, tanks. I live in a bungalow, in the garden there is a boating pool with a ruway nearby for the model boats and planes. I spend most of my time buiding models. After I have built a lot of models I will sell them all the money I get I will give to my relations to share equally. After I had built even more models and got more money I would get a bigger house and build robots for servants, I would go out and enjoy my self and live with my mum and dad. The house I lived in would have 10 bedrooms for when guests came and relations, the house would have a library and a living room a dinning room a cellar and two attics.  Words: 147
