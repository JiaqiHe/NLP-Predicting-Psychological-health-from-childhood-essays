I am a teacher at a bording* school, I take English in my own little class room But my intrest hobbies*, are far from what I teach, I like playing polo and ice hockey and other diffrent subgeces*, like rock climing too. I live in the town but that is only in the holidays, and inbetween* terms* I have my own private* room. I go out okashonaly to the pictures*, or* sometimes go with some girls out of the form I teach. The children* are very quite and some times very nosey, I like speaking to the parents at the end of terms.  Words: 103
