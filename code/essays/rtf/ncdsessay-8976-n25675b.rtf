When I reach 25 I am going to own my own Horse Stables. The best part of owning a riding stables is looking after the horses like grooming the horses, and exercising them. I would take them on the beach and on the moors and commons. after wa*rdo I would bring it back and rub it down with a damp cloth. Then is *** comes the time for hiring some people and you employ them for their wages i would give themxxxx15 a week.
now after I had apointed the workers I would fix their hours and their work.
*o live in I would by a Manor right by the sea. I would keep the horses two miles away from where my residence was. I would get to know the people surrounding me and maybe I might find a nice enough gentlman and marry him and have 2 children 1 boy and 1 girl. I would name them (name) and (name). I would teach them to ride when they were 4 and then when they grow up and get married they will take after me  Words: 183
