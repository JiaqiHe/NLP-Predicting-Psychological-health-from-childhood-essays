My name is Christine Ditton. I am an air-hostess. I work with three others who are also air-hostesses. Me and my friends are empoyed by B.O.A.C. a big airline company. We are now travelling to Italy, a place I have always wanted to visit. I live in a flat with my friend [female name], (one of the girls at work) and we halve the rent. When I am not travelling I enjoy knitting, needlework, going to the cinema and pop-groups. I am engaged and am getting married next April 12th. [female name] is also getting married, this August, in fact. 
I enjoy my work as my fiannce is the pilot of the plane which is taking us to Italy. We are stopping in Italy for 8 days at the moment which is very exiting.
For our honeymoon we are going to Austria. for 5 weeks. When we come back from Italy we are going to Spain, China and Switzerland. Three weeks ago, I fell down the stairs and broke my arm and I only just recovered in time for the flight to Italy, but I enjoyed very much  Words: 187
