I am living in a flat with my friend. We shall share the household jobs I do not like washing the dishes so my friend does it. We pay every thing half and half. We both like parties. As yet we do not have our boyfriends in the flat we would rather go out because it is more fun. I am a hair dresser and my friend [xxxxxxx] is a short hand typist. I work in a very plesant salon. I have an aprentist working for me and I am helping her to become a hair dresser. I have fiveteen pounds a week and I have tips on top of this. I enjoy my job because I meet lots of people. I have always wanted to be an hair dresser because when I was a child I used to do my dolls hair. I feel very tired on a Saturday as it is our busy day. Usally I leave of at sin o'clock and I have a day of on Thursday. On the evning when I am not at work I spend my time reading. As often as I can I go and see my parents. I get on with my perents more now than what I did when I was yonger.  Words: 212
