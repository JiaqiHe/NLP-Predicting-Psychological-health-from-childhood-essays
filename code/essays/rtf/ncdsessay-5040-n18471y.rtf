I live in [town]. I am married. My home is in [road], I have no children and Still go to work. I work for a rich lady who gives me xxxx five a week, I have the Easter, Summer, winter, Cristmas, and birthday off and ofcause the weekends off. The lady says I can go camping if I want, I have been three times so far but I am going on Saturday and Sunday next week. Our house is as clean as it will go. In the kitchen I have a old fashioned cabinet, and everything in it is the patern which is a reddis blue with bits of cream and lilac and yellow doted here and there and gold gilt around the edges, the brim's, the handles. the inside's, and the bottoms. Only the sugar bowl used to be odd only I smashed it and I bought another only it never had the gilt so I painted it myself. The sitting room has a three peice sweep in it.  Words: 170
