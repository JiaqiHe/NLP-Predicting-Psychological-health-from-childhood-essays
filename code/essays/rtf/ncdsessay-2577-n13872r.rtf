I am twenty-five years old. I work at the zoo in the pets corner. I look after dogs, cats, ponys, and all the baby animals that are born. I wear jeans for my job as it is very dirty, I wouldn't give up my job for any thing. I am married and have one child, and a dog and a cat. We often go out at night when we can get a babysitter. [name], my daughter goes to [school] in Cornwall. We live at the coast of Cornwall and it is very nice. We have a medium sized house with two bedrooms, one bathroom, a dineing room, a lounge and a kiching.  Words: 112
