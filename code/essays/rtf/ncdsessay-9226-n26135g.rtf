I work in one of the biggest schools in [location]. I work from 'half past eight to half past four so when I get home I'm pretty egxasted after a days work. I live pretty far awat, so I have to go earlier than most of the teachers looking after and teaching children what I've always wanted to do so I'm lucky. When I get home I cook the tea ready for my mother, who goes to work at a factory. After that I mark books and everything else that I haven't time to see to at school. After that I'll go out with my boyfriend or stay and keep my mother company. I have many interests and on a weekend I usually do some of them, like going looking for flowers and writing about them or I'll go swimming, or maybe I'll go to the library looking for adventurous and exciting books. But my best interest is lookinh after and teaching children. And that's the thing I do most of. Then on a Sunday I teach a sunday school class. I think the reason I like children so much is because I had a litterler sister and I used to look after her so much. Then theirs my bigger sisters and brothers who were always playing, talking and teasing me so much. My mother and father were always saying I was going to be a teacher and I would say ah mum, dad I haven't got brains enough to go to colledge. But they were right and ended up at a very good school. My father helped me as much as he could, as he was a teacher before he retired.  Words: 282
