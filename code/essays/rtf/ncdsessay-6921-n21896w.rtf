I am now 25 I am leading a very happy life. I like going to ride horses my favourite horse is a four year old white horse. on some of my spare time I play table tennis at a club then I got to play ten pin bowling at manchester. In summer time I work in the gardens of old age pensioners pulling weeds out so that the flowers have room to grow, then I cut the grass, sometimes I even clean their windows. My job is clean and helpful I am a nurse who go's round differrent countrys* to find out the diseases. I have two weeks holiday every summer. In those two weeks I go to Majorca and I visit my friends who own a hotel near the sea I have left my job as nurse and now am married with a daughter aged 2 and a son aged 4, my husband is a 2nd mate to the captain who assists the QE2. My children have just come back from Majorca after been invited there by my friends and now we are all together. Oh I did not mention that my children have a nursmaid who they call nanny.
