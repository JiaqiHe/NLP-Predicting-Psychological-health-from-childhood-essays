My job on the farm is to groom the ponys gleen the tack give the ponys plenty of exisive , keep the stable , clean , feed the ponys . My day starts at 6 o'clock feed the ponys. I go to the house have breakfast glean the tack sadle up wate to the boys and girls come and go for a ride .
We go through town into a country road . Up to the river give the ponys a rest as well as ourselfes . We mount up then go to the road and to an other part of the river . We had brought a packed lunch or we had not to go back , about 3 o'clock . Then I have to groom the ponys it takes about an hour and a half since I have to groom 15 ponys the man that helps me does 10 ponys so it is not very much to do .
