"I have just left acting school and I am acting in a play called ""Little Gypsy Gay"". I am not going to do telivision plays because, it takes such along time to do it I live in Scotland on the isle of [island]. My self and my husband own a little farm just outside [town]. We keep sheep, cows, and chickens. I go over to the mainland once a week to practise for ""Little Gypsy Gay."" I am a qualified actress. The rest of the week I help at the farm. We also own a little cafe the other side of the island. I ride over on my horse Tuppence some-times to help. My hobbies are swimming, stamp collecting, Horse-riding
      We have a tudor farm house which is quite small. We have lots a acres of land.
      My husband is an Italian named [name]. He is the one who looks after the farm. He used to be a teacher at my acting school, but when we got married he left, to look after the farm.
      When I retire from acting at about sixty I hope to go and work in a kennels. My mother lives with us. I hope to have a long life, and eventually go and live in the swiss mountains near where the story girl Hiedi lived"  Words: 220
