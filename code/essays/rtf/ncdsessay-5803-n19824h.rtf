I would do a job like flying in the R.A.F. or in the Navy but I would in all my spar time take my wife and children abroad so that they could see other countrys. and I hope to have some o,levels and A levels and GCE so I could get a good job in the world. In the R.A.F I mean test flying, so I would ern lots of money. And I would like to own a cottage in the country all away from the trafick and the town and cities with all wild life around I would have a small dog for the children like a shawawa. I would like to own a nice car like the capry or the viva Gt and I would take my children out swimming and fishing and for picnics at the week end And I would invghte friends to my house for tea and I would buy the children lots of presents and sweet when I come home from work. And I would encourage them in there work and in sports. And I would try not to grumble to much. But I would keep the children under controle. And I would own a house near the sea so on holliday we could live there. And we could go swimming in the sea and we would all be happy.  Words: 226
