I am a typist and I work in a big office in Fleet Street. I have been typing since my 11th birthday when I had a typewriter for my birthday. I enjoy knitting and sewing clothes for children. I read a lot of library books, and I have a lot of plants.
I live with my parents in a big house in [London borough]. There are four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and two W.C.s The lounge and dining room are very big. The garden is enormous, there are lots of pretty flowers. The gardener looks after the grass and flowers and he does it very well. 
His name is [male name]. We have two cars, and a double garage. 
We are going to France for 5 weeks for our holiday in June.
When I am very old I want to knit a lot of blankets to send to charities.  Words: 146
