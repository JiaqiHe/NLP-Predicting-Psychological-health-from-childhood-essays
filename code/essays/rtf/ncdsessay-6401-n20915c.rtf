I am a typist at a firm in Newcastle. I am not marryed. I earn xxxx13 a week and in my spare time I go riding and I like to paint pictures of animals mostly horses and dogs. I like animals and have a Spanial and a Great dane. I like things like colecting. On Friday I go to the guides and help them with the ones trying to get there Trefoil. We go for hikes and go camping a lot but best of all I like to help. On Thursday I go to the cinamar and see the Walt Disney films. My twofavourites were a Hundred and one Dalmaitions and The Lady and the tramp. I liked wind in the willows as well. I saw the Jungle Book also.  Words: 130
