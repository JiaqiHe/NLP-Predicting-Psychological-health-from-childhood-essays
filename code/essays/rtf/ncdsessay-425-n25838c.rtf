The day had come I was 25 years old, and I felt like stopping in bed all day and sleep. At 9 o-clock the kids came jumping on the bed asking for some money for the shop that comes round every day. I jumped out of the bed gave my self a jolly good wash and went down stairs for breakfast. After I had eat my breakfast I kissed my wife goodbye. I stepped inside my Ford Capri and drove off to work. Outside the work there was a notice saying [xxxxxxx] and I decided to take my wife and children there, thats if i have a good days work. That day I had worked hard all day and I was in a very pleasant moude. Then suddenly I heard that my wife was going to her mother's house for the day. I was in such a rage that I could kick my self to death. My twenty fifth birthday and I wasn't going anywere,I was in such a rage. I drove home to fetch my brife case when I bumped into Craig my youngest child in my family. I asked him what he was doing out [illegible fiche - of] school, and he said we have a half day off school for being champions of the football league in our school. So I took down the town to by him a pair of hipster trousers and a ski jacket thats if he likes ski jackets. And all the things that I brought him cost 35 pounds all but a penny, that knocked a hole in my pocket. Was I glad when that day ended  Words: 275
