I live in the town, near by a cinema I have a four room flat, which I share with [male name], who is eighteen. We both work in a science place for young men. it is good fun finding out about chemicals in the lab. everynight we go out in the car the about two hours, we have triuph 2000 a red one which the roof can come off. Our work place is near a power station. alot of smoke floats about in the air right over our work place. Hardly any women work here, but it is very enteresting. in my spare time at home I some-times go and see whats on at the piture's. I like seeing film's the best, sow does [male name], but they are not very scary as most people say, I thing they are relaxing to get rid of all youre trouble's, but soon they come back to you again. Some times I go for Jim in a Jim club.
