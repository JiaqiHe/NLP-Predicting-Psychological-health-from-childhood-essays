I have got a job as a Dancer and I dance all over the world. The first place I danced at was by myself at London and I was there for a fortnight so that I had plenty of time to see most of London. Next I was in Paris for only a week and I had know time to see the sights, because I was to meet three French dancers who were going to make a team and asked if I would like to join so I decided to joined them. The very first time we danced all together was before the Prince of Wales but as it happened one French dancer took a fit at the news and was unable to dance before the Prince. When we got back to London we were all very sleepy so we went back to our hotel. A few months later I got married and had children so I was forsed to give up dancing and think of the life a head of me. I was very bored when the children went to school so I often went to see my friends who were also married and had children so we all went to seek the children from* school and all did things together.
