At the age of 25 I am a vet, I chose this work because I have always loved animals, the first animal I ever had was a car called Sooty at the age of seven and we rescued that from drowning, I decieded then I would like to be a vet, I have been a vet now for two years, and had to train at university for four years my surgery is in [London suburb]. I was given it on my twenty fifth birthday so I have only had it for three and half months. I was given it by my my husband [male name] I married him when I was twenty. I met him at university he was training to be a builder and have his own buisness, which he had not got as we were both at university we could not get a very long honeymoon so we had a week at Spain. [male name] has long hair and is fairly tall (about 6ft 3ins.) Well now I have two children both girls aged 4 1/2 and two months the eldest is called [female name] and the other [female name] the other day [female name] started school she enjoyed the first week by then she decided she didn't like it but still who could blame her I certainly coud'nt. we live in a new house with a wood and fields all around. At the weekend we all enjoy a ride either in [male name]'s old car build 1963 or a ride on two horses lent to us by a farmer near by whose wife owns a riding school of course when we do this we leave the children at home with my mother. I also enjoy taking my old english sheepdog for a walk, well I wonder if any of this will be true when I'm 25.  Words: 309
