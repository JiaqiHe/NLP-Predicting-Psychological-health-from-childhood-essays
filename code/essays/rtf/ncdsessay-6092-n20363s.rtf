IF I did not suceed I would like to be a mortor Macanic. I would get tips from my brother who will be a apprentish with the Dockyard. I would like to travel around the World. I would like to do any kind of sport in my spare time and do some reading. I would like to go on day trips on Sundays to do some swiming and go for walks over the rocks. I do some fishing and cetch some fish for tea and live a happy life.  Words: 126
