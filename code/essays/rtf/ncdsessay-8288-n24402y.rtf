I am not sure what I am going to do yet, but I would like to get a part time job. Because I am interested in piano, and recorder playing, I would also like to go on with this at times, and not loose confidence. If I cannot do all this, I will stay as a House-wife. If and when I get married, I would like to live in a small town, but near the shop, so that I do not have to go by bus. It would be nice to have a little shop, where we can sell sweets. Then, we would not be too lonely, because of the people coming in and out. We could by a car, and then we could get around the country a bit, and see all the lovely sights around, us. On sundays we could sit down and enjoy our selves by the fire, and watching the television programs at night. In the house we would need about three bed-rooms, in-case any friend's came to stay for a while. I would enjoy going for picnics in the summer days, when it is very hot. We could have a little lawn at the back, with a fence round it, and a little pond in the middle. I would not enjoy making the beds every day. As well as that, I do not like drying up the crockery. If I had a family, I would like to have a girl.  Words: 245
