On a morning I would get up about 6, O'clock and get my husban'd breakfast ready. When he had gone I would wake the children (prefferably two) and get them ready to go off to day nersery. Usually they start crying but today they didn't. When everybody was gone I would get my breakfast. At about Ten o'clock I would get ready to go to the town. Usually the streets are very crowded and you have to push your way through to get to a counter Then it takes you about half and hour for the girl behind the counter to serve you. So by the time I get home I am thankful for a cup of tea. after dinner I do a bit of kniting for half an hour and then I do so mending. After I've done that if there's not much to do I get out my sowing maching and start making a dress or somthing for a Teddy Bear or for a big doll. If I make some-thing for one of them I've got to make something for the other one or they will cry all night. At 3.40 I go to the day nersery to collect them. I don't send them to the nersery by themselves because they come round to collect them in a minibus. At 7.30 my husband comes home.  Words: 227
