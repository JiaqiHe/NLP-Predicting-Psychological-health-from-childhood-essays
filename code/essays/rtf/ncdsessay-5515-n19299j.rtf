At The age of 25. At the age of 25 I hope to have a pop group and have long hair a leather jacket and cuban heel boots. At the same time I want to go swimming alot and increase my speed. My interest will be studying vintage and veteran cars and composing records for the group. The life Iam leading is good because of the money I get, I have a wife and five children three boys and two girls. My home life is pretty good because I life in the country in a big manor like house and there is nobody to bother us except the occasional people passing by. I take my sons camping about three times a year and go abroard once a year with the rest of my family. In July I hope to go on a tour of Britain with the group. At home I spend my time decorating and making things for the children and in my spare time I either listen to the radio or watch television.  Words: 175
