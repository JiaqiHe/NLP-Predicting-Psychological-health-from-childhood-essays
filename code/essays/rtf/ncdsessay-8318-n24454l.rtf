I landed the lightning and went to my room it was fun flying for the R.A.F. you had a chance to fly all types of aircraft fighters, Interceptors and Bombers. The one I had just landed in was the English Electrict Lightning a fighter bomber of the R.A.F. In another week I would be on leave and  be able to go home. My hobbies were carving models of jets out of wood also I had a pet dog which I looked* after. I fed him took him for walkes and exercised him. When I left the R.A.F. I planned to work as a zivil airline pilot. The following week when I got home I found my dog Brock waiting for me as soon as I had got home and got changed from my uniform into normal clothes and took him out for some exercise. I usually just take him for a walk but this time I took him to the field and let him run about. It was lovely to be at home again but when I went back to the R.A.F. station I decided I was a lot happier flying than I was lazing* about in an office.  Words: 199
