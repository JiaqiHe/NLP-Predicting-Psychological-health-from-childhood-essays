After dinner the dogs are exersised out in the fields then I go home and play tennis or I practice atheletics for 2 hours. By that time my dad is back from work I make the tea then I go to buy ice-cream for my kid sister (who is 12). After tea if the wheather is fine we all sunbathe or my sister and I go swimming. After that I go to bed or to the womens club.
