My husband will be home at half past six, we will have our tea at seven and at eight [female name] will go to bed. In the morning we have our breakfast and go to work I work at Woolworths in [London area]  on the toiletry counter. There are people that come and ask for something, and if we haven't got it, go of moaning. there is another girl working with her name is [female name]. She is a nice girl. that hardly ever moans or complains, and very helpful. After work I take [female name] to the park or her aunts. Actually I am leading quite a peaceful, my husband and I hardly ever have any arguments of any sort. I must admit we are getting on very well together. I am very interested in stamp collecting and model making no I am older. Sometimes I would take [female name] and [male name] to the duck pond fishing ([male name] is my nephew by the way).
