I am now 25 years of age and happily married with two children bot boys, they are 5 years old. I am a sig****itee, (A man who paints shop signs and things like that). I am constantly having telephone calls from shopkeepers and landlords of puplic houses, or I was* and such like, wanting me to pant a sign of some sort for them. I once had a man wanting me to paint a picture of myself on a sign for him, although I didn't know what he wanted that for, and I never found out. When I have not got a job to do, I usually sit down in an arm-chair and entertain my children by drawing pictures for them, or I take them out for a walk by the river or go in the park and play ball or something with them.
