I am married and have two children they both go to school. I get them up and send them to school, then I go off my self to school as I am an infant teacher. I get to school at 8.45 a.m. I teach at [school name] Primary School. It is the first day of the Autumn term when they are just starting school, a lot of them start crying because they do not want their mothers to leave them at school by themselves. Their mothers leave them and they soon stop crying. After that they play with jigsaws and work out puzzles. Some of the girls play in the Wendy house and some of the boys play in the shop. The other's either draw or play with any other toys. For the last part of the lesson, They have learning some sounds from the Alphabet. When I get home at five o'clock I get the tea ready and then have a little to eat my-self. Then I would start tidying up starting with upstairs - first the bedrooms, next the bathroom, and tolit. then down the stairs and hall before doing the lonige and dining room, After that I get the laudry basket, and start doing some washing, put some in the machineand wash coloured things by hand. Then after I hang things over the boiler. and at. 8'O'clock send the children for their washes, then I would sit down and watch a little television before doing some knitting for the children, making a jumper. At 10.30. p.m. I would go to bed but read a little in bed first.  Words: 271
