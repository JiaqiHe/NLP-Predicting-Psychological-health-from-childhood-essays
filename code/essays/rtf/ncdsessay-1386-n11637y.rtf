I am 25 years old I am leading a good life I am married and I have one child I would go and work in the Royal Air force and I think I would engoy it there. I have not a lot of children like I said I have one which my next door neighbour look's after while I am at work. My husband drives a steam engine and he does not get home till late. like me I don't get home till late so whoever gets home first gets the tea ready and gets the baby from next door gets it ready for bed then* give the baby its tea than takes it to bed. But its always me that gets home first so I do it all. I like my* work very much and so does my husband I am interesting in my life and furture.  Words: 148
