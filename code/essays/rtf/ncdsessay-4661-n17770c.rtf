When I am 25 I would probably be teaching because that is what I want to do. At night I would go out with my husband if I was married. I would be a part time teacher because of having children.While I am at School I Shall get a lady to look after my children. Sometimes I would take my Children out in the afternoon visiting friends or going to the park. Also I shall learn to drive because it would be helpful to have a car when I have Children. I would like a boy and a girl. I would Sometimes get a baby sitter at night so my husband or a friend and I could go to the cinema. I would often pop round to my next door neighbour to ask her if she would like a cup of tea I Shall enjoy my home life in the afternoon.  Words: 151
