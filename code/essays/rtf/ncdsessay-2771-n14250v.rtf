I am now twenty five years old and I am still living with my parents and I am studying electronics at university in which I am very interested. I have passed my driving test and have a mini minor. I spend my spare time doing experiments in electronics I am also interested in model aeroplanes which I take out to the park to fly. In university I build electronic and electrical circuits and also invent them. I live at home with my two younger brothers. In the holidays I usualy go abroad to Spain Germany and many other countries. At other times I build things like hovercrafts and small aeroplanes  which I power with small petrol engines.
