I have just left Scince Univesity and I am hoping to become a cemest and a techer at [town] engenering collage of teknollergy and be living as far away from [location] and [town] Cement factroys as I can.
IF this is not posable I woo would like to be traned for the R.A.F. and again if this is not posable to go and live in singapore or astrala in Brisbane. 
I am still very cean on stamps and have go all the up to date ones from England and U.S.A. as I have some frends there at the momet and hope to be frends with there children as I am at the moment and also maybe to be able to viset them very five years or so and I am hoping to have 3 children but the thing I would like to do most of all is to be a headmaster or jst a master in a bording scool in the country were it would be nice and quiet all day long as long as it was a privet school. and also that the scool was farly old and it had great wood panerling. This scholl I would also like to have big gound with woods and playing feilds etc.  Words: 209
