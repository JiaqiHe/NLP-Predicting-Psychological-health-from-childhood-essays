When I am 25 years old I will be married I hope. I might be working at home as a house wife or I might be working some-where else. I might have some children by then. If i work out side some where I want to be a nurse or a hair-dresser. But by that time every-thing will be different, much different from when I was at school. I won't be doing home work or drinking school milk or having school dinners. I will not be living at home with my mother + father. I will be free to do what I like. 
I shall not be told off all the time. I will be looking after my children or I shall be looking after people in Hospital.
I will be looking at grown-ups T.V programmes. I will have made friends with people. I shall be cooking my husbands dinner or tea, supper or break-fast. My mother and fatehr will be old very old. Peirherps my granny and grandad may be dead. My friend [female name] will be married and 25 years old like me. My friend [female name] will be 25 years old like me al-so.
