At the age of 25 I would go out quite a lot, and help my parents. I would like to work as a builder climbing up scaffolds and putting up blocks of flats and houses, and I would get quite a lot of money and I would give my parents a lot of money, and put some in the bank. I would like to be a manager of a big firm or play for a football team, win medals, cups and shields it would be great, I would be on the television, or be a manager of a football team. I would like to go to Swizterland for my holidays and go skiyng down hills in the snow, I would go by a big boat because, when you pay for your fare you are paying for your food as well, and you can go all over the ship, but on  a plane you could'nt walk all over because you might bother the pilot and he could go wrong with the controls and he could crash because, they do not have parachutes on planes, but on ships they have life-belts to stop you from drowning. for Christmas I would buy my parents big presents like a gold watch and a solid gold ring for my parents, they would be very happy with ther* presents and for myself I would by a car, it* would be a sports car, and I would buy an animal and it would be a dog, it would be an alsation and I would name it wolf, that would be a good name for a dog, but I would always help my parents by cleaning up the rooms, doing the shopping and clean the windows and do the washing when my parents are'nt well. If I was given a lot of work I would'nt go out, I would go into my bedroom and keep doing my work till I finish, because if I did'nt I could get the sack, and I woud'nt like that because I might not be able to get another job and we would be very poor without food or drink and it would be horrible and we could get chucked out of our house for not paying the rent, and we would have no where to live.
