I am now 25 I am an engineer on a ship I have not seen my wife for 4 years I have one child a girl called [female name]. Being an' engineer is very exiting you see how all sorts of ships go. The ship I work on is H.M.S Emay she had broke* down at sea because she was crippled by a torpido. She might be smashed up but not if I can help it the engine room is big its the biggest I'v seen the enging is big but she needs a new one put in by the engine makers. I have plans on all navy ship's they are very complycated and hard the captain of the ship isnt to pleased with what I have to do to the engine Now she go's as good as new.  Words: 139
