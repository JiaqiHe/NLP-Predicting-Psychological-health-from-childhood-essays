"I'm going to work now mum, good-bye. Oh and I will be working over tonight so don't make my tea early. I'll have to pick up [name] on the way to work because I said I would. Oh lovely, its soccer tommorrow and our team is at the top of the league. Here is [name] now. I wonder if he is playing football tommorrow. Hye [name], are you playing tommorrow. ""Yes"". Here we are at work. Doesn't that big sign on our works look effective. [name] Brothers it says Wow its half past nine already. I had better start working. Inspecting glass is a pleasent job and I enjoy it. Good it's nearly dinner time I think I'll pack up doing this and go for my dinner. I think I'll have lamb and chips. Ahh I ve finished and I enjoyed it. Now then I'll have to go and inspect some more glass. Time flies doesn't it, the hooter will  be going soon to show that it is time to go home. There it goes. But I have to work over. Hey its my birthday next week Im nearly twenty six. Half past seven that means its time to go. Let me see now, its Friday today so it must be Saturday tommorrow and that means football. Who do we play tommorrow I think its Liverpool. Oh boy I'm looking forward to my tea I'm starving. Soon be home now the next bus stop is mine. I'm home mum is tea ready. Oh she isn't in. Now then, what does this note say ""Gone to your aunts be back at eight fifty. Your tea is in the oven"". The western is on tonight so I think I will stay in."  Words: 290
