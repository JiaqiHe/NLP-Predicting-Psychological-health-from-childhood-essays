I am working in an heir-dressrs and I'm getting well paid.
My spare time is used in the bingo and the club.
My home life is allright I am marred and I have two children.
It is a fair pay at the heir-dressers ever sins I was a little girl I used to combe my mothers hair. when I got to the big school in the top class I asked the teacher iff I could stay on and lern how to do hair so that I could be an hair dresser. When I had been in for a year or so I was one after that I was sent to a proper Hair-dressers.  Words: 110
