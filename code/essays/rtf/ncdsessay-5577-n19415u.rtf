I am living in a in [town]. I work at a libary. When I write story's in my spare time. I live alone but on sundays I go and see my mum and dad. They live in a bungalow with [name] my brother who is in his last year at school. When  I go on holiday I ussally go and see my sister [name] or my brother [name]. Some times I go some where, where I can find a good place to for the things in my next story to happen Some times I go and play tennis with my friend. I have just decided to try and write a play. Plays are much harder because I have to think very hard what every body would say if they were in a frightening situation. Not all my books have been published but some ones that have been are in the libary I work at. I feel proud every time I look at them. My dad does n't work any more because we all earn enough to look after our parents. I am hoping to get one of my friends to come and live with me because some times feel lonely. I enjoy working in a libary because I see lots my friends there changing there libary books. A ll the people that work at the libary are very friendly at christmas we often give each other presents.
