When I am 25 I will want to live out in the country and bake alot and have a pony and two children a girl and a boy. I would like doing house work but I dont like washing up. I would like to live fairly near my sister. I would like to go swimming occasionaly and I would like to be a piano teacher and play for a dancing class. I would ask my mum and dad of they would like to come and stay with me. I would go abroad for my holiday and I would like to go to America with my sister. I would watch television not quite so much as I do now and I would not smoke.  Words: 123
