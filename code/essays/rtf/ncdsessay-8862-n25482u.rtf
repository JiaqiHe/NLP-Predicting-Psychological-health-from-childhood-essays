+ If I was 25 I would like to be married to a greyhound owener with fairley lot of money. I would have a big house in the country. I would not like to live in the town. I would have two children a girl and a boy if possable. The children I have will go to a fine school. The work I would do would be a nusery nuse like my mum. I would have nine childern and my two own. I would like my husband's own work beside looking after the grey hounds to be a farm or an offic* man. I would like my husband to be a diver and be would teach me to dive if I could not. We would have two cars a big one and small one. And we would have a pet dog for the children and a cat. We would have a big garden with flowers and some fruit trees. We would have two gardens back and front. We will do our own gardening. We will have nice clothes and plenty of food I would do my own shopping. I would go a night job from about 6 o clock till 10 o clock when I had put the babies to bed I would ask my husband to look after the children why I was at work. I would go out some nights and I would have a babysitter and a cleaner.  Words: 241
