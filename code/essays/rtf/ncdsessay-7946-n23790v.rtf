My daughter will join the choir when she is eight. I knit and sew alot. At the moment I am knitting a blue jumper for my self. Every Sunday we go and watch the cricket match. My brother plays in the [village] team. I am a member of the Woman's Institot. Later month I went to a film show. In [village] village hall some people put on a play. It was called the 'Mikado'. I thought it was very good. Every year we do a play and a funny fashion parade. This year I modelled a night-dress.  Words: 133
