Having left the Navy I would do one of two things; either be an insurance broker, or a school master depending whether I ** passed a great deal of ""O"" levles or ""A"" levles or not I * was to be a school master I would choose a suitable school and teach science and maths (maybe French). I would also have a part-time job, maybe book writing even. 
      If on the other hand I decided that I would be better off being an insurance broker I would probably work for [company]. In my free time I* would probably work in the garden at home. In the holidays I would go abroad with my family to Switzerland, France, or Maybe Australia. I would carry on living like this untill I retire."  Words: 165
