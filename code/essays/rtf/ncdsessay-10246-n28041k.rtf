I am now 25 years old and I have a husband and a boy and girl, twins 5 years old . I am very happy and so are the children. I take the them to school in the morning and start work at 9.30 am . I hop that my husbound is happy at this work , he *** works at the (company) factory . I am a secetery . I work' every day except Saturday we go into town and have our dinner and shop. I don't have very much time so in my spare time I sit down and read or sew. Then put the children to bed. On Sunday we go to church and then we take them out for a walk to exersise our legs . We reapt the whole routine again each week.  Words: 138
