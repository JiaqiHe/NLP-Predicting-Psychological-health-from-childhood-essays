----------------------
I am now 25 years old. I left school* when I was sixteen. At school I learnt to type and* I am now a typist for a buisness man. I am happily* married and have a daughter of 4 who attends the* infant school.
I enjoy cooking and keeping house. I* like to go to dances and the cinema, and go on* picnics with my daughter and husband. I like swimming* and play acting very much and usually do* these in my spare time.
I would like to go to Spain this year* for my holidays, but it all depends on if my husband and I can save up enough money.
I like my job as a typist very much. I can do shorthand as well and this is a great asset because more jobs are offered if you can type and do shorthand as well. I do not think I would like to be a typist all my life I would like to take up acting. I would like to act in plays. Dramatic plays and perhaps if the chance ever came along a film.
I would like very much to own a horse and ride it far out into the country,  Words: 199
