My life at home is mostly spent with my husband and with my children if not I am very often up to my eyes in housework The life I am leading is a very diffrent story if I am not doing diffrent people's hair I am doing my own or my mother's mother always finds some-bodys for me to do or my little girls I am very thankful that my huband does not want his done  Words: 119
