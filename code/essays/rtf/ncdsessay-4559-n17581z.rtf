I would like to be a football** and play for chelsea and be a goalkeeper. I would like to let no goals in and also be scotland's goalkeeper but I cant because I am not scotish. In my spare time I would tear a few cau*er and some bullocks. I am will be married but prehaps have a girl freind. And have lots of friends and live in chelsea. Not far from CHELSEA and some times play cricket on a sunday. I would have a morris 1100 car.  Words: 88
