I am now 25 years of age. I am leading a normal and happy life. I am also married and I have two children. My occupation is a hairdresser. I like it very much where I am working, the customers. are very nice exept some who get niggely at times. I have been at the hairdressers for six years. My job before was at Telephone-house, but I left after two years. My home life is very quiet. I have a baby-sitter in to look after my children, for they are only small. Before I had children I worked full time at the hairdressers, but now I only work part-time. My interests are reading and watching television but I do not have much time to in which to do these things in. When I have a chance to go out of an evening I like to go to the cinema or somewhere of this kind. I like also in the evening to do some art or drawing. I like cooking very much, expecailly when we have company. I do not like sewing very much, but I like knitting. My life is very happy which is indeed very important.  Words: 197
