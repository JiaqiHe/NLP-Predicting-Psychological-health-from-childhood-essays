I am just geting up for work. I work as a libirain and I help people look for books. I get up at half past seven each morning. I have my breakfast and then I get washed and dressed. When I am all ready I go to work. I work at [library], in the childrens libairy. I have to catch a [bus number] bus to take me to [suburb]. Most of the children come to the libairy after school. I have my dinner in a res raunt near by. The libairy for children closes at 6 oclock each evening. When I put all the things away and put my coat on to go home it is about half past six. Then I catch a [bus number] bus home again. When I get home my mother will have my tea waiting for me. After I had my tea I would watch telivion. If I am feeling very tired I go to bed about half past nine. On saturdays I only work half day. There are quite alot of children which come on saturday so they keep me bus'y all the morning finding books for them.  Words: 194
