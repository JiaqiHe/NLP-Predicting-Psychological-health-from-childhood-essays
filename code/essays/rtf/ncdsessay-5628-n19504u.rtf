I am 25 years old and I live in a flat and the life I am leading is awful dificult. I am intereted in studing about things like History and Geography. I like working at the university, class because there is lots of things to study at the university school I have two children on of six and the other of seven. There names are (name) and (name). My home life is very interesting because I like working in the house. And the house work is very good. In the morning I get up have my breakfast and of to the university. Now I am finished the studing at the university. So I will get to stay at home and look after the children. Now I will get to take them to the fairs in the aftenoons. And now that I am left the university I shall be able to do my shopping at home and do the house work and I will get to go out at night to see the football matches at the pitch . and I will be able to make the dinner because when I was at the university the children had to take there dinner at the school canteen now that I am not working at the university they will be able to come home for there dinner because I am there to make it . But I am going back to the university to work and I will leave the children with out next door neighbour and she can look after them. In my spare time I take the children for a walk to see the animals that are in the field. I like working with my hand in my spare time as well.  Words: 291
