My name is Mrs [name] I am 25 and live with my husband at [address] West Germany. At least that is where our house is but with the exeption of holidays we hardley ever live in it for more than one or two nights in a row. Our jobs and hobbys keep us away. My husband is a member of the first team of the [football club] and their nickname the Wanderers is well suited, for unlike other Football Clubs this one is financed by a rich Dollar Millionare from America. This millionare only pays the mens wages when they have beaten an away club that has its ground more than 20 miles away from the home ground. So all his career is made of is touring to away grounds mostly abroad. I am a pilot and test most of the new aeroplanes that are built at the [airport]. This job often takes me to parts all over the world. The job also gives me good pay and for a holiday in the summer you can chose to go to almost anywhere and the company will finance it. Naturally if I can I will go and watch [name] my husband playing and I should think I am the loudest cheerer in the crowd when his team score for it means more money for [name] I also enjoy playing and watching tennis, swimming, climbing and hiking. Once actually when I was 17 I swam for England in Munich in the ladies 400 metres and won a silver medal. (In the Olympic Games)  Words: 261
