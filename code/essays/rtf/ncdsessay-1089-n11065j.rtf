I am a docter just finishing my training. I share a flat with two other people, they are finishing their training as well and it is geting late so I start to make the dinner because of studied cookery at school. I am making a rissotto I gett on fairly well with my friends. The other people are one student nurse and a doctor we all seem to get on fairly well but I sometimes get the feeling that there is tension mounting up. I left home when I was nineteen I had been doing full time study at college pre paring for this training. My salary is not much but if we all band together we manage quite decently. At work I came up to matron and had a talk with her she is not the old battle axe people say she is very under standing and see's my point of view. I have passed all the exams so far but I still have the theatre job to do which I am not looking forward to because I can't stand the smell of anesthetic I will have finished my training in 6 months time. When I am at home I like to paint oils and model clay I also like to roast by the fire in the winter with hot crumpets to eat.  Words: 224
