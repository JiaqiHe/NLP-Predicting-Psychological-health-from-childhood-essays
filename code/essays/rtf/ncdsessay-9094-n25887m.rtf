I work in a bank, * is very interesting. We are * very busy, many people come in & ask us if they can take out some money or sometimes they ask us to change cheques. In my spare time I like to play tennis or go to the public swimming baths. At home I usually do a bit of studying because I go to collage on the weekend. I like to read a lot to. I often go up to my studying room which is my bedroom realy, Mondays & Fridays are our busyist days. at the bank. As I remember the first day at the bank after getting A levals & O levals at school & at colladge I was quite interested. Most of all at the computers & the alarm bell, because the alarm bell was the only one like it in the world. And there was another gadget which told you if there was a gun in the bank. The manager had one of corse, but his was protected against the mecabusen of the alarm. After a while I got used to all the strange happenings, & got to like my job very much. I work from eight o'clock in the morning till seven in the evening which is eleven hours all together. After three years had gone I had finished my training at collage. we had an hour for lunch break, but there were always replacements just for dinner break, so the bank would not have to shut. There are about Fifty people who come to us for servise. so we are always busy as I told you.  Words: 273
