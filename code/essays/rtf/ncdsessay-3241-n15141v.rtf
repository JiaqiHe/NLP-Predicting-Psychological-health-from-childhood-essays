I would not get married I would live with my brother and my cousin, I would be a taxi driver and a footballer, I don't know what my brother or cousin will or would be. My home life would be reading the newspaper doing the garden work or mending the television if it needed mending. If I had enough money I would be interested in buying a car but only if it were a good one, My brother and my cousin might do different jobs from me, I don't know really, my brother has never told me what he is going to do neither has my cousin.
