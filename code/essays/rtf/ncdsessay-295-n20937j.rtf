By then! that was just the telephone about the cross country run on saturday. I managed to get a longer leave this weekend, its a tiring business operating airlines. At home life is very quiet nothing really crops up except a few bills now and again. When I have leave off it's usually almost spent by fishing and now and again a few runs. This Friday which is tomorrow I'll be staying at home I'm expecting an important message from group captain Fores about a long duration flight with a learner aircraftsman. At the moment I'm waiting for the wife with the shopping I just missed her as she went out. The airliners all right easy to operate I mean but its 102 squadron I'm worried about which is my some time post I hope they aren't in trouble again last time they were messing about with a jet turbine engine. Anyway here comes my egg and chips: be seeing you.  Words: 161
