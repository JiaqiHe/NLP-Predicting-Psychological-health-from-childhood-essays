I am 25 years old I work in the army with my mate Corpral [surname]. Tomorrow we are going to launch a new Atomic Missile but it is a pity I will not be there for I am on leave with Corpral [surname] for he is going to get married to a wrac called Corpral [surname]. While we were at the church we saw the missile go over, seconds later German bombs came down. We all dashed for the air-rade shelters CE and I got the boxes of first aid and amunition. As the siren screamed over the district antiaircraft guns were wheeled into action. I who was married to a Corporal [surname] went to see a poffesser sergent Shepherd who is a car designer to make me a war head for a practise rocket 
Two weeks passed 19 of our planes were shot down. the c.o. made a truce and asked why they started bombing us they said that the English bombed the Germans oil supply. Later on the Germans found out that the Japs bombed the oil.  Words: 179
