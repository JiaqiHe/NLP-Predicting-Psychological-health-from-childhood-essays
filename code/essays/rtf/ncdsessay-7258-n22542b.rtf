A day in my life. I am living in a flat in ****** dr. A 8 eghit oclock I go out to work. I am a secetory* at ******** paper factory. The factory is near ****. I live in ******, at the factory I do alot of correpondense*. I have to aswer a lot of letters and bills my lunch hour is twelve to half past. I usually go to the factory canteen. But sometimes I go to cafe. In the afternoon I do more correspondence. Work finishes at five oclock I go home and have some tea. I usually read in the evening but sometimes I watch television. The first morning when I started work wasn't very nice. I had to take about four messages. One time I ended up in the factory canteen. But I am getting to know my way around. Every week I go and visit my parents. They* still live in ******. Somtimes I only* stay for the day. Sometimes for a long weekend. But I enjoy get back to work again. I have not been at my job very long. Only a few weeks in fact. Before I got this job I lived with my parents. I was looking for a job for quite a long time. Before this job I had another job but I got sacked for being late 5 times running. Actually I was quite glad I got a new job. This is because I did not like the work or the boss. Way* I was late 5 times running was because, I had to do a lot of work at night.  Words: 271
