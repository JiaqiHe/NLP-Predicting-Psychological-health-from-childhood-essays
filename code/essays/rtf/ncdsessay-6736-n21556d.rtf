When I am 25 I hope I am happily married and have got two children. I hope they are both boys. I hope I will be working hard at my job as an architect. I hope I have got a house of my own and have enough money in the bank. I hope I have car of my own. In my spare time I think I will either take my family or play cricket or football. I hope have a steady income of xxxx20 aweek.  Words: 85
