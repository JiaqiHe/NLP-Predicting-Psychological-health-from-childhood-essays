My name is [name] I head an adventourous life in the Navy. I do not have a home of my own and when I bin on leave I come home to see my mother and father. In the Navy I scrub the decks clean the misiles and I am an electrical mechanic. At school I was a good footballer so when I am on leave I genourely have one or two games of it. I wear a Navy blue uniform with a big colar. And an hat made of cloth. It is blue on the top and round the edges it is white, with the name printed on it H.M.S. [name]. When we dock in at a port we go to night-clubs and enjoy ourselves. 
On my last voyage I can remember going through the Panama canal in South America. My work is not very easy and I get paid every month. I love bouncing over the waves on the Ganges.
At the age of 17 I was going to take up football. The address of my home is 62 [street name], [town], Wiltshire.  Words: 183
