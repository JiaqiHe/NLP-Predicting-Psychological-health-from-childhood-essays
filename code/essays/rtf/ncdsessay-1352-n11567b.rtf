I' am an Artist I mostly paint animals and people I like painting and drawing best of all. I have copied paintings from books, I am now twenty-five years of age and I enjoy being an Artist, A long time ago I went to an art exhibition and saw one painting which had a water hole with trees and flowers round it, and a herd of elephants drinking from it. I go to a College in [town]. One day in my spare time I might paint a picture of a donkey going along the country road with a dog a cat a cockrel behind him,  Words: 105
