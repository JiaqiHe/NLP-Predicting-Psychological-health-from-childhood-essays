I live in a house in [town] near a small playground I work with my father in a firm called [company]. I work 14 hours a day. I have a renaut with such a shape that it could go 190 miles an hour, it has a radar system which stops it from crashing into another car, it has a kind of tracking device which keeps it on the road. I like building models of ships and cars but not to keen on earoplanes. I like badmington, running, jumping and playing football I train every week. I hope that some day I will become a proffessional. I like site seeing, camping and fishing in my spare time I somtines go climbing. I like going abroad where I can go yatching. I like animals especially dogs and cats. I like drawing and painting s*cenes. I am a test pilot at a earoport near to where I live. In the end I have aboat 4 hours a day to watch the telivisor  Words: 169
