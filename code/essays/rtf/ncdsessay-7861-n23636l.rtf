I am in the Navy for when I was young I did not no what to be so my mum told me to join the Navy and if I enjoyed it to stay there and if not to leave but I like it here and I shall leave when I am in my fortys and get another job somewhere else but I might stay longer if I can help it. I work as a pilot for I like aeroplanes vey much. So I shall do my best and enjoy my life that is ahead of me. I am also interested in machines and I myself know that I must be very careful on them and on areoplane and to check everything so I can safely get of the ground without crashing.  Words: 131
