When I am 25 I imagine that I would be married and have a job. I supose it would be a swimming instructor and teach children or grown up to swim and dive. I would not have a great big house and have a millionere as a husband, but a nice quiet place in the coutry and live in a bungalow. I think my intrests would be swimming and horse riding. If I am going to be a swimming instuctor I might have quite a bit of time for house work for egsample spring-cleaning, sewing, knitting or seaing to things about my work.
If I had any real spare time I supose I would go over to the lokle farm and see the horses and calfs and perhaps lambs if there were any. When my husband comes home I expect we would have tea and then for the rest of the evening sit in front of the fire and watch television or listion to the radio. For our holidays we might go over the Channel Islands somewhere like Gurnsey and stay at a nice guest house or hotel. My Husband might work 2 or 3 miles away. He would probably work in a shop or office, if he worked in a shop it would probably be a small won. At christmas we might go and stay at our Mothers place with the rest of the family forinstance my brother and his family might meet there and my husbands family and we might have a good old time eating and drinking all the time.
