When I am 25 I hope to be an infant school teacher and my main subject should be P.E. or music I would do this because mummy is going to be an infant school teacher and she never has any spare time in witch case she hardly ever gets board. I hope to have a husband and one or two children. I would like to stay in **** and not move from the house I live in bat* I will have too. and so I will live down **** somewhere at the top. I hope to be fairly comfortably off and have a nice house. I if I have a husband I hope his working hours won't be to late because I don't like being on my own. I would have an elaborate names like Elinad for a girl. but a plaina name for a boy Ian of steven or david. I also hope to have a golden labrador or a red setter, a kitten and a rabitt for my children a white one. I would also hope to own a riding stable and have four horses a black a white, a chesnut, and a daplgrey one.  Words: 197
