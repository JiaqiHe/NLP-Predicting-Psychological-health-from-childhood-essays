I am in the army. we have just been stationed in Malaysia because of riots. Last night we came in at Ten O'clock. This morning we had to deal with a riot there where about 600 people rioting over all the rats in their council houses and the slums. I got a bottle smashed over my head but lickily I didnt feel it because of my helmet. We where equipped with a baton a helmet and a shield. My friend Snoopy got face injuries from bricks and stones. We call him snoopy because is always snooping around the camp. For dinner we had corned beef. Then we went back to the riot, to find that the people rioting had trampled all over them. Then they ran to the presidents house. Then they started shouting. We had to get reinforcements from neighbouring islands. When they came we where tired because we had to hold them off. Soon they drove the people back and they went peacefully to their houses  Words: 168
