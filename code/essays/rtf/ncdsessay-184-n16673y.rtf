Or sometimes I go to the pictures. Sometimes on Wednesdays I help my friend in the shop. The shop is a very small sweet shop [illegible fiche - whole page missing]. if there isn't one I give them to some children. The girl called carol comes round and see if I want anything from the shop. Usally I do and I give her sixpence from the shop. When I grow older I would like to be a violinist I practise it at home. When I first started I was terrible, but I'm improving. I would like to play the piano to but I've got enough with the violin. Sometimes I play it in a show which the village puts on once a year.
