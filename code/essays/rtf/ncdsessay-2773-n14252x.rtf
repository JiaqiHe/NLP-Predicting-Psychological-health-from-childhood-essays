I am 25 years old. I am interested in sport. I live in a house in [road] with my parents, I have a very good life. I go out to work very day and come home at 5-o-clock at night. I work in a big factory in [town]. in this factory I make soap. and other things. I wear nice dresses somtimes and they are short. When I come home at night my boyfriend comes and calls foe me and we go to the cinema or the cafe we have a nice time. In my bare time I am a doctor for animals. We have a lot of animals at the hospital that need my help. I am going to get married soon and have some children but not yet. I am going to move soon and I am going to live at the very top of some flats I am going to share this flat with a pen friend I met at school. I am going to leave my work at the factory and be a teacher at a large school in Holland, but first I have to go to a collage to learn about teaching. I hope to soon go out to New Zealand my hoilday with my pen friend. The flat is fairly large with a big kitchen in it and a very large dinning room. The flat has got 2 bedrooms in it and it is right near the sea. My friend and I went to visit it the other day and we liked it very much. when we came out of the flat we went to visit the sea and from the window of the flat we saw the boats in the harbour and everything. Then I started to buy some furnite for our flat and a carpet its looks very nice now and I allways write to my parents at home.  Words: 317
