My work is very in tresting I am a gamekeeper in a park in America. In my spare time I go fishing and shooting. My home is a big log cabin after my day out in the park I have another sort of job nursing animals it is just like some home work. My home life is a bit bouring because I live on my own and I ownly see [name] once a month when he brinings my food a suplis. Some of my hobbys are fishing, shooting, and I sometimes I go bird whatching I ownly have some time for this about once a week because most of my time I have work to do. The best and easyest part of my work is every 6 month when I have to round up the animals for marking and shearing. When I am not at work or out enjoying myself I do some reading I manly read things which are about what I have to do. About once every week I go out to see if every thing is ok with the animals if there is any of the animals hurt I take them back to my cabin if they can fit in the truck, when I get them home they are seen to and if they are ok they are set free the next day but if they need seeing to they are put in the pens till they are all right. If it is to cold to go out to do work and there is none I can do in my cabin, I sometimes right back and tell people what I would like sent to me next.  Words: 279
