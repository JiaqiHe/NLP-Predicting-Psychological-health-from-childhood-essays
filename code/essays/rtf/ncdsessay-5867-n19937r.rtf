"I am walking down the street towards the garage to where my yellow and green Rover 2,000 car is. My blue garage door is now being opened and now the car door is being opened. Click ! goes the key in the starter and off off I go to my work at (company). The road is quite icy as there has been an overnight frost . I see that the big red gates have been opened so I can drive straight in. The building is full of (company) vans , their panes of glass and, their tools and the tables for working on,
As a manager I would prefer to be a worker as they do all the glass cutting etc. I like going out with the workers and helping them but that hapens very seldom as I am usually doing other work assigned to me by (name) my boss. I am usually found , just before dinner time , making some tea for the workers and me t , but not for my boss as he is usually away home for his lunch before I am.
Soon after my lunch I am again working and if I hurry I maybe can get time to help some of the men , After that I am away home hoping to receive another tasty tea from my wife Eating my tea quickly I think of which fishing flies to use tonight after I have finished my tea . Soon my meal is finished and through to my room I go to get my tackle which I am taking with me. I am just going out of the door when my wife called to me saying, ""Have you got your permit"", and I replied ""Yes"" , ""I've got it here in my pocket"" so off I went the river ."  Words: 305
