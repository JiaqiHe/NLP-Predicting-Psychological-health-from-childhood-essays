Evry three weeks my mother and father comes to see me, and evry mounth my brother, 28, and my sister 34, comes to see me I love pets and we are very pleased to get more but with a baby we have to be careful. I also like horse riding across the country side, my husband does not like me going for he is lelfed {left} with the baby (his name is [xxxxxxx] [lastname]) The baby is one year old and can just walk I am hoping to have a baby agin and I hope it will be a girl, but eny-thing will do, a girl or a boy, they as lovly as each other I think I love children as well as pets and babys, that's why I teach them. I go out two times a week to a dance with my husband (we get a baby sitter,) and I go to a bild. We have a small house with a big garden which we do not like digging. In it we have three bed-rooms and a bath room and three rooms down stairs.  Words: 228
