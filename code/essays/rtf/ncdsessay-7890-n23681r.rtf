I am twentyfive years old I have three children and a husband who is very handsome. I work as a part time cleaner. But sometimes I work in a shop. I have a dog and his name is lassy. I have a four bedroomed house with a kitchen dinning rom and living room. My children are all girls with short dresses which are in the fashain. My children have all long hair. The childrens names are [name], [name], and the youngest is [name]. I live at [village] their are some cheeky people there but still I like it I wouldn't give my house up for the world. My children get on my nerves but I love them all. When the ice cream man comes I always by the children an icecream. But if I dont get my pay and I'v no money then they only get a 4D cornet. I love my children very much they are all little darlings to me. I thank God for giving me such a wounderful life and family. I have a butiful garden.  Words: 179
