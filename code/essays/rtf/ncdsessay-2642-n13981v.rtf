"When I am twenty five I hope to be a succesful dress designer and also marry an attractive girl to be my chief model. We shall have a nice modern flat in London because of my work and a nice old cottage in the country for weekends and holiday it will have lots of nice antique furniture and lots of nice brass. whatever the fashion might be I would like to make something a little diferent with gorgeous materials and I hoep to travel abroad for some of my material. my salon will be white with bright satin curtains and a white carpet. 
The Roayl family I hope will come to se my gowns and I may turn the queen into a ""Swinging with it"" Queen. If my business is good I hope to buy a flashy Red sports car to travel to the cottage in. My hobby will be cooking and horse riding if my wife likes horse riding I will buy her and my self a nice horse I hope my wife will have a good stomach as she will have to eat my master mixtures when I get cared away in the kitchen."
