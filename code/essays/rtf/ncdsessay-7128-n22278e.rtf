I am 25 years old and I am a nurse. In my spare time I play tennis and hockey. I find nursing very pleasant and interesting I am often on duty in my spare time. I sometimes work with the little children. I take them to the park. I live at home and I have two children 5 and 6 I have been a State Enrolled Nurse for three years. I find that I prefer to eat at home than at the hospital. I like to do cooking a lot in my spare time. I get one day off a week and have about four weeks paid holiday. I make lots of dresses for my children I do all the house work myself. I walk to the hospital every day. I am saving up for a car. I like to knit. I prefer day duty to night duty. I have taken part in many operations  I play hockey for the hospital team and travel all over the country doing so. I like gardening I do it almost every night I like to go on walks  Words: 185
