"I like to enjoy myself by going out to dances with friends I often meet boys but I never had a permanent boyfriend until now I like him very much and we plan to get married. recently my mother was ill and I had to go to Ireland I was over there for a mouth and on the night of the 14th of November 1985 when she died I was heart-broken I did'nt want to go backs to England and my boyfriend was getting very worried so he came to Ireland to see what was the matter and I told him about my mother and he told me it was no good brooding over it for the rest of my Life. So i took his advice and came back to England. Very soon we got married and I settled down very well and we had a happy life together our children took over form us and their children from them.
Now I must tell you about myself I stand 5'6"" I studied to be a teacher and I was teaching for 1 year when I got married and had children I have short dark brown hair, blue eyes and a short but Long nose,"  Words: 203
