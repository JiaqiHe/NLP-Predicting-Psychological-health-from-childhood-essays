When I'm 25 years old I want to be a Kennel Maid and if I'm lucky I want to own some kennels of my own. In my spare time I want to write a book about dogs and other animals and in my holiday time I want to see the world. If I get married I want to marry a person who is intrested in animals I want 1 boy and 1 girl. I want a house in the country where I could keep some horses I would also like a farm. I would have 1 car and 1 van. The van would be for taking the animals out and about the car would be for going to town in ect. my hobbys would be going out at night and looking for animals that come out at night  Words: 138
