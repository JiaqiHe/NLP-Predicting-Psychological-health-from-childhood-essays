I am leading a very pleasant and happy life. I often go out in the car for sight seeing. My intresests are wood work and making modles fishing and reading. I lead a very good home life and I like working in the garden all the family enjoy their life. I keep lots of rabits and birds. I take our dog into lots of shows I very much enjoy going on holidays. espcealy a broad. I enjoy my home life in a little cottage in the country with a lovely garden. My proper work is a footballer I play center forward and left wing and I like the job very much and I get to know more and more people. Sometimes after a match we all have a party. When I do not play football I have a super market to run. I like that very much and I can make friends with a lot of people and sometimes I go out with them and we have a jolly time together. The football team I play for is Leeds.  Words: 179
