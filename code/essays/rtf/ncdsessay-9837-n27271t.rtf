My daughter has just had her 3rd birthday. My husband has been in hospital lately because of very bad shingles. We have had our new tea-maker which is working rather strangely so I am taking it back to the shop tommorrow. The book I wrote has been published and we have had xxxx60 for it. My job is going very well and my boss has just given me a rise. On Sunday we are going to visit my mother-in-law who lives in [town], we will go by train. My daughter had her second booster yesterday and she was very good about it. Next Wednesday is our anniversary, and the hosptal are letting my husband come home to celebrate. My daughters pet dog has just had 3 pups which look exactly like her in all ways. Baking-day tomorrow evening and this time I think that I will make some rock cakes as my daughter is very fond of them. We went to visit uncle [male name] last week and my daughter has learnt* to say all the names* of the farm animals. I am trying to teach her all I can about such things as the alphabet and counting before she starts school so she will be well ahead in her education. The flowers in our garden have come up beautifully and I intend to take some to my mother-in-law when I go to visit her, I think I will take he some Anmomey and some Lilly-of-the-valley.
