I am interestsed in Swimming and I am good at working in the house I work in a post office and I do some typing When I get a day of my work I help my mother to do the house and I go to the shops for some of the messages then at dinner-time When my yonge brothers and my father Comes in I give them there dinner then When they are finished and they go out I do the dishes that have been used and then tidy the house up . But when i am a little older I would get married and I would be doing all my own house . And on a Saturday I would go out shopping and I would go down to my mothers house and see if she is keeping well. When I go down to see my mother I would bring her a big bunch of flowers and a box of cakes . And the children sweets . On a friday night I go to the Swimming-baths and on a Tuseday night I somtimes go to the skating I think the skating is quite good I can skate round the ring about ten times and then my legs go quite tired I go to the Swiming and the skating with my freinds .
