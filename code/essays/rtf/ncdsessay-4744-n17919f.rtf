If I was 25 yearsold I would have a job in my father's mill. I would be married and my work would be mending the waggons. Still I would be interested with the nature of birds. At 25 yearsold I would hope to have a house with two children. When I am 25 I want to be well off but not rich. At that age I do not want the qarel with my wife at any time at all. I would all ways be early home from work and have Sunday off. I want my house to be old because I do not like the new houses and I do not like liveing in an aveny. My children would all have pocket money and they would not have a knife until over seven. I would not smoke and drink only at christmas. I would hope to have a televishon for the children. I myself would try and take place in all kinds of sports.  Words: 164
