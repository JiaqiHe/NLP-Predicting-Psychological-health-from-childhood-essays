My name is [name], I am 25. Every day, except for a three week holiday, I go to work at [hospital] where I am a Staff nurse. I am in charge of the children's ward and I enjoy my work very much. Every month I have a weekend at home with the family and I make the most of my time there. I am a keen sports-woman and I enjoy swimming, ice-skating and riding. I have my own Palomino stallion called Honey and I Love riding him down the many country Lanes that surround my home in the Dorset countryside. Last week the nurses and medical Students of [hospital] had a rag week. The medical students dressed up as highway-man and held up cars for charity, while we nurses entered a four poster bed with a sail for the local regatta. We didn't win of course but we all had a lot of fun. My ambition is to one-day be a flying nurse in Australia and look after the people who own ranches or cattle stations out in the bush.
