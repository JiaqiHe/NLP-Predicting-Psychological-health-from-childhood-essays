I work at London as a grocer in a large store and I get 19 pound a week. I live in a small house near [town] and I am not married in my spare time I watch football. I like my job a lot and would not swop it for any thing I know quite a few people and I know nearly all our football players. being a grocer is good untill you get the ackward customer and then I wonder if a grocer is as good as I think. It is not very often xthough that we get ackward customers. Nearly always they are easy satisfied except for the odd person. I own a car which quite often helps it is a miny van which is big enough for what I whant. My miny has only broken down once and that is a good job because it normerly costs a lot to put wright which is not surprising.  Words: 159
