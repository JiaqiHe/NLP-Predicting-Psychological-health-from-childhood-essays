The Life of An Architect
I am an Architect I design buildings for a firm called [company]. I specialise on designing buildings like skyscrapers. I live in the country only two miles out of the city so it is easy to get to my office in the city. The house is situated only a mile and a half from a river and I go fishing there every Saturday except for some Saturdays when I take my wife shopping. My father was a fairly wealthy man and he bought the land and the material to build the house but I designed the house. I have two children who I take to the swimming baths every Sunday morning. Here is a description of my working day. I get up at Seven o clock have my breakfast go to work and get there at Quarter to Eight just in time to start work. First I sign the plans I have done the day before and finish it off. Then I start another plan. At twelve o clock I have my lunch break which last for an hour. After lunch I do the plans for a bit then I dictate some letters to my secretary. I leave work at half past Five and get home about six where after a hard days work I put my feet up and watch television. At night when I lie in bed how lucky I am to be an Architect and have a family to look after. My children go to a school in the city so I take them their in my car every day and drop them off there. Altogether life is very rewarding.  Words: 277
