Now I'm 25 years old and I got a fab car one of the latest modles with its jet engines it can do 110 m.ph down our twelve laner motorway. On Saterday I go and see Manchester United playing at Old Traford Then on Monday night I go down the club and have a pint on beer and a game of star-dart. I got a small house in Hawkesbury. At work I drive one of the 200 m ph Electric trains. In the cab of the train there are tens buttons and one hand throttle. And of corse a brake. I drive the train from Bath to Hull. On the way I stop the train at Oxford. It does not take long to dig the garden with the two way digger.  Words: 131
