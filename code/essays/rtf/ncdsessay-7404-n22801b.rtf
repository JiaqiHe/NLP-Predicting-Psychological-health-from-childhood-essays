I live somewhere in Ireland with my husband and five-year-old daughter. I go hunting often on my horse with my husband. My daughter has been riding for a year and a half now and I have been riding for 18 years. I work at a kennels for dogs and cats, 5 days a week. In the spring and summer I jump at horse shows and sometimes judge. I have 3 dogs, a terrier, an English setter and an Alsation who go to dog shows. I live in a large, long bungalow with 2 fields and 3 stables. The village I live in is very small, so I know everything that goes on here. My husband is a horse dealer, keeping all his horses in another town. Sometimes I write the odd book, mainly for children. My goes to the village school which she quite enjoys.  Words: 145
