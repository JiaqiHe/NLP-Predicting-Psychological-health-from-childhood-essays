----------------------
I am living in my mother's house, and have no fixed job or intentions at the moment. Usually I dont spend much time at home, but instead get out with my younger brother. I am fond of painting and building models and often spend hours at work making a model. out of cheap materials, such as paper, light wood etc. I am fond of football and often have a small game. I play the violin, but only as a hobby. I am often at the pictures, and concerts. Often I go away to see [football club] on Saturday afternoons. I also go to [football stadium], [football stadium], and sometimes [town] and [city] to see Scotland play.
      At home I am usualy either making a model, watching T.V. or sleeping. On the whole, I enjoy myself. Every week or so I look in all the advertisments for jobs, hoping to find one I fancy. I have not yet thought seriously about marriage. though I have a few girlfriends. I hope to find a job soon and settle down.  Words: 177
