I live in a house where there is a big garden which my children can play in. I like making things for my children and drawing with them, when I have the spare time. My job is being a hairdresser. I spend the money on the children for clothes, for our house and for spacial occations. I like looking after my dog and cat and watching them making friends. The children love playing with the dog and cat and also it keeps the children comany when I am out.  Words: 89
