This is a day of my life when I am 25 years old, I get up at six o'clack, I go to bed at Ten o'clack. When I get up I go to work, my work is a lorre diver sometimes I have to cian out my lorre. When I get home a 5 o'clack I have my tea, after I look at t.v. for a hour. Then I help my son to make a table. At nine I make sure the doors are shurt.  Words: 85
