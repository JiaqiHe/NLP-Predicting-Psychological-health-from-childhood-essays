I am an nun and I live in a convent it is hard very nice to be a nun. I am dress alover* in black and I have a black hair, I am looking and teaching* at a school. You sometimes have to go missions. When I was a nun I thought that I could not have children of my own but when you are a nun you can not have children. You would have to go to the missions.  Words: 80
