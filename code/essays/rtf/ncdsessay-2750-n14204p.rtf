I am working in the navy. When I am on leave. I go to see my wife and children. The next day I would go out in the car, with my wife and chidren. I would go to see my mother and father first. Then afterwards, I would go to see all my other freinds. Then when my time is up I would go back to the navy. The wages what I would get I would send to my wife with a letter. Telling her to put half in the bank, to save to go on holiday. When I had a lot of money in the bank. I would emigrate to canada with the wife and the children. When we would get there we would travel about around canada. Then we would settle down in a hold. Then I would get a job in canada. Then I would do what I did in England put half in a bank. When I have got enough money, I would by a flat. Then I would get my children a suitable school to go to. I would carry on working to save more money.
