When I grow up I think I will be a window cleaner. I will go to a good frim and when I am a expert at it I will make my own frim. I will have a few men, and they will be cleaning schools mostly. In my spare I will go to see my local team. I will collect stamps. I will get married at 21 and I will have three children. I hope I will have all boys and I will call them after my brothers [name], [name] and [name]. If I can I will get a big back garden. with a pond. I will have six failtails a terrypin, and I will have 8 big goldfish and six little goldfish.  Words: 123
