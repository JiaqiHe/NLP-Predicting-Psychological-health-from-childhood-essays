I am leading a very good life because I have so much to Do I get up at eight o'clock in the morning I go to the hospital to work I work in ward three it is very nice I am going on to do nursing because when the matron retires every body says I have a good chance of taking her place the work I Do is looking After Sick men and sometimes I am on night Duty So I Sleep for the day and go to the hospital at night At the moment we are living in [city I have a friend at the hospital called Susan She used to do the ward three with me but now she does ward four. We live in a flat my husband in the navy and as soon as we leave from [city] I am going to give up nursing. It is good fun at the hospital but sometimes it is very difficult now that I am a State Registered nurse I am going to Join him in the navy and be a nirse of the wren's because I like to travel a lot and see the world I hope to go to Australia and america. I have all ready seen these countrys of Europe and I have never been to America and Australia. One reason why I should not like to go to Africa very much is because I ran into a python there when I was about five. My mother was a State Registered nurse that is why I wanted to be a nurse.
