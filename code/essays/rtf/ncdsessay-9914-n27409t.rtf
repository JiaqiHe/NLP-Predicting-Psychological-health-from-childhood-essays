On my 25th birthday I would like a little puppy. I would have quite a lot of animales and breed some. I would like to have a pet shop of my own. My favourite animal is a horse my second is cats then dogs my third is things like mice, rats, Guinie-Pigs and Rabits. So in my pet-shop would be these kind of things and the food and bedding for them. On* Sundays I would go down and feed* them and clean them out and most probably play with them. I have always wanted a monkey so if I had enough money I would buy one for the shop and one for my own. If I could not do this sort of thing I would like to work in a zoo. I would not like to sweep round the zoo I would like to feed the animals or clean them out. Animals would be any* title* for nearly everything I have always loved animals and I would not marry a man who does not love animals I don't expect. I don't like the things like Painting or knitting and I would not like doing maths and things like that. I would like to have a dog that went nearly everywhere with me. If I could not do anything like that I would certainly have a pet dog or cat.  Words: 229
