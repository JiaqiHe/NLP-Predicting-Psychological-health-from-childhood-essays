My interests are boxing and I am a ameutor boxer. I am married with one girl and one boy. I go to a very good gymnasiam every Friday evenings. I also take my wife out very often with the kids. I will soon be a proffesional boxer so my boss says and I believe him. When I do have time off I usally read the paper and sometimes watch t.v. I have not wasted  one minute of my life it is very enjoyable and I hope it always shall be. I have also got a partime job at a zoo I love animals. I have three pets a mouse a cat and a fish. I tried breeding mice once before but the male got away. It is very difficult to breed cats especialy if you only have a male. My children are 9 years old they are twins and are both in the same class.  Words: 155
