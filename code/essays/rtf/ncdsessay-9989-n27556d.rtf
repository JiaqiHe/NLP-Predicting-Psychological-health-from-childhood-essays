Up at 7 o'clock in the morning nearly every day of the year getting ready for work. I have to get at the airport by half past seven to catch the aeroplane I pilot around the world stopping at different airports. I get one weekend out of three off and if to a wet weekend I read beside the fire and watch the television but if its fine I ride out into the country and fish but I have not caught one yet. Passenger aeroplanes are getting faster everyday and Concorde is not said to be very fast nowadays because other other airliners are taking over from it. When I do get a weekend off at the airline company I work for sometimes drop the crew off in a foreign country for the weekend. When I am at home I do my own cooking and when I am finished it takes me nearly a whole afternoon to get the kitchen clean again. But on Sundays I sometimes go to my Mam and Dads house for my dinner and sometimes after that I go and see my brother and his wife. In my spare time I have to make reports about the testing of planes. But testing in very exciting as you may no if you have seen on television.  Words: 219
