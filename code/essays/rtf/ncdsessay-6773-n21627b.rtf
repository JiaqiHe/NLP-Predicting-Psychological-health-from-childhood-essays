When I am twenty five I am either going to join the army or air force. If I joined the army I would like to be a general and lead a platoon of infantry in to battle in the dense jungles of the maylas. But if I am Going to join the air force I would like to be a squadron leader and fight the enemy aircrafts to protect my country, and then bome the enemys country until it surrenders, (unless we surrender first). I am not going to get marride becase I hate girls. when my mother and farther die I am leaving this country and emergrateing to Australia and join their army or airforce, and when I am a old man I will come back to this country.
