I have jsut turned 25, I have been working with the R.S.P.C.A. for six years now. I started to work with the R.S.P.C.A. because I love animal's, since I have been working with the R.S.P.C.A. I have had some expierencies. For instance last year a 9 month old pup was found at the bottom of an old well, the pup had broken 2 of it's legs, we managed to mend them, and we also found a new home for him. Mr [name] who finds homes for the animal's when they are'nt wanted. Had the expierence of bringing a family of eigth pup's, when the people who wanted lulu thier 4 year old rietriever destroyed, Mr [name] noticed that lulu was to be having pup's in a couple of week's, Mr [name] didn't have the heart to destroy her so he asked if he could have her and they agreed. and some weeks later Mr [name] had a lovely family of eigth pupies. now I will tell you a bit about my home life, I live a little house in birmingham. on saturday's and sunday's if it's nice we go visiting. In our family thier are 5, there's mum, dad, [name] my sister, [name] my brother and then there's me. all of our family likes horse riding we go during the week after tea. I think I am leading a happy life.  Words: 231
