Today is my birthday and I am 25 years old. And I have a knew job at the papermills. The time I have to go to my job is 7 o' clock and I have to get up very early in the morning. And we finish at 1/2 past 6 at night . At night I always go to my bed very early. In the morning I shall get up and make my dinner and then set off to my job. When i got to the papermills I put my bicycle in a shed and go in and set to work. In one hour I made 2,000 shots of papers. Now it is time for lunch hour I had a cup of tea and (*) six sandwiches with only one cup of tea . We only get 30 minutes for our lunch hour. Now we go to work and I made 4,000 sheets of paper. I am very glad for this is pay day today i got xxxx1.0.851/2 pence altogether .  Words: 171
