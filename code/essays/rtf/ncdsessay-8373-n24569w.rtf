I am in the Navy and I like working on the ships. it is my hobby sometimes when I go of stamp collecting. I have lots of shipmates, the one I like best is Captain [surname].
I am not on the sea, I am going to see if I can find the new German Submarine base so that we can stop them from Spy on us, SO when we got to Germany we split out into five groups of five. Almost an hour had gone and we was near but because we saw German Navy men so we carried on. at five past three and we had found it. and it was well comouflaged, we called out there it is so we went round it and found the opening, so three of us went in while the other two were on gaurd, so we set mines all over the Submarine base we set them for 5 oclock then they would go of, and blow it up so off we went and at five oclock we heard the explosion and we could see the flames so we ran back to the boat because we knew that aircraft would be over looking for us, so when we got back to the boat we looked around and we could see some aircraft so we set up the big guns ready for a battle, and the first fire or shot hit a German aircraft and it blew up, but then one of the planes dropted a bomb and mist us, and we had another shot and hit it and the other planes went back and so we had onse so we went back home and there was a big crowd but we had'nt got another vioage till a month, that was to take some people back to there countrys. that vioage was a good one because we had no fighting with other people of different countrys, but we did see some enemy aircraft and balloons.
