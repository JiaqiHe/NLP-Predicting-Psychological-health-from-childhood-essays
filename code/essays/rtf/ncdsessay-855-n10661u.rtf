----------------------
I still live with my parents but only during school holidays as I am a prep. school teacher. Out of school my interests are somewhat focused on collecting model Railways. I help my parents about the house and a lot in the garden as it is a hobby of mine. I've got a Land Rover and I like to keep it clean and make certain adjustments such as ext-ra seats and new upholstery. Also, during the Holid-ays I go camping.
Life at school is fairly well just routine with a fixed timetable for master and boys to stick to. I don't smoke cigarettes or cigars or pipes as I don`t think it is very wise to , many people think I must live a dull life but I don't think so.  Words: 130
