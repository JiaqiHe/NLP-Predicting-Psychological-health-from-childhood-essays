I am living in Liverpool. The house I am living in  is a modern house. I live with my wife [name]. Aftre work every evening I drive to the countryside with [name] and our dog 'Rin'. then* while [name] takes the dog along beside the beck for a walk I do a bit of fishing. At the weekend I go to the golf course. I come back at about 7.'oclock and at 8 o'clock I have a large supper. On the following Sunday I go to Church with [name] and my mother in law who lives 2 miles away In a cottage on the outskirts of Liverpool. Then she stays for Sunday dinner. On Monday It's back to work again. I work in a car factory. As the chasis' are hoisted up by a grab I fit the axles on. I work five hours a day. From Monday to Friday. Thursday is half day. In the factory its hot and smokey. The work isn't too hard and there is a good pay to look forward to. I've been at the job two years and find the job suites to me. For the Summer holidays we will be going to Ireland as we often do. we will take our car and the caravan by ferry. We find that Ireland is just right for people who are iritated by the noise and smoke of the large cities. It is the place where we can get away from it all. We usually spend two weeks there then go and see mother who lives near [town].  Words: 262
