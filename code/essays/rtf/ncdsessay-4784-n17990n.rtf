I left college at the age of twenty I am now working at the Computer Control and earn a very good wage. I am incharge of thirty* computers, and I soon hope to be incharge of the master computer, but I will have to pass the T.C.M.* (*Top computer man T.C.M.) test to reach that high post. Computer Control is situated on an astroid between Earth and Mars the astroid is controled by rocket moters linked to Computer Control. Living on Deltron, (the name of the atsroid), is quite simple we walk around as if we were on Earth although we are covered in by a huge dome, witch keep out gama rays etc. Our homes are full of comfortable furiture. When we want anything we just call a robot. The stafe on Delton must not be maryed or have any girl friends because all the staff are men. All I can say is that life one Delton it luxurious* and I will stay here, all my life.  Words: 168
