There was a pile of washing waiting to be done in the laundry basket waiting for me to wash. Oh how I wish I was young I thought to myself. Just as I had the water in the washer I heard my five month old baby crying in her pram outside. It was her bottle time I have to leave every thing to get her bottle ready. As soon a I had fed her my husband came home for his dinner. It had to be a ham (sand/samwhich) samwidgch today so I could get my washing done quicker. After dinner I started to do my washing again and managed to do most of my washing when a neighbour came for a cup of tea I felt like a cup my self so I made a cup for us. when the neighbour went I finished my washing. When I went up to make the beds I saw pile of washing on the bedroom chair I had just put the [illegible fiche] away so I was very annoyed and picked up the [illegible fiche] The washing will have to wait until tomorow I said to myself because the tea was still have to be done Soon we were sitting down to tea eating a cooked meal. After tea the day was not over there was the baby to put to bed and be bathed. There was also the washing to be ironed and many more things to be [illegible fiche] about twelve we went to bed. In the morning I was work all over again Oh I do wish I was still a school girl again, I thought to myself, but it never came true.  Words: 283
