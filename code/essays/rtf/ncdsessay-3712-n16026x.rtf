I live in (place) and work with the city police . I live in one of the flats on (place). The police are often called to go to car crashes, fires, burgularys and many other crimes. At home I do some odd Jobs around the house. Not long ago one block of flats near our home was demolished by fire. The fire broke out on the top flat. and spread through the building. Nobody was hurt but nothing in the flat could be saved. I am just back from a holiday in Malta, during the holiday I visited Cyprus , Italy , and Egypt.
In my spare time I play the violin at shows and clubs. A friend of mine owns a club in (place). Every Monday , Wednesday and saturday I go and play the violin at his club.
