Slowly I got up out of bed. I looked at my watch, which read eight o' clock. I was tempted to lie in bed for another ten minutes but a smell of bacon and eggs quickly dispelled that idea. I threw off the sheets and made my way to the bathroom. I had soon washed, dressed and had my breakfast. As I walked towards my car, a 1982 Austin Maxi, I began to think of going to work. I work at the [town] computed complex, which is approximateley to ten years old. The complex is situated at the opposite side of [town] from us. Sitting in my car I turn on the ignition and set off to work. Soon I reach the main gate where I give [name] my pass card. [name] is a friend of mine who went to school with me. Once inside everything is go. Everyone is feeding the computers with problems and facts. Feeding words into a computer is a very delicate business one wrong spelling and a computer could blow a fuse trying to answer the question. During the dinner break I usually meet a few friends whilst eating a concentrated lunch pill. since it is a friday I pick up my wages on my way home. During the weekend I go fishing or visiting relatives.  Words: 221
