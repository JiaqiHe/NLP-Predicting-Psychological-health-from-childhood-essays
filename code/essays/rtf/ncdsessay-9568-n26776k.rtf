I am 25 years old and I have two children a boy and a girl and I live in a little bungalo in the country. and my job is a nurse. and we have a car and I can drive so when I am on my way back from work I do some shopping and get the children some things. then when I get home I wash and iron all the cloths then get the children to bed then do some sewing. and Read the paper. then go to bed. and at week ends I take them to the swiming baths if I am not working. I take them shopping. and if it is very nice I take them for a picnic. and we have a big garden with a swing and a see-saw for the children to play on. and some friends for them to play with. and there is a park near by where they can go. and keep away from the roads. and when I get home at night from work there father gets there tea ready.
