----------------------
I am in the army and learning many things. I have not been married and have got many careers which I can do. I have been in for two years and have one more. I have made a very lot of friends and not very rich. My sister is married and so is my brother and both have children. I have learnt to fly a helecopter and have had my licence for one year. I have also learnt to live and I think it's very relaxing. When I leave the army I think I will go into the police force. I am hoping to get an office job or be a manger of a pop-group. or something like that. Tere* is a war between England and France and I have to go on a naval vessel. I am helping to cook in the galley I like cooking and do much of it. It will take only half an hour to get into France beacause we are flying. When we get there we have to attack a French base at a place in britanny.  Words: 183
