When I woke up I would go downstairs a few minutes after my wife, have brekfast and go to work. I would open the garage and get in my capri and drive away* to work. I would probably be working in a factory where they make machines. This is because I am intereseted in anything mechanical. I would probably of come out of the army a few years ago. My wages in the factory would be over twenty pounds a week. The machines made at the factory would be for the super sonic air liners wich will be able to over take the concord at a thousand miles per hour faster. When the day is over I would go home in my capri and lock up the garage. My wife would probably be a teacher. Or at least a student teacher. I would be in the Gilbert and Sullivan society because my mum and dad are in it at the moment. I would me musically minded for I play the Piano and Clarinet. My house would be fitted with many gadgets and the bed would swing up to the wall electronically and would serve as a mantle piece. One of my hobbies would be Model Railway Trains. I would have a fantastic collection. The model trains would probably not need rails because they would be on mono rails. Electricitty would be a thing of the past for trains. The scientists would have ivented some other thing to drive trains. All cars would be electicly driven. Robots would be on the  verge of success.  Words: 263
