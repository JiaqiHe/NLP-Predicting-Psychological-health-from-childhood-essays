When I leave school I would like to be an hairdresser.
But sometimes life gets interesting. and sometime browing.
I like seeing things and hearing things that are interesting, and I like reading interesting books.
I like reading books of pomes, and I like reading books of finding out things. 
My home life is sometimes happy but not all ways.
My Mother and father are very kind to me. I get just that little more then My brothers do.  Words: 75
