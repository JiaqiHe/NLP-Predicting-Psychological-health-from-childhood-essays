I am 25 years old and I have just left a collage which only deals with music. I am now a music teacher in a Grammar School in London. My wife and I live in the country in a large modern house. Music takes up most of my time but in the evening and on Saturday I am gardening because we have only been in the house six months and are garden is extremely large. I live thirty miles away from London and each morning and evening I make the journy into town and back. If I leave my house at 8.30 am. I get to my school which is on the outscurts of London at about 9.a.m. My wife is very good to me, when I get home in the evening she has a big dinner waiting for me in the dinning room.
