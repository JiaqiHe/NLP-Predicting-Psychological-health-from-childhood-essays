I am now 25 years old I have just finished at the acting school tomorrow I will be traveling to London for advanced training in acting for the play dreams of angels. I live in a country house just outside of London I am an actor and when I act in a play I earn 200 pounds a week. In the play Dreams of Angels I am a mad professor who invents a trumpet when blown it is capable of blowing a house down. I am interested in not only acting I am interested in Cricket, Teniss, golf and Football. I like going into a wood and watching Birds building nests and teach their young to fly. I also like watching deer drink and feed and watching badgers build their set. On a day of and it is raining I just sit and read a book. Sometimes on a night I study the stars through my telescope it has a special lens so that the vision is never blurrd. I have a morris traveler in wich I travel around England through a winter I have a ski holiday in Scotland the first time I tried out a pair of skis I broke my leg and had to stop acting for seven weeks and the director was very anorged because the reserve actor was nervous so the director said next time I was of as long as that again he would knock one hundred pounds off my pay.
