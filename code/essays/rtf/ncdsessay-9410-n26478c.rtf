"I am a teacher at a primary school. I teach a class of five to six year olds. I enjoy waching this age group much more than any other because they are beginning to learn things. I don't like to teach children who just start school because they just play and don't really do any work so I couldn't really teach them very much. I don't like teaching the top class of a primary school or any class of secondary age because they are getting more like adults than children.
I live in a house in the country. The village isn't exactly isolated but it isn't crowded and each house has a lot of garden and the houses aren't piled on top of each other like in some building sites.
I have a cat and a Spaniel. The cat is getting quite old but the Spaniel is only a puppy.
I have two small children, one girl and one boy They are called (name) and (name). They are twins and are two years old.
I teach older children how to play the recorder. I like to go for walks when I have time in the country.
I still have the same mynah bird that I had when I was eleven. He could only say ""is that right"" and (name) as well as imitate a few birds. Now he can say a lot more things, ** one has much time to teach him to say anything much but he picks things up as he hears them. After hearing (name), the Spanial bark so much he can now bark like him quite easily. This makes (name) a little confused.
All together I have a very happy and pleasing life."  Words: 281
