Every morning at half past seven I get up and prepare the breakfast before I dress and start collecting together the things that I need to use in the classroom I teach in a Junior School and I thoroughly enjoy it. Since I left college I have had lots of things to do at home and at work. For instance, when I first moved into this house the garden was a bit overgrown so I had a good job pulling out weeds and grass, digging and planting grass seeds for a lawn I had drawn a plan of what I wanted the garden to look like around the lawn I had planted some rose bushes with different coloured blooms Around the front of the house I planted daffodil bulbs, crocus bulbs and three clumps of dahlia. If I wasn't gardening or teaching I was either at the shops or in the house cleaning or wallpapering the rooms. Often i went into the next door neighbours house for tea and a chat There was always something to do and I have never been bored with anything. At night there is a cinema to go to and there is always a good film showing. I think that I am lucky to have such a good job and a nice home to live in  Words: 221
