"I climbed out of bed woundering what the day would bring, when and ear-splitting cry toled me that my baby was hungrey. I strolled over to her coat. She was rolling and smiling hopping to recive symth for keeping my up the previous night. I picked her up knowing she was a sorce of happience in my life. I glanzed at the alarm cloack which toled me I had over slept. I lay the baby down knowing their was not time to loss Then bruttely nojed my husbuns back from which he dived from under the sheets. ""What What"" he whalled woundering about what the comosion could be ""We have over slept"" He gulped and made his way to the wardrobe Wonce there he slipped into a suit, and orderred me to prpair his breakfest. I belt down stairs and prpared a plate of toast When he was down he dimmley looked at his breakfast woundering where his fri up was ""I have'nt any time darrling"" * ""I now what I cook you a tasty supper to make up for it"". Okay then see you this evening. Well with my husband at work and my daugther not whailling I flopped into an easy chair planing the meals for the rest of the week."  Words: 213
