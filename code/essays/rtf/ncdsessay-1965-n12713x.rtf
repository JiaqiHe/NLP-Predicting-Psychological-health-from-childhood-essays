Now I am 25. With a lot of house work to get on with. Then in half an hour I'm going to work. At 12 o'clock we have our lunchour. We go home at 4 o'clock. Which is in time to get my tea and go to the swimming pool in town for an hour. Then go home and get my husband's tea because he gets home at 6 o'clock. Then when he had had his tea he and I go the picturer's. Then we go home and have fish and chips for super. Then we do the wishing up. And in the morning that on Tuesday I have to do the Shopping.
