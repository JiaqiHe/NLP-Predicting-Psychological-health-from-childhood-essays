I think I will be a football player and travel all over the world and see new lands. I will see my old pals in Canada and I will play for Scotland and I will have a lot of friends I will have a lot of money. I might get marryed and in my time of I might go down to the beach for a day or two. I might go into towns or go sailing on boats I might play football three or four times a day and I might get a house in Aberdeen and stay there and I might buy a car and two or three children. I will have two boys and 1 girl I will have a washing machine and a dish washer in my house I will have the bedrooms up stairs and the bath room up stairs to. I will have a libary in the house and I might get two or three goals I might be a goaly.  Words: 166
