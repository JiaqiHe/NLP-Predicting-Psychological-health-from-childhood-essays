----------------------
I have an Enginearing job which sometimes takes me abroard.
I live in a flat in the outskirts of London where I still make modals out of balsa in my free time.
I live on my own, and in my room there are modal aircraf on display shelves, and hanging from the ceiling.
Among other things I still have my stamp collection which has grown appreicably since I was ten.
My job is interesting and I have an expenses paid holiday every year, somtimes I save up to add to this, and go to Spain for a change.
I use a Ford Escort as my means of getting to the office.
And when I go Abroad I take it with me. I keep it in a garage adjoining the flat, along with my 'home workshop', where I construct my modals.  Words: 134
