----------------------
I'm a journalist for the Daily Express and I get the same amount of wages as men. I live in [London borough] in a Georgian house. I'm married and have a baby called [female name]. I also write books, mainly trillers and murders. Before I get a permanent job I'd like to go round the world. After I'd been a journalist for about 1 year, then I'd like to get a shop. Top of the list (I mean of getting a shop) I'd like a bakers shop, next a pet shop, or even a miniture Sellfridges, or maybe an Antique shop. After I'd got a shop I'd like to get a job to do with television or radio. I might write script for a proggrame or even a film! When I'm a millionaire or nearly a millionaire I'd go globe-trotting. I've had a best-sellerbook called [surname]'s Investigation. I'm also a part-time teacher in a junior school in [London area].  Words: 159
