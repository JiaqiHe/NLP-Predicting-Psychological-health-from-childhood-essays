My job is thatching houses I work genrally in Hertfordshire and areas ar**nd here. I work in most wathers. I live in a thatched house just outside codicate and have a garden of one acre. I run a little antiques shop at cochcate which his a few intresting things in when I recive a letter to thatch a house it usually takes about one month for me to get the materials. And get time to do it I live in an crea were there is not much thatch so when I get a job I get a lot of money cg. xxxx200 for a medium size house and then anything upto xxxx1000 for a very big house. Thatching is very difficult you have to put the thatch down and then cover it with wire meth* to keep it down. It is very hard to put the mesh over because it is very big and it sratches and also you have to cut it which is very difficult. And also you se* a lot of people doing this job. My house is full of antiques old clocks chair instruments. I play the *elle in teh local orchestra I also play in the **** orchestra in my garden I have a big chalack with a set of tools and a lawn mower I sometimes draw and paint in water colours. My house is well set back.  Words: 234
