When I am twenty five I hope I will be livingin a little cottage in the country. I will have a dog wear ever I live or a cat. I hope to work in a zoo so I can be with animals. If I can't get a job their I will open my own pet store. I will have a horse so I can go out ridingevery day the dogs can follow behind I will learn to drive and get a land rover incace of emergances. To have all this I will need a lot of many I have got four pounds in my bank for when I grow up and I will have abuot 16 pounds when I am about. 18. If I have children they can help clean the animals when they are old enough. so I wont have all that much to do.  Words: 146
