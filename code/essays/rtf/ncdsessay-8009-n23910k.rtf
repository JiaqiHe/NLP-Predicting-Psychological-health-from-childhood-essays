At twenty five I would like to be in the army. From private I would like to be a captain to when I leave. I would to go abroad with the army and work. Then after a while I would like to save enough for my parents brothers and sisters to come abroad. Then I would like to buy a house for my mother and father and let them retire. At the age of fifty five I would like to retire and go and live in cornwall.  Words: 87
