----------------------
I am flying in the Royal Air Force in which I have my pilot's and passenger licence. I can fly many aircraft and helicopters. 
     I have a wife and three children the oldest being two and others are* twins of six months. I see quite a lot of my family as the station is fairly near out house. As a pstime I make models for show or operating. I have a garden with flowers and grass. My wife gives music lessons on the violin and also she makes cane-weaved baskets stools and flower-pot holders. We have a car and a small sailing dinghy and whenever we get the chance we go sailing either on a river or the sea. Each summer we usually have about a fortnight staying in a cottage by the sea with the children. 
     At home we lead a normal life except for the fact that I am away a lot due to Air Force activities, but what ever time I do get at home I spend either diggin the garden or sitting in the sun in a deck chair watching aeroplanes or spending the time inside the house making models of ships and other things. I lead a fairly normal life at home apart from my Airforce duties.  Words: 214
