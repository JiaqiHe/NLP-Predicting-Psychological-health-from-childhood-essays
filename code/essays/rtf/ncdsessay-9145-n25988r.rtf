I am 25 years old and living in London. I would like to move but I am saving up to go to Africa and America. so I only keep enough to pay my rent and get food. I earn money by helping a vet who has just set up a sugery in [town]. My landlady is vey kind and doesn't get to cross when I come in late and she has to unlock the door. I have a handsome young boyfirend who has a boat on the Thames in which we go sailing. I have many pets... an alation, a few goldfish, a Siamese cat, an aviary of huming birds and a parrot. It costs alot to feed them all. One day while I was at work, an old woman came into the waiting room with a large basket. In it was a cat called Victor. He was very fat and the woman did not know what to do with him. It turned out that hee was a her about to have kittens!
I may get married soon, I don't know.  Words: 180
