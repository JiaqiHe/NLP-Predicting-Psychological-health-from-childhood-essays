At the age of twenty-five I have now reached my life-long ambition, I am in the R.A.F. I am the pilot of a single-seater hawker-harrier jump-jet. I have recently been promoted to wing-commander, of 326 squadron based at Hamilton Bermuda.

When I woke up this morning there was C.O. standing in the doorway, he told me I had to fly with the rest of my squadron out to a small village called Kilpoms to help the army in a battle with enemy terrorists who had taken the village guards by surprise, but had not succeeded in capturing the village. Instead they encircled the village with troops and guns. When we got there we had to use cannon and machine-gun fire to drive them away. A week later I was reading a letter which told me that I was being transfered to an old airfield out-side Glasgow. I was very-pleas because I would be able to try and get a place in Glasgow Rangers, the team I had followed since I was a boy. I would of course only be allowed to play in my spare time. During some of my spare time I made small radio sets and model aircraft which fly.  Words: 201
