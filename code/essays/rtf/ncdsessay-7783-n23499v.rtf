"When I am twenty-five I hope to be a doctor or lawyer or something like that. I am interested in law and chemistry. Just now I live in a small bungalow in the country as I am not married. Every night when i come in my tea is ready. It is made by my mother who lives with me. My father died three years ago so my mother came to live with me. I travell ten miles every day to my work in my Zephyr 6. I live in (place) at a place called (place). In my house I have a carpenter's shop as I am fond of woodwork. at the back of the house I have a* garage big enough for two cars. at the back of that I have a tool shed in which I keep a few tools like a **** a *** and lawn mower. The rooms in my house are as follows a kitchen a bathroom, two bedrooms, a dining room and a living room. My mother came from (place) to (place). Last night I cleared out the attic and I found a old hair of very valuble rosary with medals dating back to 1037 . I know because I tooks them to a specialist. I find plenty of things in attic and my mother always says ""You are awful silly picking up dirty things."" But I just don`t say anything."  Words: 236
