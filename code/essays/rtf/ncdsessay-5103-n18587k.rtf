When I am twenty-five years old I will be married and have two children. but I will still have a job as a teacher and P E instructor. My mother will after my children. My children will have some pets such as cats or dogs to keep them amused. In the evening I will cook some food for my family. We would live in the country but it would be near a town. Every Saturday I would go into town and buy some food and maybe a toy or two. I would have a car. I should think that it would be a Ford Cortina. My husband would be a Royal Marine and would have black hair. He would be one or two years older than me. He would be more than five feet ten inches high. Every Sunday we would go for a try around the lanes and roads. My intrests would be dancing and watching ice skating. I would try to give my children a few things but I would not spoil them. About once a month my husband and I would go out, again my mother would look after them. My mother and Father would live with us. My father would probaly be retired but would not stop doing odd jobs around the house. I would get up about seven o'clock so I I could do my housework and get the things I needed for school ready. I would teach the top class. Every day of the week the children in the top class would have arithemetic from then to half past ten. We would live at the top of the hill in among some trees.
