I am trying my very best now on my second story and hopping it will be even more of a sucsess then my first which was published a year ago. I still live with my mother and father and never intend to get married because I hate housework. Of corse I must have another job for if my stories are not succesful and that is a typest in the main offices of [company name]. I run a dark blue Cortina to get backwards and forwards to work in and it comes in handy If Mum and Dad wants to have a day out. I like to visit many places abroad and have already been to America and Spain. This year Mum Dad and I are going to Australia for 2 months by plane. I have hundreds of sillvonias from these two trips. Many are also sent by pen friends in New Zealand, Portugel, Africa and Mexico. I always like to be tastefully dressed and wear my hair long. In my spare time I look after my sister and bother's children while they go out. and  Words: 185
