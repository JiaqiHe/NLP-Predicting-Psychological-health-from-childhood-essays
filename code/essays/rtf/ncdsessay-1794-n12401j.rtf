My job is a teacher and I am getting on qiute well. Now and again I get very frustrated and loose my temper. I am married and my home life is struggling slong. I sometimes get left behind in my house job*s which we difficult to cope with my interest's are mostly finding more about nature and also going yachting. The life I am leading is very good for a start and sorr I hope it wil make even more progress. My class of pupils are getting along with me fine. The staff are kind and willing to help me in any troubles. I am very pleased with all the furniture I have at home. I get worried if thing's do not go right. I am a science teacher what I have always wanted to be I have no children yet. But when I get older I do want some. We have one dog and a hamster which I love dearly. I go to collage once a week.
