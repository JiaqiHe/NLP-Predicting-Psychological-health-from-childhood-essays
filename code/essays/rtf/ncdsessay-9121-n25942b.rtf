I am now a nurse. I left college five years ago, an SRN. I live a few streets away from the the hospital whith my husband & child Although I have a job, I still find plenty of time to read, clean the house and look after my daughter who starts school in two days' time. Being an SRN, I work a 48 hour week, with any overtime when its necessary. Sometimes I work night some weeks. and its a little odd to have my supper at 9 in the night. I hope to soon become a staff nurse. It might mean more hours work but that doesn't matter.  Words: 109
