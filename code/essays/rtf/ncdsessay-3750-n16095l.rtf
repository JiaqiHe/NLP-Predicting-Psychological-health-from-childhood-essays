I am now 25 and I am a policeman I live in a house on the door it says police they put it on the door to show people that a police man lives there. I direct the traffic and I some times go on a night shift and I do not like it. but I have to do it wether I like it or not. I have  to sometimes go to another twon to arrest crooks or bad me I even have to fight some because they struggle and kick it does'nt do them much good because there is more than us. we have a holiday and we can go away but we cannot stay very long we could not stay over a week when we come back we have to start work all over again but we may get over work and we get more money our house is nice we have 3 bedrooms and we have two children I* have a toilet up stairs down stairs and one out-side we also have a big garden it has a lawn and it has a pond with a mill and we have little dwarfs once I was eating my tea and a man came running round ours he said there has been a acciddent so I ran out and a little girl was trapped in a lorry was on fire so I went up to the lorry and said stand back and every body back I opened the lorry door and the I went in first I pick up the fire applance and I pull out the button it started to shoot every where and I pulled the little girl out and took her home and put her to bed by this time the ambulance was out side our house and he took the little girl to the ambulance next day the ser gent gave me a badge and it said on it fire helper I was gratefull and teh sergent put me in a car and I never had to go on nig shifts or direct traffic of and my wife and I lived happily ever after  Words: 359
