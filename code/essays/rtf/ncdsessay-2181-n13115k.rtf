I am 25 years old and I am working at the Cinema. Wen I get up in the morning I go a cross to the Cinema. Wen I am at the Cinema I get the fillam ready for the peple in the Cinema after that I go home for my tea. After I have had my tea I go to the club with my frend and wen the club shuts we tack our dogs out for a run in the Street and After that We go home and to bed.  Words: 90
