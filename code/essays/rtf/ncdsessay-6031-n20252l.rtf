I am a secretary at a London office. My home is small but pretty. I work for three days a week. It is quite an easy job and not to boring. For the rest of the week I don't do very much. I do my housework, listen to the radio, watch television and read for a lot of the time. I earn between xxxx6 and xxxx8 a week. My day starts at half past seven when I must rush for an early bus to the centre of London. I work until eleven, then I have a break. From eleven I work till 1o'clock, have lunch and then go on again to 6o'clock. I go to some night clubs, but most evenings I stay at home. I don't visit many friends as they all live along way away. 
In my holiday I go to Dartmoor and do fishing. I don't catch much but there is always a chance. I also walk on the moon quite a lot, this is mostly rear the moonland streams. On other holidays I go to Westward Ho. It is a seaside resort. The beach is lovely, and I like to swim there. I like go to [town] quay also.
During some weekends I visit my mother and father in [town]. I always look forward to going home after a holiday.
I am not married. Sometimes I think I would like to live in Norway. This is because of the scenery there, it is lovely I think. 
My life isn't very interesting but I like it!  Words: 257
