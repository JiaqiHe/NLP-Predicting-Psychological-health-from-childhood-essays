I am married and have a family of two. I have got a job. While I go to work I leave my children with a home help. My job is a short hand typist. I earn twenty pounds a week. My hours a day are ten till six. At night when I come home from work I cook supper for my home help and myself. My husband works in Liverpool so I don't see as much as I should. The life I am leading I think is a very happy life because I am a*h to so many parties and weddings and if its one thing I like* is a party.  Words: 111
