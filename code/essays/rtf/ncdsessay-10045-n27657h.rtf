"I am now twenty five. I am a married woman and I have two girls, named [name] and [name]. My home life is interesting because I have a puppy named Lisa. and so I am occupied for half the day, because I am a teacher. I teach children under five. because i think that children under five are much more interesting than Juniors.
Before I was twenty five I was a nurse. I was nursing at [hospital], for children This was very interesting because I watched other nurses doing injections, operating on people and plenty of other things to do, like, changing nappies. making beds. preparing food for children. Once I was a night nurse, it was rather horrifying at first, because a child kept crying and crying so - I called the matron to looked at her. She said ""The child has a bad stomach pain on her right side, she ought to be operated at once or she will died"". This was a very horrifing experience for me because I have not operated on any on. So matron and I operatied on this poor child. I gave her a sleeping injection. So she would go sleep. Soon it was all over, Matron and I put her in bed and she woke up."  Words: 213
