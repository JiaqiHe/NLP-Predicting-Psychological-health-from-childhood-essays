I live in a flat in London with my husband who is training to be a full time doctor I am twenty five years of age I have no children so I too work, I work in the hospital looking after the childrens ward it is a very nice job has I like children. I have no time for hobbies as I am at work on shifts and then when I come home I have to work cleaning the flat up, I sometimes pop out to the shops for food and when I am on holiday I have my little niece stay with me We sometimes go for long dives in the country. But sometimes when my husband and I have a holiday we go to a holiday camp and we enjoy ourselves when I was younger I used to love going on holiday and I still do. I don't eat as much sweet stuff as I used to. My hair as gone a funny brown colour and I am more serious than I used to be but I can have a good laugh. I have a bird called Joey who I am trying to learn to speak. I like London but I'd rather live in Yorkshire any day.  Words: 209
