----------------------
I am 25 years old and I teach in a local primary school. Every morning at half past eight I ride my scooter to the school. In the evenings I bring home book to mark and they take half the evening to do. I share a flat with a friend and we sometimes go out together. In my spare time I go swimming which I do quite a lot of or else go to the church choir. 
In the holidays I usually go to my parents home where my two sisters live as well. I go out with an old friend to the pictures or to clubs so that I do not get too bored. I was born in Guernsey and my parents live there. 
I like reading and usually do it in the evenings or in the lunch hour. My friend who I share the flat with works at the same school as I, but I work in the infant department and she in the junior department. If I could chose which part of the world I would go to I'd say Switzerland or Italy. These two places I like to go because I want to go sking and I want to see the wonderful sights. 
I like music and listen to it every day. Art I like especially painting though I am not that good at it. If I were not a teacher I would like to be a secratary. I would like to be a secratary because I like doing paper work.  Words: 255
