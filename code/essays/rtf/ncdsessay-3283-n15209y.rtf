When Iam 25 I would like to be married but not have any children till I'm about 30, I would go out to work so we could save up for a house of our own. But before we could have a house, I would like a flat. Then we could move into the country. I would like a car of our own but if we could afford one each I would have a mini a red one, but I dont know what my husband would like. Later on if we have children I would like just two I dont mind if I have 1 girl & 1 boy or two girls but I wouldn't like two boys. When I go out to work I would like to work in a shop a grocers or a sweet shop I don't mind. I wouldn't like an office job or a job in a shoe shop it would be to boring. I would like to do my own coocking and housework. I wouldnt like to live to far out in the country I'd like to live near some shops or just outside a town. I would like to have smart clothes but not too short. I like gardening so I would keep our garden nice if we have one. And also our house I would keep tidy. I would like to have a big kitchen with all its accesories so that I could do a lot of cooking. I wouldn't like our house to big but a decent size.  Words: 256
