The Life I would like to lead when I am 25 yrs of age is to be an interesting one. I would marry a man and have two children. I would like to call the children [male name] and [male name]. I would get a car but I don't know what sort yet. I would take the children places in it. My interests would be stamp collecting and enjoying the out of doors. I would like my children to go to school at the age of five. My husband would get a good job somewhere, and when the children are at school I might get a job. When I am older I would like to take shorthand. classes. I might like to live in Ireland but I am not sure. My home life would be a pleasant one I think. I could go shopping some days and then make some dinner for the children. After dinner I would send them of to school again. In the mornings I would have to sweep up and make the beds. On a Saturday or Sunday I would take the children and my husband to the park, if it was a nice day. Sunday morning the children would go to church with my husband and I. That would just about be the end of one week. I would like my husband to get a job that would suite him. When I am 25 yrs I would also keep up playing the piano and any other instuments I had learnt to play when I was younger. I would also like both my children to learn to play some kind of instrument when they are still at school.  Words: 282
