I would like to do something to do with animals like helping a vet in a surgery or be a vet. If I didn't do that I would like to help you children that connot walk. Before I would do that I would stay on a extra two years and school studying about it and getting my o and a levels. I would like on up to date room flowered wall paper. Friend in and would go out with themto dances meet boys. I would have some animals such as dogs. i would help mum in the house and wear up to date cloths. About this time I would be about * the age of marrying. I would like two or three children and would like to live abroad in Australia or Canada. I would still keep me job but 'just part time. I would make sure my children had good education and we would have a boat to go out in every week ends if I could I would like to visit the world such as swissaland because I would like to go skiing. I would keep my hair in exellent cond**on and have very expensive clothes. The man I would marry would have to like children. I would wear make up but it would only be very light I would have a pretty pink lip stick. and blue eye shadow. I would like two boys & one boy they would always be treated the same way and would have plenty of toys to play with. If I could I would like my children to be good at sports and would take them to the swimming bath a lot.  Words: 280
