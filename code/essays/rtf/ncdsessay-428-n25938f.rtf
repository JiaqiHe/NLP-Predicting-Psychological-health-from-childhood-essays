On a Saturday night I go out for a drink. When its Sunday I go to the shore if it is sunny. I was at Ayr last Sunday. I was just about to go out this Sunday when it started to rain.

After a little while I went down to the sand and sat there for another hour. I went in the water for a little while for a swim. After I got dried and got my cloth on it was about six o'clock. Before I went in my [illegible] I bought something for eating going up in the car.  Words: 235
