"The year is 1983, my birthday was a week ago & I had a hover-car from my rich Aunt. I ama comandor in the navy, they have Just asked me if I'd be the comandor of an underwater exploration team 22 miles under the sea. My wife and I were planning a holiday on the moon. The only trouble is, my wife had said, 'If ever you wanted to go anywhere you had to go through those horrible glass tunnels and Junior (our Baby) I won't like that at all"". At home in Klarl Lane we live in a 130 story flat. We've a heated chair and sofa. Each person has got a lif o0f their own which leads from our garage to our apartment. 
It's a pity really there are no more trees any more like there were when I was a boy. It's all houses and flats. We've got a robot to do most of the work, but its still as much hard work to programme the thing."  Words: 170
