My name is (name) I am 25 years old I have a job as a swimming teacher . All day long a teach swimming lessons and at nights I sometimes go to movies or to the dancing. I also love animals very much and I take my pet dog out for a walk every night . Sometimes if I do not go out anywhere I just lie down and watch TV. During my spare time I go to the swiming baths and swim about by myself. In my spare time I do not always do this most of the time I help my mother* to do the work . I do not bother about boys very much. I start my work at 8 (o) clock in the morning and finish at 7 (o) clock at night I enjoy doing my work very much and I hope to reach the olimpics myself . On Sundays I do not work I go and ride away into the hills . At first I could not ride a horse then I get lessons and I can ride just as well as I can swim.  Words: 190
