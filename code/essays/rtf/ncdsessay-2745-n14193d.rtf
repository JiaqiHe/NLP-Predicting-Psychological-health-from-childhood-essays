I work in a shop which is in london I live by that one shop It opens every day at 9'o clock. The staff have to be there for 8.45pm. to clean the counters and take off covers over the modle's. Out of working hours I help with local rumage sales etc. I have a flat which I share with my friend. We are both keen riders so we go riding. My home life is not interesting, I just read and do many other things. Yet in the shop it's the same all the time. Only you met Knew people all the time. Whenever there are holiday's I go to see my mother who lives by the sea. My friend will often give me posters to paint. I never see my father, he was Killed in a car crash 2 years ago. My brother is nearly always away overseas in the army. Sometimes I go aboard with Mrs [name] the person in charge of our department.  Words: 166
