I get up Every morning at eight I have a shave Then off to work. I am a director The big firm off [company] I have a lot of paperwork to do like making out bills. writing cheques. seeing to orders and looking at the drapery that we produce it has to be checked carefully to see if their are faults in it. then I have to go to board meetings then I go home I do the garden. I have many such interests. I like making models especially areoplanes and ships the detail fascinates me Then I love watching motor racing on the telivision and scrambling my life at is a very pleasant one indeed I have all the neccesities of life with my houskeeper she makes very nice meals and a lovely sheperds pie. Then I usually sit down in the easy chair pick up a paper and read then perhaps I may Go out some where when I come back I switch the telivision on for a while and Eat my supper then I study all the contracts for the next days meetings and go to bed and read for a while then I finish any models I have not finished Then I switch off the light and go to sleep  Words: 214
