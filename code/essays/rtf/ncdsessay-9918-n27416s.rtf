I am twenty five years of age and I am a teacher at [school]. My class is J.1 J. and there is 39 children in my class I thoroughly enjoy being a teacher  But I have trained for a very long time. At home I have two sisters and one brother. One of my sisters name's is [name] who is three years younger than me and she is 22 years of age I have another sister who is 8 years younger than me and is 17 years old, and last of all is my little brother who is 15 years of age. Here are three of my favourite hobbies, Swimming, Needlework and Sport. I also enjoy going to the cinema and watching horror films. 
When I am about Thirty I might retire from being a teacher, and maybe be a typist.  One of my favourite hobbies at home are reading and writing and some times writing play for the children in my class. 
I enjoy my life now but I don't know what my future will be like.  Words: 178
