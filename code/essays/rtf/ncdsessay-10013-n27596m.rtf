I am in the army driving a cheiften tank into battle. I am leading an ordinary life in the Army. My Interests are snooker and gymnastics. I have a very good friend in the Army. I live in a hut and It is about 50 feet long with all my mates. I have 5 weeks leave soon and I go home to my wife. While I am on leave I go to the pub with my wife and have a drink. We go out to dinner to an Italian Restaurant in Northampten. After five weeks Have gone I go to my Army destination in India. When I get to it I relax for 2 hours and start training again. We have to get all the light out at 11 o'clock sharp or the Sergant will be angey. In the morning out to battle at 5 'o'clock a.m While were are battliaing* we capture a town off India's capital city. I and my tank and crew are left behind to sort out the captives. As we look behind we find out tank is in flames, so we put it out with foam. For two hours We battle with the captives, and at last we take them back to be torchered. 3 months later we have caught another town in India*. I have a day of relaxasion on Sundays. As I have my tank serviced* I have a small nap.  Words: 238
