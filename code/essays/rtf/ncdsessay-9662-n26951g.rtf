Today it was my 1st Annaverary we were selabrating it. We had invited our friends to come. We had two children and they were there in thier best frocks. We were married four years ago and today we were selabrating. When we got married we went and got married in a church. I had a job it was a short hand tipist in my boss'y office he said I could have today off because it was my 25th Annaverary and he gave me a bunch of flowers. At the party we had about 20 people and you should of heard the noise it was dreadful. Most people had a drink before they sat down to eat. The children which they had brought with them wanted ice cream so we went and had to buy some ice cream but only a small one for the children because the grown ups did't want any. About twelve of them was my relations but they did't bring thier children they left them home with some friends. Most people was waiting for the spearil cake which I had made. We did't sart eating until five a clock because they wanted to talk about because we were waiting for the time to say eight at i clock because that was when they were going home. My husband job was a building job and he like it because you have got some one to talk to but when he's at home he has't got anybody to talk to because I busy cooking or doing the washing or getting dinner and tea. When my husband and I go to work we take the two girls to my mother to look after.  Words: 283
