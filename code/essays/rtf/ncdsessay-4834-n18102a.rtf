My name is [male name] [surname]. I work at Bristls zoo, my job is to feed the Grey kangroo. Its food its one and a half cabbages and one and three quarters of oats twice every day. The first day I cam I was scared stiff, but after a few days I got used to it and I became the kangaroos best friend. One day I heard that the kangroo had to be moved in the next three days so that day I thought what sort of an animal would be in its place. The third day came and I was still wondering what sort of an animal would be in its place, but I diddent have to wonder any more because I found out that the kangroo was only Going to be moved six or seven cages away.
after about a year with Grey kangroo I moved on to the Indian Elephents but I diddent have to feed them I had to clean their cage out.  Words: 166
