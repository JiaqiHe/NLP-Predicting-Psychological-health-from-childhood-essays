I am now 25 and have a job as a motor machanic in a big garge. I have half day wednesday which I spend making up cars on paper and building them. I often spend hours in the garage at home I am making a car for the conditions found in the Antarctic. At six in the mourning I am ready for work at the garage. Today we are going to service a caterpillar tractors motor Ron our Director uses the coaling crane to life the motor onto a steel works cradle by midday the motor is striped right down for the overhaule the next day we put it back in the tractor and tune it. Then with a finale look over the tractor to started and reversed onto a waiting lorry.  Words: 132
