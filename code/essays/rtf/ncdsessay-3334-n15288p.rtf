It was my day off from work. So I laid in bed till eight fifteen. I ***ld not lay in any longer because my children had to get of to school. They were both in the infants. I have two girls. One just five and the other is nearly seven, and going into the junior school in September. Their names were [name] and [name]. [name] was the youngest. My husband is just twenty seven. His name is [name].
      I got up rather reluctantly. Got washed and dressed. I then went downstairs to get the breakfast. My husband hardly had time to eat because he had to rush of to work. Luckily the school was only round the corner. The children enjoy school very much.
      My job is a secretary. My boss is nice, but keeps me busy. He is a middle aged man of about thirty seven or thirty eight. I enjoy working for him very much. HIs name is Mr [name]. and he is the manager of a branch of [company]. The make cameras and things like that. and so natrually both husband and I have [company] cameras.
      My hobbies, (not that I have much time for that sort of thing) are oil painting, which I do in the evenings when the children are in bed, so that then nothing gets spilt or spoilt, and reading.
      There is always a lot of house work because the children are so young and messy. They always make their clothes dirty at school. and a clean table clothe never stays clean for long.  Words: 261
