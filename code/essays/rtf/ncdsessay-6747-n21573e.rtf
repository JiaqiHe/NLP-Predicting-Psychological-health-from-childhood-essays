I am [male name] [surname]. I am 25 years old. The kind of life I have now is a good enjoyable worthwhile life. I am an Electrician and outside my working hours I play soccer and rugby. Other times I go swimming and to Judo classes. My home life is with my mother and father. I have got no wife yet. In my spare time on sundays I spend my time on radar. Reading books and learning how radar works. Other times I read books of Archaeology finds. Some times I go looking for Ancient things. Sometimes I will watch tellevision help my mum with odd jobs around the house. After a few years as an Electrician I will learn all I can about Archaeology and I think I will become an Archaeologist of course I will have to learn a lot about earths long past history. I will learn how to preserve them because when exposed to air. It will probably dissolve into dust. I will have to pass a lot of exams while Im still in university. I will able to go to Arcgaeologists digs to learn more about Archaeology. If I do become an Archaeologist like to go to Egypt because I have read stories about these pyramids. And I hope I will be able to find a find like Tutankamen.  Words: 224
