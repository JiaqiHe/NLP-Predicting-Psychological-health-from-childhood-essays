I will not getting married.
I am live with my mum.
My mum age is 95.
I am 25 year old.

I am in the air force.
I am flying the concorde.
It can cary 250 pelple.
In the afternoon I do gardening.

In the summer I goes swimming with my pal.
We dive us the diving bord.
We can swim under water.
We are champion swimer.  Words: 56
