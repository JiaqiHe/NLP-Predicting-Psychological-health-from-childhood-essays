I am now what I wanted to be when I was young a professional footballer playing for a great team who had won the European Cup a year beforehand and now well clear at the top of the league At the end of a match I used to go home to be greeted by my wife. Besides being a footballer I was a manager of a store. This was part-time of course we did our training for the team on Sundays, Tuesdays, Fridays and playing on the Saturday. I lived in a house in the country where it was lovely. I drove to work through a lane onto the main road and you just keep going until you come to this town. Beside our there was Golf course where sometimes our team play matches by themselves. I was runner-up in a tournament we made up called Players-Golf Tournament. I like of course football and golf but I am also interested in a game called basket-ball. Our training for the team is all day starting on Sundays begin at the ground at 9 o'clock and we have a dinner-break at the canteen but our break lasted an hour.  Words: 197
