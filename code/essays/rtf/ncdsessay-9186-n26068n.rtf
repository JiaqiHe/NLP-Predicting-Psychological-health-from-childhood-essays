If I was at the age of 25 I would be a ballerina or a gymnastic at acrubats. I would get married to a handsome rich man, and have two children. When I was married I go abroad by plane to Australia. I'd name my children (BOY AND GIRL) [male name] and [female name]. If I was very sucessful at dancing I'd dance round the world. When my children grow up I will teach then to dance.  Words: 77
