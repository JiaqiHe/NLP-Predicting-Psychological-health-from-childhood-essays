My name is [male name] [surname] and I am a pilot and I fligh planes all over the world. I live in a small house beside Prestwick airport I live a happy life and my hobby is golf I play it neally every Thursday which is my day off. I like flying planes but it can be a dangerous job landing is the worst part if you crash the plane could blow up. I remember one night it was so fogy that we couldent see the run way and we were running out on fuel and we had to land soon so I circled and went down suddenly I found that we mist the runway and had landed in a feild then I saw a fence ahead and I did'nt have time to pull up so I made a sharp turn to the right and one of the wheels gave way so that was one wing down and that slowed the plane down. Then the wing banged into a buulder and the plane suddenly stopped all a passengers were shaken up but none were injured the sweat was pooring out of me. Then we had to get the passengers to safty I shall never forget that time since then nothing has happened.  Words: 212
