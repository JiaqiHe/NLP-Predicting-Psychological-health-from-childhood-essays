When I am 25 I want to be a pilot for BKS flying from Newcastle. I will be interested in sport and traveling round the world. I will have a deatatched Dutch bungalow for my mam dad and family. I will have a Rover and a Triumph car &* my own 12 seater plane. I will take my family on holiday with me abroad. I will take my mam to London for weekends to go shopping at Oxford Street or somwhere like that.  If I do not become a pilot I will try for engineering and buy a petrol staition ar a removell service.  Words: 104
