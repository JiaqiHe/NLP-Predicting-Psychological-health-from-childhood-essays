I will live in a nice little cottage not to big and not to small, and I will own a shop it will exist of grocerys, sweets and parrifin. i will buy a horse to go out riding in the country and a stable and a large padock for it to live in and if I have enough money I will buy two ponies for my children they are about five years of age and I will name them [name] and [name]. They wiil be nice and brown and healthy children. My husband [name] will work in the shop as well, he is handsome with fair hair and nice and strong. I am living in Geraldton in the West of Australia. The country is lovely down there and me and my famiely go and beath down in the sea every Saturday and Wednesday. My children go to school and each morning at quarter to eight the school bus comes and picks them up and they return at half past three. Australia is a beautiful country and I am glad I went there.
