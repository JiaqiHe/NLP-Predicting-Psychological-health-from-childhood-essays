----------------------
I am 25 years old and I stamp collect, and my job is a trainer for a football team. I am not married and I am not courting. I live in a terraced house with my parents near [town]. Life is not boring as Monday to Friday I go and train our team, [football club] for every Saturdays match, and sometimes mid-week matches. In my spare-time I am mostly on the look-out for new stamps. On Saturdays I am at the touch-line at the match, and in the mid-week matches. We are quite a good team. We are in Division One and usually finish about 3rd or 4th I go to the ground in my car, a Morris-Mini Minor.
      I have got 5,825 stamps at the moment and I am always buying new issues almost the days they come out.
      The football team doesn't train as often in the summer. but nearly every summer term we go on a tour to a foreign countery. I go with them every time they go.
      On Sundays I usually help my parents doing odd jobs around the house.  Words: 185
