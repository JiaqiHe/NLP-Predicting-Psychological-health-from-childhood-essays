My work is a nuress and I enjoy it very much. I always help my mother at home, and cook the meals for her, and make the beds, so she can go on holidays and go out to parties and I would let her have her breakfast in bed and I would get it for her.
I alwyas have a ride a day and exersize my pony and clean it out. When it is a nice hot day I would go down to the sea wall and have a swim and get a picnic ready for my mother and farther. When my farther is on a contin I would alwyas get his lunch ready for when he comes in late. 
When I am a nurss I would be in [hospital name] Hosiptial in London and when I could come home I would always come and look after my parents. I would give them a rest from the hard work, of tiding up the house.
I would go out to parties and take my parents and may be iff my brother was there I would take them to a theater.  Words: 187
