Just now I am in an apprentice ship to be a chemist It is quite dangerous working with the chemicals. I live in a bungalow in [town]. Every morning I take the train to the centre of glasgow it is 20 minutes to arrive there. When I am home my hobbies are swimming, fishing, and tennis. I have two cars at my home one is a jaguar mark 10 which is my fathers and a rover 2,000. The rover is a bottle green shade. The rover is streamlined which means aerodynamic. My jaguar mark 10 has got quite a few gadgets for one cigarette lighter and many others. I have quite a happy life just now and a good mother and father  Words: 122
