I am now 25 years of age. My home is a flat in London. I am training to be a shorthand typist at a collage nearby New* to my flat is a large swimming pool where I go just about every week (swimming ** about my favourite hobby) Every week I go home to see my family. Although I'm training to be a typist I hope to be a champion swimmer one day. The collage where I train is very large. It has lots of corridors and rooms that sometimes I g***d best My lessons begin a 9'oclock the first one is in room 10 and a lot of others are too I walk home to my feat (which is on the third floor) and get home round about 4.30. I then make myself some tea and get ready to go to the swimming baths. My friend comes for me at 6.30 and we make our way to the swimming baths. We change and by the time we get in its seven o'clock. At eight the whistle blows and we get changed and go home where we make our-selves support. Another hobby of my is going to the pictures. We go (my friend and I) about once every week. Usually the film starts at 7.30 so we set off at 7. o clock. By the time we get there its quarter past seven so we've just sit down before the film starts. On Sunday I go to see my family. I drive down in my car in the afternoon and stay till 8 o clock or lates. Nothing very exciting happens really but I enjoy staying here. in London.  Words: 279
