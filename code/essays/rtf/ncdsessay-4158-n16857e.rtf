My name is [name] and I am not yet married. I live in a modern bungalow. I am a teacher in primary school I leave home at quarter to nine and arrive at the school at nine o'clock. After assembly, the  children I teach go into the class-room. I teach ten to eleven year olds. They should be sitting down quietly when I come into the class-room. But they rarely are. On Monday mornings untill quarter eleven the children do maths They ask me many questions about the maths and I should know the answers. I don't tell the children the answers but I help them to understand the questions. 
      We have break at a quarter to eleven. I then go to the staff room and enjoy a cup of tea. The rest of the day goes on and at a quarter to four we go home. 
      In my spare time I watch the television. I like drawing very much and also in my spare time I draw. I go to a youth club on Saturday afternoons. There I meet my friends. In the evinings I go to my friends house or they come to mine. I enjoy my life very much.  Words: 204
