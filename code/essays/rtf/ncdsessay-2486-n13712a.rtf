Looking back I remember my school days and My first job but know I live at home and do the house work. I watch my children growing up and I like to teach them some of the things that I learnt at school. At 25 the house work is hard but I ejoy having a rest and going on holiday. When I had just left College I had an exciting time traveling to other countries as an air Hostess but now I just stay at home and do the House work.  Words: 91
