"I am in the air force and I enjoy it. I'm an engineer for the jet fighters, though sometimes I have to service the bombers, but this is not often. I am very interested in this and I am studing to get a promotion. There a quite a few clubs here for people off duty, and I go there fairly often, to the clubs I mean. I have made quite a lot of friends since I have been here, and sometimes we all go out together. The clubs are very interesting and there's at least one on every night. I think they are a good idea, it is usually one of the clubs that we go to, though sometimes we cannot get the same dutys, so we don't get the same time off, and we cannot go out together.
When I go on leave my hobby is remote controled areoplanes and I have one of my own. I have converted it to look like a ""Comet"" racing plane. It goes quite fast for a model 'plane. but I am trying to get some more powerful engines for it. I have not had it out for quite some time now though, because one of the engines has gone a bit funny. I can not have it out to much though because it is expensive to run.
The fuel costs quite a lot but it is good stuff for the model and I would not have any other.
I don't have many other interests apart from 'planes, though but like 'planes a lot, so I don't mind. The food at the strip is good. I enjoy this life of the air force, and I don't know why people moan."  Words: 284
