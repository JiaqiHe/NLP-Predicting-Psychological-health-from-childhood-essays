I am a Pilot and I fly a VC10 it is a very interesting Job. I fly half way around the world and I see lots of countries. I have got a wife and two children. I live in Somerset in a place called [village]. It is a very nice little village. In my spare time I build and fly remote controlled Model Planes. Yesterday I flew around the world to New Zealand and I have only just got back. It was really warm over there and I wish I could go for a holiday there. It is a dangerous Job and we all had a narrow escape once when I was in a dive and my co-pilot Just pulled us out of it. My co-pilot is Mr [surname]. He lives about 4 miles away from me. The nearest Airport is Bristol. Flying a VC10 is pretty hard but I am quite experienced and I enjoy it. I did want to join the Navy but something went wrong and I gave it up. Now I think I'll go on as a pilot until I retire and then I'll live a peaceful life at home until I die  Words: 197
