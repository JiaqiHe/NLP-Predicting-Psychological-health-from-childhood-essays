I used to in a resturant I was a waitress, but now I work in a big office I am a short hand typist secetary, I work from Monday to Friday on a Saturday I like to go skating and I like to go swimming. I drive a blue mini and I sometimes drive a black Hillman imp my petrol is supplied by the company as I have to travel 6 miles to get there. When it is holiday time I like to take a car up to (place) for a caravan holiday and I enjoy the sun if it is there that is. I was training to be a teacher but I failed my exam so I did not try again.
