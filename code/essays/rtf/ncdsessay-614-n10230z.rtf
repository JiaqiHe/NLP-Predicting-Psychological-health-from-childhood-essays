I am a typist in a department store and I lead a good life. [female name] my child is 2 years old and goes to the local day nursery, which is just across the road from the store. When I finish work at 3 o'clock I go to the nursery to collect Julie. 
My interests are swimming and reading. My husband is a Joiner and also enjoys swimming and reading besides driving. 
We have four dogs to look after. When I was 12 my ambition was to become either a kennel maid or a stable mistress. I changed my mind when I was 14 years old. 
My work holidays are not like holidays at all beacuse I have a lot of work to do at home. We nearly always go on holiday at Feast Week because we are all on holiday.
Altogether I lead a happy life at home and at work.  Words: 151
