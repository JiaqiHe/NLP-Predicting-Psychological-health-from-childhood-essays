When I am the age of 19 or 20 I am going to get married and get some children. If I get a little girl I am going to call it [female name] after my mum. and if I get a wee boy I am going to call it [male name] after my daddy. I am going to try and be a teacher and I'm going to stay on for a other two years at collage. I am going to try and get a up and downstair house. I am going to try and keep it tidy. I will go and visit my mum and dad on a Sunday. I will go to the pictures on a Friday night with my husband. I will get a babysitter.  Words: 127
