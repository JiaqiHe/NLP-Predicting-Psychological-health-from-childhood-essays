If I was 25 I might be still at collage and might be studying to be a teacher. I would like to help my mother still. I would go out to the cinema, some nights I would stay home and do my homework and until I pass I shall work very hard indeed. So one day I passed and became a teacher. I was expecting them to call me names seeing I was coloured but I got on quite well really Then came the time when I met up with a boy, and soon we became married. I had a lovely present from my class, it was the most expensive vase I had ever seen or had. I thanked them all for the beautiful present they had given me. And then came the most unhappiest time of my life it time for departure but I soon got over it. So if I was 25 I just might do that! .  Words: 160
