My job is designing clothes. I like the job. I go swimming and dancing a lot. I get a lot of money for my work, and I give a lot of parties. I enjoy myself, but I work hard. I have a house of my own, and have a house maid and a cook. I have many friends, and we all go out together. I wear some of the clothes I design, and so do my family. I travel over the world quite a lot I visit my family a lot, and they visit me a lot. I don't wear too much make-up. I don't smoke or drink, only drink on special occasions. I'm healthy. Probably write more stories and poems* for myself) I'd like to be kind.  Words: 128
