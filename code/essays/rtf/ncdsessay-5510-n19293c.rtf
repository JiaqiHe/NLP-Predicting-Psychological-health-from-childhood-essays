"To-day is Tuesday the 31st 1983 and I live in a semidetached house with my wife and two children. I work in a shop and spend the rest of my time playing football. I get up every morning at 8""6"" clock and drive to my shop in my Lotus each Saturday it is football until 5 ""o"" clock. My childrens names are Peter and Jane and we live In **** both my children go to **** School because I went there and got  well tought. I watch tennis, cricket, and football very often and sometimes play it myself. I have a boar with an in***rd engine and go fishing when ever possible. Both my children go to brownies and cubs but I did not. I still visit my school friends now and then and I visit my Mum every Sunday and we stay for tea."  Words: 145
