I would like to be a typiest when I grow up and work in an office. I would live in a house and perhaps be married with one child and my mother would look after her or him Or I might like to emergrate to Australia I'm not sure. If I went to Australia I would live in Hobart because thats where my relations live I think I would still be a typest because it must be good sitting in an office with a real typewritter. At home I have a typewritter its one of those perteal typewritters which you learn with. I can type quite a lot of things on it so pehaps oneday I will type on a real one and sit up a table in a little office of my own. I would like my friend to be a typest to she wants to be one. I would go home each night and see my little girl and then in the evenings watch television by the fire. On Saturdays I would take her to town and get my shopping like my mum do. Sometimes in the evenings I would go out with my husband. I would wear a nice new dress and stockings and perhaps have my hair in a bun I wouldn't want to have it cut off. I might go to dances. I think I would have a nice little poodle like the one I've got at home. I would have some nice furniture in my rooms and pretty wall paper. Sometimes I would visit my mother and father and other relation and then they would come and visit me and and perhaps stay to tea. I would visit my friends and perhaps to the cinerma with them and have a nice time.  Words: 298
