And I would teacher my little Boy if I had how to be a great football as well and if he was in the School team I world go and See nearly every match he played if I could and each goal he scores I would give him about 216D and if his team won I would give about 21 - ectleast And every Sunday I would go and See my  mum to See just how She was getting on and give her about 4 pound to keep her throught the week. And on every holiday my children had we would go to a little holiday in [town]. So they could go swimming and I can teacher them to Swin far.
