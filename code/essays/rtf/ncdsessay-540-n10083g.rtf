I am married, and have one child. I work at a nursery school 5 days a week and I have the afternoons free as it is a morning nursery school. At the weekends I do the shopping on Saturday usually and on Sunday I take my child to my mothers. I my child to the zoo sometimes and sometimes one of my friends comes to visit me with her child. I have two dogs, amd two cats. I live in a semi-detatched house in [suburb]. I have a television and a radio and I enjoy having them. I go to the library with my child regularly and we* often go for a picnic in the country which we all enjoy, especially our dogs. In the summer* we are going back to America and we will stay there. I will find a new job at somewhere like the R.S.P.C.A. where I will help look after a lot of animals.  Words: 158
