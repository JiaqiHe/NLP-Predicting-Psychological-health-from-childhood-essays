When I am twenty-five I hop that I will be married have my own house and two boys and two girls. I will live in a semi-detached house with a kern terria as a gard dog and a small rabbit. It will be a bording house and I will do all the cooking and then if the profit is big I'll buy a small hotel and go on from there. My wife will be about six foot tall slim but not dominering. I will have a car I hope it will be a Ford Capri. My mane intrests will be colf. We will all go out about twice a week to clubs. I will lead a good life with plenty to do, apart from keeping the family and bisness going. I will have a good bank acount with the Midland bank.  Words: 141
