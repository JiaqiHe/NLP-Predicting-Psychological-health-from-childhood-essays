----------------------
I have been a nurse for quite a few years, and I have completed my training. I enjoy my job very much.
I work at a hospital in London, many nurses come to train here. I do not work as just an ordinary nurse, but I help children to use there hands, because when they were born, they were deformed in some way or another. 
When I go to [town] for my holiday's I go out with my boy friend a lot, as we are engaged to be married. I will not be a nurse, and work in London all my life. When we are married I shall leave London and I shall be a house wife, and when we have been married for quite a while, I might get a half time job as a nurse.
London is much different to towns and cities in the South of England. I like the shops very much, and window shopping is nice too, though I don't think I would like to live in London for a long time, because I would miss the country side, and the New Forest, also I would miss a horse ride now and again, as I still enjoy a ride in the forest sometimes. 
I like reading books a great deal, there is a lovely library at the hospital, and at home my book case is completely full.  Words: 230
