----------------------
I am twenty-five I work as a theacer at an infants school. I like my job very much. I teach children aged 5-7 years old. I have to be up at half past seven and be at the school at nine, o'clock, so, that gives me plenty of time to get my breakfast and get dressed and washed. I teach the top class, and at night when I get home I have my tea and then start marking the work which my class has done. I am not married but I have a boy-friend and he sometimes takes me out at the weekends in his mini car. Soon I am going to leave the infants school and I am going to teach at the junior school. Which is not far from where I live. There I will be teaching the third year class. Later I hope to become a headmistress. Sometimes when I am sick or ill I cannot go so that is why some class's have students who are also training to become teachers. My name is Miss [name] but the children just call me Miss. Sometimes a teachers work is very difficult and busy with a noise class. but I manage to keep my class under control and quiet. There are nine class's in the school were I work. I have just got ingaged and I hope I can have A DAY OFF, FOR my wedding day, because as a teacher you can't just stay off for the day. My pay is engoh and I am saving it  Words: 260
