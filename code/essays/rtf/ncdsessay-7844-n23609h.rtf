I am now 25 years old. I am studying to be an mechanic in a garage repairing cars I work in the day and study at night I am married with 2 children. And I have a car not a sports car its a saloon car Two nights a week I go to night school. On Saturdays I play football for a club. Some nights when I dont study I do other things I dig the garden and cut the hedges. Then other nights I do some painting. We live in a private house in the country and we have a house at the seaside which we rent to people every summer. Some times in the summer we fly abroad to FRance or SPain for a holiday. Then we stay in a hotel. We give parties and invite all our friends and we all enjoy ourselves. We biy flowers and champaine for the guests. We buy expensive clothes fur coats.  Words: 160
