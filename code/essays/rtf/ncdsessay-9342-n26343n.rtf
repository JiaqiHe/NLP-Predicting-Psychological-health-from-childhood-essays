I now am 25 years of age I am married with two children. I work in a cloths factory and I enjoy it very much I earn seven Pounds per week. I am satisfied with my marrieg, and the life I am leading is a very good one, my childrens names are [male name] and [female name]. I go home and cook the dinners and then go back too work well the children are at school. All of my intrests are Cooking, writing letters. and looking after the children and making sure they go to school nice and tidy. My leading life I shall try to get a different job, with more money for Pay. I think I should get a job working in a restront as a waitress so I did, and I got xxxx10 10D for a weeks pay, my husband was getting xxxx20 16D a week for his pay as he was working on the building trade. We live in a pleasant little cottage in the country side which was nice and qiuet. We have a small car a dog & a cat and a Rabbit what we brought for the children. I'd like to live near by to the beach but all the houses were full up and not a single one would be hempty. It would be in Wales near the sea, of couse. When I was small Id only been there once. I like making cloth, Id make all my little girls dresses for her. After a while Id get fedup with the job of a waitress, and go back to make clothes in the factory, But he still would work as a builder.  Words: 280
