"I am flight-lieuntennant [name] of the Airmen's training college. R.A.F. [village], [county]. I want to be in the bomber command. I remember the first time I flew an aeroplane, I didn't get the taking-off right so the instructor made me practice taking-off and landing every day for at least a week. I have other interests besides flying, I still enjoy reading and writing about Heraldry, I was eleven when I started to read and write about it. How everything has changes since I was a boy. I can remember only one big occasion in my childhood, my eighth birthday. I have a new tipe 'E' type jaguar but at the moment it has got engine trouble. Next week I am going on leave and I am going to see my mother up there in Yorkshire. At night at [village] you can hardly sleep because of the roaring of jet engines and the fighters zooming overhead on night patrol. Our aircraft have nicknames and my Vulcan is nicknamed ""R for Rumbler"". She got her nickname from when she takes off, the ground vibrates under her. [Village] is near [county] and I often go to [city] to see my Aunt [name]. It is really boring to live in [county], the reason for this is because it is so flat. I never get bored though, everytime there is nothing to do I go down to the Gymnastics Hall and I do my exercises."  Words: 240
