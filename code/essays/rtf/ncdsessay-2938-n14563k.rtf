I would work with my father and helping him on his long journeys everywhere I would have a beautiful collection of stamps, and a lot of new coins. Up stairs sometimes I would be reading some classics, I would also be driveing a car. The jobs I would be doing would be fitting up fans and things, the woRk I would be doing is sheet metal working, like my father. And that I would not like to go to a Unaverstiy or collage much.
