My husbant is a shop asinant and I hope one day we may become more happier and our children have both brown hair the are twins and one is a girl and one is a boy the boy is an inch bigger than the boy. I Love going to church to sing. And I love singing at the choir and singing to god with all my heart is my joy. When I was little I did not like singing because my voice had not developed and it was very low. But now my voice has developed I like singing, and singing is my hobby. When I was at school I did not like the lessons and I did not lisen to my teacher. All my family are Cathelicks and I like to see my children go to church when I go to church it embareces me to see children looking round to see who is singing and I used to have the same habit my selfe.
