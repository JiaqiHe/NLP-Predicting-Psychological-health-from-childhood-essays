Today it is my 25th birthday. I train police horse and I dont think I,d change the Job the sallary is good and I enjoy the work mainly becuase I like horses. I am not married and I live in a renteal flat. I have a horse which I keep ay my friends his house is old and has a stable. In my holidays I like to go down to the riding school and watch the young riders. I sometimes help to clean tack and saddle the horses. It is a good life but at the training centre where I work I dont like leaving the horses when they have finisheal training. One of the horses that I particularly like is Blackie he is a thorerugbred and he is jet-black in colour he is in the first year class and is a bit highly strung but he should calm down. My own horse is a Haflinger and he cost a lot his name is Sabrina and he's a bay. My friend looks after him and I go down every weekend and ride him on the moorland. My friends house is only about a mile away and I go there every night to exercise Sabrina. I live Just outside Manchester. For my birthday I got a few handkerchiefs and some cards.  Words: 220
