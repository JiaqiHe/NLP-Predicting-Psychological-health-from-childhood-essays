I am still at home, and I work at a garage, and I like it. and in my spear time I find out all I can about cars. and how they work. And see if I can thicnk of things for cars of the furtura. And draw little plans of it if I do. And most times go out, but sometimes stay at home and watch the T.V. Some Sunday afternoons I go to [city] to the bowing alley. like I did with my brother wene I was about 10 or 11. My dad helpes me with some things I did not know about cars. and my mother is interested about my job.  Words: 113
