At the age of 16 when I left school I went to a training centre for the Merchant Navy. Now I am captain of SS. Oriana* 2 I have been all around the world when we come back to England I come back to [town] to see my wife and three children. Sometimes we stay away for a few months and sometime only 1 or 2 weeks. Since I have been in the navy I have gone up quickly in rank. I have been on many sjops and have been all over the world to New Zealand, Australia, America, Africa, West Indies, India, Japan, Maroco and all four corners of the earth. On board I have learned many things and taken up a few hobies such as woodwork, modeling* the last model that I made was HMS Fearless wih all of the acssesorys like helicopters barges, life boats, tanks, tank carries and little men and all the things that are on the real thing.
