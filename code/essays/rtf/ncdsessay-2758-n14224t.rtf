I am not married. I am a sailor on the ship H.M.S destroyer. We were just leaving the docks. 
We were now crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and going towards Japan. When we had landed the captain had a warm welcome. a bullet in bus arm from a Jap. We got of the ship and headed towards the jungle, all was quicker* until I saw hundreds and thousands of soldier ants. they were every where, up trees, on the trees. we started to run towards the ship but they were there. we dived in the water but ant's used leaves as boats, they were all over the captain. they got of the ship and we got aboard and we sailed for England. When we got back I had to tell the captains wife he was dead.  Words: 135
