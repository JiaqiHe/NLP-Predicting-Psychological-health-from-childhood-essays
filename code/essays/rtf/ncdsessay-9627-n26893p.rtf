If I were 25 years old, I would get a job as a brick-layer for [company]. But if I didn't get a job as a brick-layer I would get a job as a fisherman, because I know a boat which is safe and my dad knows the owner, and the boat I know always goes about two hundred and fifty yards from shore, and has caught a shark of [town]. I would get a house in the [estate]. Or down town near to the sea.  Words: 85
