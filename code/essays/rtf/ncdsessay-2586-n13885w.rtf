I am 25 years old. I am not married yet. I live with my parents. I am a salvationist and I am in the songster* tumbrels and I also sing with the singing company. My friends and I are starting a rythem group. [female name] playing a piano [female name] [female name] and I playing guitars. We havent decided on what to call ourselves yet but it shant be anything like The Who or The Beverly sisters. Every Sunday I take a class at Sunday school. It usualy is quite Intresting. On Monday we are going to skirbeck*. We are going in a bus. All the band boys in the back the girls in front of them and the adults in front. Just as I thought as soon as we get started they start singing. I dont suppose I was any better Soon we arrives at skirbeck. Every body's pushing to get out. The place is very small and cold but the people are kind. We take our coats of and sit down. The skirbeck peopole start coming in. Not many of them but still those who came looked nice enough. The srvice was long and boring but I dont suppose country people know how to run a service. When it was over they made tea, and biscuits were passed round I always say the end is the pleasentst*. We all load on to the bus and go home  Words: 239
