My job can be very boring at times when the actor do evrything wrong when scenerys wrong and the sounds wrong when evrythings wrong I feel as though I could resign* on the spot but it always clears* I once had a dream that I went to work and everything went wrong, so I stormed out and I had a terrible head ache so I went to a pub and got stone drunk. I got on buses going miles away from my house until I stopped at Watford
I was still drunk and I walked in front of a lorry the lorry skidded round and burst in flames. I was so badly burned that nodody reconised me and I had no place to go no money, I had become a tramp. then suddenly I woke up and thought I could make a good play out of it. but it finished like this I found my way back to the studio and they thought it would be a good idea to do reserch on tramps I got some money I called it ""The richest tramp in the World."
