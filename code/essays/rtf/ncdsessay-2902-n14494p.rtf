I own a riding stable I have 89 pony and horses I have a big house. I have a speshel horse of my own it is a palomo it name is chreey liener she is 16 a hands high is obedont and good. I have a stable girl could sue she sometimes takes lisons for me. We go up over contry lanes and up hills and have a glope across the top but in the padocks we have stricked lesons but they are fun. We do dressing work once a day and that is fun. One day I took chreey lerner up over the mores and I found some old bits of tree so I made some jumps and jumped chreey over them. but suddenly I fell off bump chreey stoped and came* back to me and I got up and I trotted over to chreey and mounted up and went home but then I desided to carry on jumping.
