When I am 25 years old I will probably be an architect and a serveyor (if I pass exams, degrees etc.) I would also have probably just come out of University. I hope to be still playing the piano and the French Horn ( I am going to start lessons.) I will be with a group of architects and serveyors and own an office and flat in the town where I work. In my spare time I might give private piano lessons. In the the holidays I will visit my parents, and during working time I will spend my time designing buildings, bridges, roads etc. I will have a small car eg. mini. In the summer I will probably go abroad with friends or relations  Words: 125
