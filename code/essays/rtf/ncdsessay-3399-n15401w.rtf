I have got a job at my fathers shop As I am now 25 years old, I am a electriction. On a Thursday I have a day off On the week-end I play foot-ball for [town].
      In my spare time, I go fishing up the Dam. I hope to go to Wembley to see this years Cup Final. The year is 1983. The Americans have 20 men on the Moon They have also set up a weather station there.
      The Russians have a man on Saturn A lot of things have changed. The half-penney has gone out of use. (The Decimal half penney) It is because the cost of living is going up!
      In China there is a place where they are making Radio's as small as the nail on your little finger. In Wales the Prince is 35. The Concorde is now going faster than it has ever done. The Q.E.2 has gone aground just off America. The Concorde has crashed (that is the French model but ours is going fine) In [town] everything is calm. This year they have put 20 thousand fish in the Dam.
      There has been a very hot Summer in [town]. My Dad is making a fine profit. This Summer you could not see a sole in [town].  Words: 214
