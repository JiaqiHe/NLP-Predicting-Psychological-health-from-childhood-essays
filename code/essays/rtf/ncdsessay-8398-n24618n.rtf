I think I will be married with two young children about two years old and four years old. And I would be well occupied looking after them and my husband. I would try to make meals with recipes. My intrests would be to make the children a few clothes and the rest I would buy. I would take the children for walks in the country and take them to parks to enjoy them selves. On other days I will get my shopping in for the house and things like that. And I will go and visit freinds and relations with my two children and on the way back we could visit some where else. Offen in the summer I would go to the swimming baths with my children to get them used to the water if I put them in the bath any time. And in the summer my husband and I and the children will go to the sea side in the car to have fun with the children, and they can make sand castles in the sand while I sit down sun bathing in the sun. When I am at home I will do a little bit of the garden to make it look nice, and put seeds in the soil to grow in to pretty flowers like daffodils and roses and all other sorts of different kinds of flowers. And I would take the children to a pantomine to make them laghe and to enjoy them selves with ice cream and things like that to eat. I will like buying a lot of things like shoes and coats for the children and my husband and my self. I will knit in my spare time and make little jumpers and cardigans for the children to wear.
