My job is at a gramer school and I teach* scince. Every night I come home and mark all the biology books. I am never bord of marking the scince books because I get difrent peoples views on the study of biology.
I mainly study birds as I have studyid and wrighten books for over seventine years. Now I take children and people on trips every sunday and saterday. I am maried and live in a small college near a wood and I have fenced off and area so no sheep or cows can get in.
I have other interests such as colecting insects and I have a large colection of them. I have a small minie which I go to the gramer school in. At the school I have many intrests such as observing fish as they move and breath. I have two young children which I take to a nother school every day
I am also a warden of my area and I get payed for this job.
