At the age of 25 I hope to become an arcitect for a ferm. I would much like to be in my Dads ferm as he also is an arcitect. I do like drawing, and planing for in this job careful maps and plans are needed in kitchens factories and houses. I would hope to own a house in the country, and perphaps play soccer for the local team. But before leaving my secondary and finding a job I would much like to be able to attend a college of sone sort. With my work and probably a family to look after, I will still find time for my friends. I am very keen on football, swimming tennis, and Rugby. If I am not able to be an actitect I would prefer some sort of Office work.  Words: 137
