Now I am 25 life is not so easy because I have got to do nearly everthink for my self. I have to go to work every morning half past seven to get money to buy cloths for my children and money to pay the milkman and other people who came around. I have two children a boy and a girl. I live on the west cost of Wales.
      My job is a shop keeper. I sell tools laders and many more things. When the summer comes I employ boys who want a job. I find young girls want a job for instance some ofer to keep the place tidy or serve in the shop. I begin work at nine o clock and finish at six. When I get home I meet a happy family. 
We have got quite a big house. It has five bedrooms a very large living and a small lounge. In the summer my wife takes bed and breakfast last summer we did very well. 
      I have a large number of hobbies in the summer I play bowls kriket and golf. In winter I play football for the town team I sored 14 goals last season. I play right wing.  Words: 205
