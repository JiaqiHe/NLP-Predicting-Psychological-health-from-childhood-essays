Let`s start at sunday. This is my day for relaxing, so I get up at about 10 o'clock. During the rest ofthe morning I finish off any off Bits of office-work I have brought home. In the afternoon I do the gardening until about 5 o'clock when I settle down to read. After an eight o'clock supper I watch television until I go to bed.
During the week i go up to my office in London where I work as a solicitor. This is a steady, well-paid job which can offer little bits of excitement, for instance last year I went to the Bahamas on business. Then comes Saturday, I go to the shops in the morning to buy and listen to pop records, and get some food. In the afternoon. I play for the local cricket or soccer team whichever season it is.
Sometimes on the evening s I go down to the local pub to have a drink. Occasionally I have a party and invite friends in, and sometimes I am asked out myself. As I am rather lazy about hosew**e etc, I have a person who comes in and cleans, a washing machine and a dish washer both of which I had to save up for. I am a strong supporter of Spurs and Middlesex. I have a La*cia for a car but drive carefully in it as I hate young men who buy a car and then drive recklessly in it. By the way every so often I nip up to (place) and (place) to get some clothes.  Words: 260
