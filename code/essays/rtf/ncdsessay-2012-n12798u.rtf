When I am twenty five years of age I would like to be living in [town] and have a nice large house to live in. I wish my job to be an International swimmer and swim for England in the olimpic games and win a gold medal. At home I wish to have a wife who will say at home and do all the house work. At nights my wife and I will go out and enjoy our-selves then come back about half past ten, and get to bed and get some rest because you need plenty of rest when you are an international swimer. on a morning I will go out about eight o clock to go to leeds to the olimpic baths to train for about six hours and then come back home to have my tea. On a saturday night we would go out some were for a good do and come back about 1 o clock in the morning because the next day it will be Sunday and you will be able to rest in. Then on sunday after-noon we would have a ride out in my car. I would like to have a sports car because I think they are the best kind of car* you cae get.  Words: 213
