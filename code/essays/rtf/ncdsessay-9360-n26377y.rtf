I am now 25 years old. I work on a poultry farm and I have four children three girls and one boy. When I am at work the children would go to school exsept the youngest girl who would be four years old, I would have my child in a nursery till I had finished work so I could go to fetch her from the nursery. When it is my week off or weekend off my husband and I would take the children out if we had a car. At night when the children are in bed my husband and I would sit in front of the fire and talk about our childrens life. Sometimes we would get a lady to look after the children, so that my husband and I could go out together. We would go out till half past nine to ten o'clock at night. If I had a day off and the children were at school I would go shopping or stay at home and do the house-work. I would only let my children stay up till half past eight or half past nine and no later. In my spare time I would do some knitting and croursha hats, jumpers, cardigans and skits. When I do some croursha I would do some hats, and also table mats  Words: 221
