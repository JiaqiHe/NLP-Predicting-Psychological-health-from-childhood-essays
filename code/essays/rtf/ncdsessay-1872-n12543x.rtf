I am working as a typest and I am intrested in typing I practise it quite often I am also intrested in tennis I like watching it and I also like table tennis I will live in a cottage in the country and I will invite my parents to stay there. I like cottages alot and I would like to take driving lessons so that when I have past my test I could have a mini or a spit fire. The I could ride round the country lanes and I would have a garage built for it. I would like a nice garden and roses witch would climb up a trelace. And pretty flowers like tulips and dafodils I would not ever smoke. And I would not drink to much shandy or eny elcaol. I will not wear pointed shoes becouse it would make my feet go pointed. I will not care Just for my self and be selfish. I will care for others And I will always clean my cottage I would never let it go dirty.  Words: 178
