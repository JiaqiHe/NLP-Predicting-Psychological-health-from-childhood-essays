"I have just turned twenty-five. I work at a office. My husband is a very good man he takes me to the club every Saturday and he takes me out every knight to the clubs in town. I have two children a boy and a girl. I take them to school every morning and I fetch them home at night. Every Sunday I take my children to the dancing hall to watch me dance. I can do every dance and I have got a medel for being able to do them. My favorite hobby is knitting. I knit all my childrens jumpers and cardigans. When I go to work all the ladies ask me if I will knit them jumpers. but I always say ""I am two busy on a night when I go home."" I live at a little cottage by a stream in a town called [village] it is a very nice cottage and it is very cosy. My husband is a miner at a old mine and I am always frightend at a knight when he does not come home while late."  Words: 185
