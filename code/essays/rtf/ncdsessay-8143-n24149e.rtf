It was monday 4th* December *arst day. at school. I desided to start finding a job. I would like to be a airhostess and travell all over the world. Like China and America and all other placests. I am a bit scared to go on a aeroplane but you* have to have lots of prates*. If i did not get the job i would try to be a school taecher and do things that are right. If evy one was talking when i was talking i would* say* stand up till home time or stand on the cheir. If i did get the job as a airhostess i would be very plecd in deed. If if was a very long journey for a bout a day or to I would give them there breakfast. I would grow my heir long and when i put my hat on i would have my heir up in a bun.
