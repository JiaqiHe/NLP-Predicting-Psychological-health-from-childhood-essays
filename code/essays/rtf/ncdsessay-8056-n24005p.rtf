"When I am twenty five I will be an owner of a menageri, not a proper manager just when people go on holiday they can give me thier pets like hamaters, guinia pigs, cats, dogs, rabbits etc. i will perhaps have a big garage to put them in or even buy a shop called ""The Pet Hotel"". At my home I will probably be married whith all the house work to do. My interests would probably be stamp collecting and collecting old and forien coins. I will have a lot of pets like an alsation a labradore and a Great Dame, a couple of hamater rabbits guinia* pigs and sicimese* kittens and cats. At night I go out a lot and have a dinner three times a year in which I would ask my friends. I would have Garden fetes* and things like that."  Words: 144
