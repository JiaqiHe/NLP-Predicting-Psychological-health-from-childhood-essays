I left college when I was 18 and went to try to get a job at estamating and laying new drives. I got a job and I am now working for my new buisness which is my own one. Last week I went to a man called M.r Smith who wanted his drive to be done. When I got there I had a look round and said he wanted to be done. He said that he wanted all the drive to be done over with tar mack. I asked him if he wanted some gravel on the top but he said he did not want it. Then I asked him iff he wanted kerbs round the side of the drive. He said that he thought he would have kerbs round the side. Then we measured up the drive to see how much tar mac he wanted. Then I told him when he would get his estamation paper and when the men would be round iff he excepted it. We said goodbye and then went home.  Words: 175
