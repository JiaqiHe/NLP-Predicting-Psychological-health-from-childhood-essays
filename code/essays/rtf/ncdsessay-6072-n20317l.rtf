If I were 25 years old I would be married and my work would be with the horses in my spare time. I don't realey know what my outher work would be. I think my life would be a very happy one with the horses. I would like to live in the country and have a very big garden. So I could keep a pony or horse. The house I would like would be a cotige painted white with moss and flowers growing up the wall. I think that 25 is a very nice age in life to enjoy your self. If I could not have a cotige I would like a bungelow. I would enjoy d*ning the cotige and doing all the house work. The horse I'd like would be a white one. It would be very well Looked after. If I lived in the city and could not have any of these things. I think the Job I would have would be with the animals as a vet. The hours I'd like are about 9 to 5 I would enjon working with the animals too. My Interests are animals and horse riding. A nother thing I would like to be would is a nerse that would be a very nice Job too.  Words: 214
