I am an art teacher and find this job nice because I take an intrest in art. I teach many pupils and some children do really oustanding pictures. I work five days a week and when at home I find its fun looking at the many pictures done by my pupils.
I have a small flat in London. I love trying out new things to cook and then to try them out to see how horrible they are. My main intrest at home is working in my small studio but also I love pottering around the garden. Another thing I love is animals. If I get married and have a house I am planning on having kittens, budgerygous guniea-pigs and other animals. Although my flat is small I always find lots of housework to do. My kitchen is always untidy. In the evenings I like watching television.
I always like to spend evenings with my freinds. I have quite a few The reason I like to go out with them is because I sometimes get lonly and like to have someone to talk to. We arrange a meeting place and spend the evening at a cinema or local club. I am hoping to get married soon but my boyfriend is in America at the moment.
One thing I hope to do in the near future is to learn to drive and buy a I am an art teacher and find this job nice because I take an intrest in art.

One thing I hope to do in the near future is to learn to drive and buy a caravan so I can travel round the world. One thing I really would like to do is to go to paris. I have heard lots of people talk about it and they have said that everything is bright and gay and I am saving up all I can so I may go. I am enjoying my life a lot and always try to stay happy no matter what the trouble is but I have already decided that when I am married I shall settle down. Of course I hope to carry on my job as an art teacher until I'm about 40 possibly older and I will still contact my freinds. I am enjoying life very much and hope to go on enjoying it.  Words: 584
