I was 25 when I got a Job, I was a Electronic and I lived in [village]. I was Intrested in chemestry, science. Later on in my life I would liked to be in the navy or the airforce. When I came back from work I would have nothing to do so I'd do chemestry which is an intresting thing.
I bought an Mini cooper which I could go fast in.  Words: 70
