At the age of twenty five I should like to be an ornithologist in charge of a bird sanctury in [village]. Suffolk, there is all ready a sanctury on the second dingle* which is a mound in the middle of the marsh. I should like too have my sanctury on the first dingle there is a single file track joining the two mounds together. If this wish does not come true I should like to be a metle worker but still live in [village] I shall still have an eye for birds. I should like too live in a bunglaow with a ten acre garden a large garage which would hold three cars, my garden should have a one acre lawn and eight acres should have trees growing and the rest flowers, I should not like to get maried.
