I am a policeman now, and I have been for the last two years. When I first Joined, I was on the beat, but now I am on crime patrol. I am the observer in a panda car, I answer the phone and look out for suspects. My round lasts about thirty minuites and I do it five times a day, I go on duty at seven a.m., and return home about six p.m., that is if I am on the day regulo, but, if I do the night regulo I start at five-thirty p.m. and end at seven a.m. I don't have a wife and I live in a flat. I don't bother to clean up and I feel awful if the sarge or one of the others at the station come along. I spend most most of my spare time making balsa and plastic models, and I keep them on the side-board, the mantlepiece and the dressing-table, and some are even hanging from the ceiling! I have just recently put a thin strip of wood across my bedroom, so now I can hang them on that.  Words: 188
