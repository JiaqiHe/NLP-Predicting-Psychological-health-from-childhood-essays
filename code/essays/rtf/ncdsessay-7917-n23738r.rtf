I'm walking down a street in a blue uniform, black boots, light blue shirt, black tie, black hat with a silver star. I'm a policeman on night duty. I live in a delightful bungalow with my wife and [male name] our 18 month baby. Many hours are dull routine patrols but other hours are full of hairaising adventures. Sometimes I'm on night duty other times I'm at the office back at the police station.  Words: 74
