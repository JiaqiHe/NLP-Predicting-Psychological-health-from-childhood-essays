When I am twenty five, I expect to take a part time job of riding and as a vet, for I love animals, and I hope I can collect every stamp that comes out. I would like to travel a lot and go right around the world. I say I would like to ride a horse I do not mean ******, I would like to show jump. My house would be in the country in (town) and very near the *******, I did drive a **** on the ****** and i would like to do it again. F or a holiday I would always go camping because it is fun a healthy.  Words: 112
