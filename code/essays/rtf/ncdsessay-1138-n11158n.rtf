when I am 25 years old I hope to be in the merchant navy. I would like to be in the merchant navy because you get a lot of money and you get to see the world and all different countries. I t better thahn work in a office becaisse in a office you getting all stuft up and you don't get* enough air. I n the navy when you stop at ports you can gel* same lovely girls at Fiji. The maney is good in anouth way because* when you wake up in the morning you get the lovely smell of the sea air and it refreshest you in the morning. When you go in to the navy you can go into all different parts and go on all different big and little ships you can go on the [ship] and the [ship]. I would like to go on the tanker that the EOSO s man made to *o carry all there oiel and petrol to other countries. The navy is a good thing if you want a job and the work is easy to do. When I am about 50 I will leave the mearchant and get a penchen from them*.
