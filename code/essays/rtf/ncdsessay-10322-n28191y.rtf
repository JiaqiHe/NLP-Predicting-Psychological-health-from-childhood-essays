I would like to own some stables and teach small children to ride and then go in for gymkanas and things like that. I would like to learn to drive so that I could go down to the Ice Rink for lessons. In my spare time I would go down to play tennis or go for a swim. I would save up to go abroad and learn their language, and go over with my horse to their gymkanas and horse races. I am very fond of art and hope to go to art classes, And when I am not teaching to rideing I would get out a piece of paper and sketch and pratice drawing things. I would try and get a Job as an well trained rider or a horse rideing teacher. If I go abroad and like the country so much I will try and by a house or a villa I would also by a bit of land for my horse. If I learnt the languge well I would try and teach foriegn children. I would not liked to get married at that age. I would probably go to play tennis with my friends. On Sundays I would like to go and collect wild flowers. I would hope that mummy would come and watch me in the horse gymkanas, and races. when I come home from my work I dance to pop music. My life is never dull it is always full of fun. I am always finding things to do when Im not busy but that is not very often. And so long as Im with horses and ponys Im always happy.  Words: 276
