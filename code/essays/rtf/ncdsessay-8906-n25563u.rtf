When I am 25 years old I would like to be a carpenter. I would have a Bungelow and a wife but no children. I would go to collage for two years. On friday nights my wife and I owuld go to have a drink. In my spare time I should paint and draw. I would hope to still live in Salisbury. I would go to dances as many time as posible and go to a wresaling as well. I would have a car. I thing I would have a Astin Heley.  Words: 92
