I am working in a factory, and I have a family to look after and supply with money for food and taxes I have two children, I lead a simple life I dont have a lot of friends I keep myself to myself. My interests are running chess and football at the weekend I go to see football matches and play for the workmens team. When I have spare time I play chess or get a bit practice at football. I work five days a week and get a good wage I get private Jobs on a sunday and have to work bout 3 hrs every Sunday. I never come home drunk for I drive a car when I drink I only have lemonade or half a pint of lager and lime with quite a lot of lime. When I get ready to go to work I get up about 9 o clock for I have to be at work quarter to ten. In the eveniing I sit and watch television with my wife the kids would be in bed and I'd be allright.
