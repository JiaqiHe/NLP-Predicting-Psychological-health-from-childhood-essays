I am a vetran surgeon, and I live in France on the Southren side. My house is made of white bricks it has a red roof and red doors and window The shutters on the windows are cream. I have a lovley garden. The front is mostly rockery. The back is beautiful, it a stream trinking through large rocks covered in lovely green moss. There are small bridges with little fat gnoes fishing from them, at the bottom of the garden there is a large arch under which passes the little stream. The stream runs into a large pond in which 5 golden carps swim. My pets a made up largly from wild life. I have a young otter in the pond called Flash, I found it on one of my trips to Canada in a cruel steel trap its right front paw swommen and bleeding.
