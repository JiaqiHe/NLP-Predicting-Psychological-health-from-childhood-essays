Now that I am at the age of 25 years Iam getting on into life. I will try to lead a good life and make my family happy. I will probelly go to work at this age and earn good money to make my family happy. I will try to go to Lourds because I think it is a beautifull place and I have always wanted to go and see it. At home I will try to make my family happy and lead a good life. At home I will do all the house work and do the cooking I will have the tea ready for my family when they come home. And I will take them swimming and learn them how to swim. when I leave school I have not made up my mind what job I will take. I would like to be a telephonest or a dresmaker but I do not know yet because later on in life I may take an intest to Some thing else. Or I may stay on at school for my G C e and all the other things But I would not like to go to universty. when I get older I may want to go but at this age I do not want to go.  Words: 215
