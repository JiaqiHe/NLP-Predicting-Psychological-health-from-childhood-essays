If I were 25 now I suppose I would be working I would probably be working in an industrial factory where the job is worth while. I would probably be married at this age or just getting ready to be married. I would be interested in Sport and Athletics. I would like to follow my farthers foot steps and work in a club where he plays the piano and trumpet. I would most likly go out to a public house now and again and have a drink of beer But one thing I would not do is smoke because I have heard it harms your health. 
I would probably learn to drive at this age I would like to get a Ford Capri. I would live some-where like [CITY].
When I come home from work I would probably wath the TV for 1/2 an hour then have my tea then stay in till about 930 and then go and have a drink. of beer.  Words: 163
