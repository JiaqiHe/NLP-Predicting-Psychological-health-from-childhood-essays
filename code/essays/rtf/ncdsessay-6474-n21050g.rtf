I am now 25 years old and I am a Fighter Pilot for the R.A.F.. I have a family of three, my wife and two children, the children's names are [male name] and [male name].
I can fly a variety of planes ranging from the old planes of World War I and the Spitfire's and Hurricane's of World War II. The Airforce gives me six weeks holiday and Peter is a fanatic on plane kits and ships. For our holidays we usually go to the South Coast and stay at a hotel, for a few weeks. 
I can do an Aircraft Mechanical job if one of the Mechanich's is away, and if a plane needs servicing I can go in for anyone who isn't there. An Aircraft needs about forty or fifty men to to check and clean it. An aircraft needs about two thousand gallons of petrol to drive its Rolls Royce engines. 
MY wife works in a cleaners and she gets quite a good wage, she gets about three hundred pounds a year. I get round six thousand pounds a year. 
Some planes have wing drop tanks, which contain petrol then when they are empty you press a certain button and they drop off during the flight.
Last week my son [male name] bought a tuber powered plane.  Words: 218
