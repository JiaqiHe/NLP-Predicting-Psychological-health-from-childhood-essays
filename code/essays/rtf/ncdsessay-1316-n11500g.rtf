At the age of 25 I would imagine that I would have a home in the country which is just outside the town. At home I probley would practice music on my flute ready for concerts. Some time I might go hiking with freinds I know, over the hills where I might find interestings things. I could go hiking for fun for a day, and come back in the evening. I probley would go abroad for my holidays and sometimes I could stay in England. I might go to night school and lean crafts and other things which interest me. Another thing I could do is go cycling and camping for one or two weeks. My work would be in the town where I could look around the shops after I have done my work. Some days of the week I could go and play tennis with a freind and probley afterward we could go swimming.  Words: 156
