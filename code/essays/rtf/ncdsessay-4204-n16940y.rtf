"I am an S.O.S. in the Norwegian Merchant Navy I have been in the navy for four years now. I have a driving licence for a car and one for a ship. On the next trip I am being tested out as a ""sparky"". I have loved the sea all my life and I wouldn't take a Job on shore even if it was twice as much pay as on the ship. The first ship I sailed on was the [ship] we took two cars over on that trip. My wife gets xxxx20 aweek off me and I get the rest for train fair and lodgings while I am on leave. I think ill wait and make a skipper before leave the sea."  Words: 123
