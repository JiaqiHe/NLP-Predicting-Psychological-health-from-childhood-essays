I am 25. I am married and have two children the youngest is 1 and the oldest is 2 they both go to the nursery at 8 o,clock while I go to work. I work as a teacher in the [school name] school and when I come home at night I do work in my house and then knit for a little while for my two children. I am knitting them jumpers and sow for them, one is a boy and the other is a girl and then I go to night school. In the morning when I get up I tiedy the house and it is all nice for my husband when he comes down for his breakfast When my two children come down they throw pillows around the room and it is in a mess when my husband comes down. The breakfast was burning and the toast was all black and burnt and so I had to cook all the thing over agian but I never burnt them this time. 
I like going out into the country for a drive or for a walk and I take my children with me so they do not get into mystouf. Or riding on a horse or going to the sea with my children we always do one of them on a Sunday. On a Saturday I get all the work done and do not stop soon it was dinner and then tea and then go and get our supper and then bed at 12 o clock. It is the same every day.  Words: 262
