----------------------
I live at home with my parents. I help at home quite a lot and have a part time job at the local Hospital. 
I am engaged, my boyfriend drives a car, we go into the country often because we are both interested in wild animals and wild birds.
Each morning I go to work in the Hospital. I come home for lunch and to not go back until 4 o'clock. I come home in the evenings at 9 o'clock. When I get back from work in the evening I make dresses for myself, and for my younger sister. 
I like my job, it means that in the Summer when it is warm I work when it is not so hot, and in the afternoon when it is hotter I can be at home, or go out with my boy friend, when it is his half-day off.
My job at the Hospital is to do odd things such as help in the large kitchensm cleaning medical instruments. I am also being trained for an assisant nurse.
Also in my spare time I make different Scrap-Books for the Childrens ward at the Hospitals. These are much appreciated by the children who are not allowed to get up, or are not able to.  Words: 208
