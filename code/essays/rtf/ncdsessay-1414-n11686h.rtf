I am 25 I have a wife and three children. I am an accountant and I work at [company]. I like to make things and I made a hutch for my rabbit the other day. I go to work at eight oclock in the morning and I get home at half past six at night. I live in [town] and I own my own house My children's names are [name], [name] and [name]. Once every two weeks I go out and clean the rabbits hutch. My rabbits name is Satchmo. When I clean the hutch out I put new hay in and every morning my wife puts fresh water in his dish and clean food in his food dish. Often my younger sister [name] comes to stay for the weekend and she plays with the children while my wife [name] gets on with the housework. Of a Saturday we go to [town] market and buy vegatables, fruit and lamb for Sundays dinner. I go to work and at one oclock I go for my lunch and go back to work at half past one. My mum often knits things for the children and only the other week she finished knitting a cardigan for [name]. My sister [name] knitted a cardigan for [name] and one for [name]. My wife is a funny sort of woman one minute she likes you and the next minute she doesn't.  Words: 235
