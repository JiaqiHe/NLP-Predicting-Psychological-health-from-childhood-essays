I am *** now 25 years old and I work with my father at his office. We sell whole sale and other things. I sometimes go to my uncles when I have a day off. He has a sweet shop. I usuly help behind the counter. My mum teaches at [school] [village]. I am hoping that I will be able to get a job at [factory] down the road from us. My uncle [name] worked there and after a four days in packing the jam he was told to work in the acid room. I do not think I will get a Job there after all so I am thinking of getting married and working with my father and helping my mum at home as much as I can.  Words: 129
