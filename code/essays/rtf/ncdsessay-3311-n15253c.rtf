I am leading a happy life, I am married and have two kids, one boy and one girl whom I often take out with me. My interests at home are playing with the kids, and helping genarlly around the house with my wife. My work is behind the counter and by that I surpose you can figure out what I am, I am also a part time proffesional footballer with [town] who are in the first division. I also have a pet dog who I call Snoopy and a pet cat called whiskey and a hamster named Drowney. My favourit pet is the dog Snoopy, because he is so unergectic. There I close my desciption of my life.
I would like to live in a morden house and a holiday for me would be a trip round the world, a job I would have hated to do was an engineer  Words: 149
