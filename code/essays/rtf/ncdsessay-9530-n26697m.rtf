I am now 25 years old and have just left Collage, and I am going to be a Barrister at Law, my interests are cricket and tennis, in cricket I am trying to get into the Surrey County club, but if I do that I will not have enough time for studying Law, so I think I will play part time as a batesman instead of playing every day of the week. At home I am the oldest of my brothers and sisters, I have two brothers and one sister. I my spear time I mostly fiddle with my scooter, if I am not doing that I am uselly out with my friends.
In the weekdays I go to court alot or am seeing people about what they can take up to court and what they can not. The other day I saw a man who wanted to take his Father up to court for smashing his wing mirrow on his car, his fahter had told him he would pay for the damage done* but the man just wanted to make a fuss of it, I told him not to take it up to court but he did not take my advice and nothing came out of it except the juge had told him not to be so silly. I go to church every sunday morning and take the [town] Crusader class in the afternoon. 
on saterdays I go Brands Hatch if the racing is on my favorit drivers is* Hill and Yokan Ritz.
For my holidays I go to Austria to a place called Pertisau in the Tyrol I can ski quite well and have passed a few tests, I am enjoying life alot and hope to do well and retire at about sixty I also hope to bucome a judge at the law courts.  Words: 304
