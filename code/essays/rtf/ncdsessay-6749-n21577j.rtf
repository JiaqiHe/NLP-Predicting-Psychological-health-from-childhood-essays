I am 25 years old and I am married. I have two children and a car and we live in the country. I drink pop instead of tea and we have an Alsation. We go to Scotland nearly every fine weekend. I have a job in a factory and we make plastic and rubber. for shops to sell. The car I have is a Rover 2,000 T.C. and we go out bird spotting and sometimes fishing. if we dont go to Scotland. Sometimes we cant go anywhere because I sometimes have to work in the weekend. I usualy get about xxxx27 a week. I sometimes play games with my children. Their names are [name] and [name]. and [name] is 5 and [name] is 3 years old. Sometimes I drink beer at Christmas and New Year and we get a taxy back home.
