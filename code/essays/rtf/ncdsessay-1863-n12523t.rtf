At the age of 25 I now have a husband and a 1year old child. After studying music in college for three-and-a half years I now belong to an ochestra. I, being one of the two pianists. I have already been as far as London in the ochestra. My large home is in **** just outside ****, we have a lovely view of the hills from our windows and the dight of the setting sun is a familiar one. My husband is a master at **** Grammar School for boys. For our holidays we visit Scotland or the Lake District, when in wither of these two places I enjoy going long walks over the hills or sitting sketching the seenery, in the evenings I and my husband make poetry up, he is very good at it because he is the English teacher at the Grammar School. Of crurse I am also a housewife, I really enjoy making the meals, trying new reciepes and new dishes. I am afraid I do not enjoy looking round the shops. I spend many happy moments with my baby, a little boy, called Michael. He is quite good at talking and is just beginning to walk a few steps. I want him to have a good schooling and be interested in music. When he is four I want another baby whether boy or girl. I enjoy knitting and sewing much more than when I was a girl of eleven. I am always knitting for myself, michael and my husband and other people. Also a lot of my own dresses I have made myself.  Words: 268
