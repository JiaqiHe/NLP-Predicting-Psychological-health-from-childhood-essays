If I were 25 I would get a job a library* looking after looks keeping them in good condition or if some one b*ought back a book with a torn page or some thing like that I would fine them about 9*. I hope I would get a good pay and work someware near* my own home *f I only got about 30 to 40 pounds aweek I would give about 10 to 15 pounds to my wife I could borrow books from the library and take them home to reach. Later or I would be come a chief librarian and be in charge of the library then I would get much more than I started with then I would give more to the family to keep them going. I would bring up my family and children to be librarians. The children would become better at reading or I would try to *get them in a university or c*ambrige*. I would move to a wethier place and bu*y* a bigger house and have an orchard. When I retire I will tell my little children to become to work at librarys and when they get married bing* there children up and so on.  Words: 202
