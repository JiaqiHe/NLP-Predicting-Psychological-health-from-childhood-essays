I am 25 years old and most of the time I help my Mam to wash-up and do the housework, every day I go to my friends and play games like monopoly and all kinds of grown up games. I work in an office and get a lot of work to do. I have a lot of interests, I knit clothes for my brother and I embroider cloth to make a tray cloths, aprons, skirts, etc. Even though i'm very old to be playing with children I play games with my brother who is aged 5. Sometimes I babysit for my aunt who has three children. At times I get sick of work but as I get bored a lot at home I wish I was at work at the office talking to my friends and something to do, I do odd jobs sometimes at home like tidying up the bedrooms, when my brother makes an awful mess with his cars all over the place, and if my Mam hasn't done the beds I make them up to. When  get payed on Thursday at work I get 15 pounds and I give my Mam 10 pound. Sometimes I go to parties with my friends, or I go to  the beach for a swim. I often have arguments with my Mam because I am always fighting with my brother. In about 3 or 4 years time I'm going to get married and the man I'm going to marry is to be handsome and generous, I'm going to have a white wedding, with a lot of little bridesmaids.  Words: 266
