As I look back over the years, I think what a lovely time I must have. But now I have to think about work and how the bring up my own family to think about. My wife is about to have her first baby and every thing seems to be going wrong. I have a job in a car factory and it is nice to work there. In my spare time I do the gardening with my new meachine that I made myself My interest is best in nature for I love the birds and the animals. My life is enjoyable and happy. My home life is filled the wonders of how I will set the garden the seed and which kind of seed. The apple trees are begining to sheed new leves and the blossom is beauttifull. My work in the factory is to work the presser to put theparts of the cars into shape. As the sheet of mettle is put in I flick down the switch and the presser falls down on top of the steel and the bonnet takes shape.  Words: 184
