I at the age of 25 am leading a peaceful life. No tradgedys or adventurous happenings. My interests are swimming, ballet dancing and painting. I soon hope to get married but at the moment I am at university studying chemistry. I have my own laboratry there and have boiling liquids in jars and instruments to fish out dirt or any other material that may kill the liquid I am studying. I have a flat in the university gr**** where I live but when I get married I hope to be able to by a house with my husband. When I leave university I hope to become a scientist specialisin in illnesses. 
     The house I by I hope will be in the county of Devon because I often go there on my holidays and enjoy the small of the fresh air there. The university I am studying at is Loughborough University, it is a very modern building. 
When I am painting it is mostly modern art, some paintings are just a few lines but others are a mass of colour. Besides swimming and ballet dancing I like sailing, I often enjoy a sail on a lake, river of even the sea.
