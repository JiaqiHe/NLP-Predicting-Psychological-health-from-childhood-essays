I am twenty five years of age I am a medical practioner. I have a surgery my first patient was a young child which had been ill for some time I put him on the bed and found he had got small pox which was very rarely found I quickly told his parent to take him home and put him in a warm bed because the disease could spread. And I would come round to see him later. So* after I went to see the child he was sweating I could see it dripping off his head. The next patient was a painter who had fell off his ladder* and broke his arm it was knitting together quite good I told him to go to the hospital in about one week. Then a telphone rang out the persson who was speaking was Mr [name] he said this his urgent Doctor he said I thinck my wife has got newmoneyer so I said I will with in a couple of minutes.
