At the age of 25 I imagine I will be farming on my dad's farm. If I work hard enough I might have two of my own farms before long At first I had better start of with two jobs mayhy's one in an industrial* mind. If I do get a farm or two of my own I will  be a dairy farmer on the pipeline system for my dad is installiing it in our big byne which saves him carrieing it to the churns in the milking units. I expect to have an arable farm to grow turnips and such like this I will use to feed the cows with in the winter months. I think I will take interests in trying* farms for my descendants out of the family. I hope to have* three children they shouldnt be too moch housework. In my personal life I will still like* collecting birds eggs although I might not be able to climb* up trees anymore. I imagine whem I'm twenty five it will be a different world with posh cor's flying* about on the roads. Needless to say it will entirelly new tractors as well.  Words: 195
