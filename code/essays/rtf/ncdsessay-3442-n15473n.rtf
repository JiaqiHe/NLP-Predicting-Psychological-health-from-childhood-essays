My life
I am twenty-five years old. I have two children a boy and a girl.
At home every day I do the house work dusting sweeping and cleaning. I like looking after young children very much.
On a normal day I get up every morning at half past seven to eight and make the breakfast. Then I wake the children up and we all go down to breakfast. Then I wake the children up and we all go down to breakfast. At a quater to nine my husband goes to work and I wash up and make the beds then take my little boy who is two to nursery school. 
I go back home and do the house work and at about eleven o'clock we go shopping. After we've been shopping I unpack the shopping while my little girl plays then I go and collect my little boy from school. After that I make the lunch and my husband comes back and we all have it. After lunch my husband goes back to work and I wash up then I read and the children play for a bit or we go for a walk. Later we watch television and at about six the children have supper then I put them to bed. At seven my husband comes home we have supper at about eight and go to bed about ten o'clock.
On weekends my husband is at home and we all go to places and go for walks together.  Words: 246
