To-morrow I hope it will be my lucky day because I am 25 years old and I am still looking for a job. I have five Children three boys and two girls and I also have my husband who works at hopkinsons and he get xxxx10 weekly for his job but he still says that I need a job because we aren't getting enough money to feed the whole family and I do agree with him. then we are all silent then the big bells ring ding dong ding dong then all then all then all the village goes silent except for the baby who and crying and the barking of dogs and the skraching of cats and maybe you are wondering why everything has gone so silen't well I can tell you why well you see everytime the bell starts to ring everyone in the village should be saying a pray and if you ever look at the clock at then the time should be half past six. well I think I will get to bed now for the early trip in the moring. The night is very peaceful and the night is also flowting by soon we are all in bed and all the lights are ot then not long after I had gone to sleep the alarm clock started to ring well it didn't seem long  Words: 229
