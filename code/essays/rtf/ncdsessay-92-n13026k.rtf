I am living at a house called [xxxxxxx] and I am working for my father It is hard work but I quite like it. I hitch-hike back home and have tea with my family. After tea I went out with my girl-friend. Her name is [xxxxxxx]. She used to live on a farm so she liked our horses. We are going to the Chinese Restaraunt in [xxxxxxx] for our meal tonight. We I came home at about half past twelve, had a coffee, and then I took her home and I went to bed. The next day we went to Austria for a skiing holiday. It is my favourite sport. They have lovely food over there. We stayed at an hotel called the Hotel Post. The Post was the main hotel there and there were dances there every night. After two weeks we went home. I too like riding and go quite often. It is lovely country around [xxxxxxx]. The following week I got married to [xxxxxxx] and [xxxxxxx] was best man.  Words: 172
