Every morning I get up early to start work. I am an editor in a newspaper. In the morning I have a special column for each subject such as Politics and world news when we have the sensational news scoops and sometimes a cartoon. We also have sporting highlights. Then I send reporters to the places where the news is happening Such as to football grounds, outside 10 downing Street and churches if some big star is getting married also to courts. There is also a place reserved for television programmes. Then it is time for a dinner-break during the dinner break I go to a nearby cafe. For dinner I have egg and chips and for pudding ice-cream and jelly. To drink I have coffee. In the afternoon I return to work to get all the news printed. we sell over 3,000,000 copies. When I go home for my tea I have cheese pie with a beetroot and egg sandwich. The I sit on the sofa and watch television. The next morning I go to church. After church I read the Sunday papers. My paper does not publish on a Sunday. For dinner I have turkey. In the afternoon I sometimes have asleep until evening.  Words: 206
