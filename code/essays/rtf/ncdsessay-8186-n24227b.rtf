I have a riding school which is very prosperous in bringing in money but a lot of this is spent on my seventeen ponies and horses . My daughter is only 3 months old and is very sweet she has jet black hair and lovely soft grey eyes . My husband (name) is very interested in show - jumping and has been down to the horse of the year show where he has won three cups and many rosettes . His main ambition in life is to be able to train his horses and himself to the upmost standard while mine is breeding ponies and to ma*e enough money for my retirement My interests do not just consist of lorry things like show jumping and breeding . I have an expensive hobby of collecting stringed instruments . I often play a very old guitar called old faithful . My brother is great at playing the guitar , he is in a pop group called the (music group). Only yesterday we held a barn dance in our biggest *a*n everybody enjoyed it except m-self as only the day before I fell of a horse while jumping and cracked my ankle . My total income for the year is 5,000 and as I've said before a lot of it goes on the horses . I charge *** *** an hour for a ride . My mother and father are alway popping in for a drink at the most unexpected moments Just now the joeiners plumbers and painters are here and the place is bedlum . I have a mini car a land rover and a horsebox . My husband has a racing car but I am not allowed to drive it as he says I ruin cars.  Words: 295
