Today was my birthday and I am 25 years old, I got quite alot of cards and not so many presents as I use to when I was at school. Also I am getting a new job of being a secetary, I have to type out things for my boss and also I have to do other jobs. About eleven o'clock I have a drink mainly tea and also a few biscuits. Then about 12 O'clock I have an hour to have my dinner and do some shopping, then I come back for work at 1 o'clock and I have another break about 3 o'clock and have another cup of tea. Then at 5 O'clock I go home and have my tea then I help mum do the washing up then, after, sometimes, not always I play a game with my younger sister and if my favourite programme's on I go and watch that or a film. I have half day on Wednesday, but then I go and have my hair done at the hairdresser's but I also have another day off at the weekend which is Sunday. On Sunday I help my mum round the house or if she does it earlier in the week and the weather's fine we go out for the day.  Words: 216
