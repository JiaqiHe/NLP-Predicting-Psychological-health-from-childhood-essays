At the age of twenty-five I think I shall still be training to be a lawyor I am not sure. I shall have a flat of my own, and sometimes visit my parents. I'll ask if it's alright about me working and I presume my little sister will still be schooling, so I will offer to pay part of her fees. When I am a lawyor I will ask my parents to retire and my sisters and I by putting our money together buy them a cottage and a car, even occasionally send them money. Mind you this is all my imginary. 
When I am settled down I may think about getting married. I also will visit my sisters occasionally. By then I hope to have saved up enough money to go and visit places like Switzerland, Bombay, Solomn islands and of course my lovely Africa. I shall even take out a child for the day whose parents can't manage to do so. I most probably will lead a happy life I hope to. But I wont forget my school I shall visit that, I'll never forget how kind it has been to me.  Words: 194
