When I am 25 I would like to join the navy, the air force or the Army and if I didnt I would like to be a doctor and if I didnt get that job I would try to get a job like my dad. I would like to be a footballer. When I was little I wanted to be a train driver then and astronorte and other things but I am going to get a job & am going to stick to it I am only a school boy now and I hope to get a good job. If I don't get a good job I just get a bad job and thats that. Even if it's a poor job like being on the Dust bins I am going to stick to it and I am not giving up untill I get a good job. I would like to be a fitter or a pilot in the air force or I would like to be a captain of a ship in the Navy or I would like to be a soilder in the Army and if I am not in any of the forces I will try to get a job as a welder or get a job something like that.
