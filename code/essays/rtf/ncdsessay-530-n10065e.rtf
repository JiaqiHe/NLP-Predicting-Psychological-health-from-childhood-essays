I have just arrived at the office. The boss tells me to go to London where there has been a murder comitted. I get into my van which has (name) printing company all painted over * . I go to the station and park my car. The next thing was to go to the phone and tell my wife I wouldn't be home for a few days. I rush out of the phone box just in time to catch the train to Victoria. When I get to Victoria I ask the policeman which way to Baker Street. He directs me to it saying its only a mile away. I soon get lost and wander into a shopping centre. There I go and buy an old record which was going cheap in the record shop. I then asked someone the way to Baker Street and I was told I was already in it. I find number 10 and go in. There I am told the murder was commited in flat D. When I get there, there was only a shop and I was later told it was only in the paper to get customers to come to the shop so after a look round the shops I go back to (place), where my wife says she is expecting a baby.
