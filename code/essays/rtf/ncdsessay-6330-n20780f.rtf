When I am older I would like to look after children and baby sit while there mums go out to a dance or some thing. I take two girls to the cinema of Saturdays we go every Saturday. One is seven and one is six. The seven year old one is called [female name] and the six year old one is called [female name] [female name] is always naughty. But when her dad hits her she dose not cry. [female name] can run fast she can ride a little bike but [female name] can only ride a three wheeler bike When my childre go to school i would like to get a job.

just for the morning. And come home at dinenr time. To get their dinner if they want to come home to dinner. So I would have to get home early I will go out to colelct them and bring the back to school. I would like to grow some flowers in my garden if I have one. I would like to put all different flower's in it but not to many. And I hope I will have a happy husband. And go on holiday some time but not to many times because some times costed to much money. We will go some times and take the children with us.
I hope they will enjoy it is we take them. And I hope I have a happy life.  Words: 238
