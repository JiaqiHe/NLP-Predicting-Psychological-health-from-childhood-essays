I am 25 years old, and I work as a typeist, and I am in a office. I live my mother and father in a house. My interests are going the pictures or going away for a lovely holiday somewhere really nice to enjoy myself. I like my work very much and I try to work hard all day long, from about 9.00 in the morning till 6.30 at nightime. Then some nights I go out to the pictures with my friends, or perphaps sometimes I get invited out to a nice birthday party, or somewhere else. I have got a car and go to work in it, every day. It is quicker than cacthing a bus or walking to work every day. I work 5 1/2 days at work in the week. At work I have my lunch at 1/2 past ten, and I go home for dinner at 1 o'clock. I have about an hour for my dinner, it does not take me long to back to work. My home life is helping my mother to do the house work, and in my spare-time at home I make dresses and that because I am a dress-maker. I have got plenty of nice clothes to wear, and nice shoes as well. My sort of hobbies I like to do is dress-making for people, and reading good books when I have nothing to do in the evenings. I sometimes go out to dances, and night-clubs, and I have lots of fun as well. When I get Saturday afternoon off work I have some lunch and then I go straight on to town to my shopping, and get groceries and food to eat. I sometimes go have luch.  Words: 287
