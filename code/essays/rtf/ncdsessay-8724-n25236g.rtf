My life is very interesting at 25. I have got a part-time job in a hospital and some day I hope to be an educated nurse. I am very interested in reading big science books and at night I do a lot of studing. I have a dog called (name) who is a labrador she is not easy tempered and is very good when I am away. My home life is just similar to my job but one thing that pleases me is that my dog never makes a mess in the house. I am leading a good life and I am never bored because there is always lots to do. In my back garden is a water-fountain and lots of pretty flowers and that is one of my many hobbies.  Words: 131
