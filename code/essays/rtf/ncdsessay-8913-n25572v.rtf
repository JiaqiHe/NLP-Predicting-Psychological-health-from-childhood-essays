When I was at the age of 25 my job was an Electrition. And my Hobby was playing Football for a team I played for [village] Football Club. I used to go to work at 9 oclock in the morning and finish at four in the afternoon but it depended what I had to do one day. I was wiring this house up and the clouds were all black and the down pour came and at that time they was a match on and when I came back out it had slowed down a bit but the grass. The team [village] was playing was [place name]. And I came up to the ground with my boy and his name was [name] and we got ready all the team, but the ground was in a inch of mud at half time [village] where losing 1 0 but at the finish [whiston] won 6-2. My other hobby was painting them art Masters. later on I finished playing Football and fitted carpets in my spare time and I had a man to help me with my job  Words: 184
