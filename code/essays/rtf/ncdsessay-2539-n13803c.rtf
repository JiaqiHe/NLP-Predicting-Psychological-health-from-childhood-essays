----------------------
My life really is just beginning. I work in a local goverment office in the town of [city]. It is very interesting. And you learn every day about somebody else and you go to different towns. I have been here for 6 years or more. My interests are ice skating but I have not yet succeeded to go all around the ring without falling. One of my other interest is dancing.
      I have quite a few friends and after we have had something to eat. I meet my friends and we enjoy our social life. My home life is very pleasant. If I have a day off or a holiday I work around the house. Then I take my child out for the day. lif eis very happy so far.
      I hope to live for quite a good age My work is quite a good experience. While I am at work my daughter is at a nursery and she has also made some friends. If I don't go out I sit and watch television or put records on or liscene to the radio. Another interest of mine is collecting dolls from over seas which I have had for quite a number of years. I sometimes feel sorry for some people of my own age who have to just wander and some even take drugs. All I hope is that my daughter grows up to respect people And I hope to see her grow up as my parents did me. And that she will lead her own life.  Words: 257
