I am twenty five years old and I am living in a flat by myself. I am learning to be a docter and I have just finished university university. I get paid 16 pounds a month became I am not yet a docter. I live in ****. My flat is on the 15th foor and I have a car to drive around in and to visit frends with. I have not got a t.v. and in my spare time I either listen to the radio, study, or work on my stamp collection. I have also got a bycicle and quite a lot of furniture. Also I have quite a lot of visitors including rel*tions and I usually get some money from them so I am not short of money. My flat is not all that big but it has six rooms. I hope to be a proffesional doctor very soon and I don't thier I will change to a different job.  Words: 161
