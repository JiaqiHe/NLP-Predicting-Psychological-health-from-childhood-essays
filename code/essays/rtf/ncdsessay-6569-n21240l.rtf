Every day I go down to the airport and fly around in a little private areoplane I am glad to get home at night and when I come in my wife [female name] has my dinner ready. In my days off I dig the garden or plant things when I am a fully trained pilot I will beable to go places like France, America, Canada, and alot of other places like that.
