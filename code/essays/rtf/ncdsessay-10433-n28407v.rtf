----------------------
I live in London in a large, roomy flat with my girlfiend. I am an art student at the london Colledge of Art, I have only one more month of training, then I am going to be an art teacher in Birmingham. In my spare time I like to dress make and knit. My parents live in **** in a sweet little thatched cottage, I go to see them every three months but when I live in Birmingham I will see them more often. Once a week I go dancing with some friends. I like it when I get a holiday and go to **** and climb the hills and go for walks and picnics in the country. In london the streets are always busy and the restraunts are always crowded at lunch time so I never get much lunch, I always like london on a sunday when it is quieter. I like painting and art very much I study modert art mostly but I shall be glad when I working in Birmingham even though it is still very busy shopping centre I will be nearer home. Art teachers aren't very well paid but I am a vegitarian so I don't need to spend money on meat. My friend and I take it in turns of cooking and we go halves with the rent.  Words: 224
