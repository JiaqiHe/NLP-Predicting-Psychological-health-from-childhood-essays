If I was 25 years old I would like to be a nurse. I would like to work in the [hospital]. The ward I would work in is the children ward. I would bath the children, and give them there medison so they would get well again. I would read them storys, at night time. The night sister is the only one whos up at night time. I would not minde if I was the night sister, beacause, I like to looke after the ill, if anybody rang the bell for me I would not waste time. off geting there, just in case they were in pane. I would hate anybody to be in pane, because of me not going to see, them. If I reached to be the head one, I would see that every thing was spottery clean. So that no body got eny other other illness. I would help as much as I could, and go around with the doctor every day, to see how the paitshons were. I would carry out my orders as I was told. I would not be afraid to help with a operatishon, because blood does not harm you or eny other things, like if you had to help to cut of some ones leg or things like that.  Words: 217
