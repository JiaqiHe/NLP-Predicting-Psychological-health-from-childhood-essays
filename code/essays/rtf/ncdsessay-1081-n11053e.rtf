My interests are to find a easyer way of building briges and dams. like the one on at the moment. You see Im a engenear on a dam which is bein biult across niagret falls in Canida. Its being construced for two reasons one is to colteavate the land the second is for nucler power. I am not mairred yet alothe I nearl did Southe Africa. wieal I was on a brige job. The macheans! computers have taken over. We do not have draughmen all we do is to feed the measarements in to a computer and it rools out 3D drawings. Back to my job weve got twenty feet to do. First we lower in sheets of metal about 3ins think. Then we put in slabs of concreet and bolt with preasure guns.  Words: 134
