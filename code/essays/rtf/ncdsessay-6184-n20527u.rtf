I have two dogs called Oygia and pikie. Oygia is a labradoor and Pikie a basset hound. They live with me in [London suburb] London. I work in the BBC Studios and I am in the art department. I share a rented house with a girl called Karen who is about thirty three. She takes the dogs for their walk in the week time as She get home from work earlyer then me. When I am at Home with the dog at the weekends they take up most of my time. I take them down to the common for a run because we have no garden but we have a yard  Words: 111
