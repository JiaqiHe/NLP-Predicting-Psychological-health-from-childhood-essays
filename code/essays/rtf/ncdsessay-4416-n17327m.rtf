I would like to live in a house of my own. I would have to do the work by my self. I would have to wash the floor and in the morning I would have a stiff nesk. My worse job wwould be washing up. My husband would be at work erning some money for the family. With three children I have to work hard. I would had to wash the babys faces or they would get dirty and get food for them. In the end I would had to go to work to *rn some money. So the babys don't stave. When I got a job I would had to ask someboby who I know to look after the babys. Then when I had finished my job I would have to give the baby some money for looking after the babys. My life would not be very happy. I would go over and see my mother quite often.  Words: 159
