If I was twenty five I would hope to be in a football team and own* a shop. The sort of shop I would like to own would be a book shop or a newsagents because I like reading books. If I was lucky enough to be a footballer I would be very lucky indeed. At home I would try to build a pond because fish are very interesting to keep, but I would not make a hobby out of it because they are very expensive and I would need lots of money to keep fish and own a shop. I would need a car at that age and the sort of car I would have would be a big one and it would be a automatic one and the colour would be rad or green. with a different colour strip across the side. I f I had a lot of money I would fly to America and see all the sights. I have always wanted to go to America because I want to see the Grand Canyon and all the other spots like that because the mountains of rock are full of lots of interesting things like fossils and other interesting rocks and minerals. My other reasons for going to America are to see the Empire State building to watch and study the animals and birds and fish and to write a book about them and to get to read some of the American books.
