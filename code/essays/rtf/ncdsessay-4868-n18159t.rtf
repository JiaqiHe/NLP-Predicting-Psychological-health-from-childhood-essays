I work in a cement factory* which is alright for me. I have worked up quite a collection of stamps, which I still collect, and watchboxes. I hardly ever get any now. I've been working in a cement factory for two years and I get home at about a quarter to six in my Ford Corsair ready for a nice hot meal. I have to leave at about eight o' clock to get to work in time. When I do the gardon I have to finish it, otherwise if I go in and sit down I'll never get up! I once tried flying an aeroplane which ended in a disaster.  Words: 110
