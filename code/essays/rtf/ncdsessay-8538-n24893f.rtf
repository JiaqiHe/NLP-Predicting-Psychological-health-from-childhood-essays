I am now driving one of the biggest lorrys in England to wales I am to deliver five hundred pictures to an art shop in wales I take my dog Tanner with me for company because it is a long drive and I often get lonly while I driving. When I get back I hope to find a small house instead of living in a hotel In the center of London I want* to live in a house of my own in the country I will buy a place were I will have plenty of spae to go dirt tracking on my motorbike. I enter for many motorbike races. Once I broke my arm and I was unable to carry on with the race but I recoverd in about two months. I go camping quite often aswell. I dont stay much in the hotel because I like it out in the open best. I just have my my meals there and I sleap there. I some times go to the cinima if there is a very good film.  Words: 178
