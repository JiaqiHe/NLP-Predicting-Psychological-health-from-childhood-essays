When I am twenty five I hope to be a veterinary surgean and working with animals in Australia If I become a veterinary surgeon I would have been qualified two years I might fly in an aeroplane from one massive ranch to another, treating big herds of cattle and flocks of sheep Man will be a frequent visitor to the moon, but I don't think he will live there Aeroplanes will travel twice the speed of sound and will be able to go to America in about three hours The doctors may find cures for the few disaeases that cannot be cured yet. There will be big steps forward in science and man will only have to stand near machines. And let it do all the work for him Great houses I think will be built, and the rich people shall have aeroplanes in their gardens instead of the motor-car which is used by almost everyone today. School children might be tought from tapes with a teachers voice recored on to it, instead of a teacher standing and speaking to them all day. Also they might have small type writers to write with instead of writting by hand  Words: 198
