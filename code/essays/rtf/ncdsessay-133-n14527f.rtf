I would like to help my father on the farm, I like doing some of the things because you don't have to work in a stufy office, I would prefere to be in the open, doing lots of things. One of the things I like to do is to plough a field and then put some seed in, then put do down to the farm and wash the tractor and macheen. In the mornings I would go down to the farm and do what father said. I don't mind getting in a much to much If my father said go and help the other men feed the pigs I would do so because I don't mind the smell of there meal. I would like to know how to drive a tractor or car for my own use, If something went wrong I would like to help if I could. I would feed the horses, cows and pigs with their food. Cutting grass with a tractor is good fun once you know how to.  Words: 173
