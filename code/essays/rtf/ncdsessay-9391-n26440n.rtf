I have a good job and home. I am married and have two children. I dont have much time for hobbies for by the time I get home I am very tired. But on the week end I go sailing and camping. I work in an Atomic power staition in the recarch laboratory. we work sometimes in to the early hours. I hardly got the job for there are about seven people also wanting that job. we live a quiart life in a small house on the Bank of the Thames. My wife and I have a hard time keeping ourselfs in a good home but she has most things she wants. The children are not very old but cause a lot of trubul.  Words: 124
