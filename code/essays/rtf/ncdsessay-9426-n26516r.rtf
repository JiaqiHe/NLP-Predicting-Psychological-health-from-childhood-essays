I am now 25 years old and live in a small house in ****. I go to wark in a ofice as a sectatary. It is very nice work and I get paid well. I do not go to the office on sunday and only work saturday morning. On saturday afternoon I have to catch the bus and off into the town and do all the shopping for the rest of the week. When I catch the bus to back home I have three shopping bags full of groceries and all the other necessary things which are needed for the rest of the week. When I get home I have a rest for a few minuets then I have to upack all the shopping and put it away. After tea on saturday I sometimes go out with a friend or to there house. If I dont go out I might have some one came  for supper. If noboddy comes I sit and watch the T.V. until about 11, o'clock then I switch of the T.V. and have a drink of coffe and read the paper until 0* 11.30pm then I go to bed. Then on the sunday morning I get up at about 8. o'clock and have breakfast and clear away. Then I go to my mothers for the day and come home at about 10-30pm and go to bed at 11-30pm. Next morning I go through the dame rutine again for another week.  Words: 244
