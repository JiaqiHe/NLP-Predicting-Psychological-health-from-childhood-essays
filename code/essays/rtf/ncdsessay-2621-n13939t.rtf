I am a teacher of 25 years old. I live in a house with my parents and my two sisters are married. i don't want to get married yet my house is 29 miles from the school and go by car to work. My class are six year olds and very lively. I still collect stamps and my collection is very large. I have a small red mini and often visit my sisters (name) who is now (name) and (name) who is (name). Both have a girl and boy. As I live in the country I own a lovely pony called (name) and I ride her every weekend Next week the summer holidays start and my parents and I are going to Ireland for a month and are staying at home the other month. The good thing about being a teacher is that you get lots of holidays . Tomorrow my class are going on a trip to the zoo and I am going with them . The headmaster is going too. I have a letter to write to my pen-pal but I will do it later . I stopped biting my nails years ago and they look quite nice now. I quite like swimming and am quite good now as I learnt when I was ten years old.  Words: 219
