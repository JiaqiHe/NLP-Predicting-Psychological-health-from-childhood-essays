I work in a office, and after I have done my work I go home to a flat which I share with a room mate. I do some stud*ing and then go and get some food. In my spare time I help at a youth center, play tennis and net-ball. I like looking around the shops and make my own clothes. I also go to evening classes to learn, sewing, cooking and art. On my free day (sunday) I go to church and study books on mathematics. My work in the office is typing letters and short-hand. I work six days aweek from 9am. to 6 p.m. I have a meal at the cantin and some coffee at 11am*. I'm not the only one in the office because there is other girls inculeding my room mate. I get six pound a week. I eat mostly tinned food except on sunday when I take turns to cook a meal I have many friend who join me in my hobbies. I have a pet buggie and few gold-fish. I work very hard and like my job.  Words: 184
