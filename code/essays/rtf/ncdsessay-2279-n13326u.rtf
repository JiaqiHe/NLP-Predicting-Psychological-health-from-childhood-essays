"I am now 25 and so far I am enjoying my life. I am a nurse and I have seen many terrible illnesses. Soon I will be made a sister. I will be made a sister soon because I have been in nursing life for seven years. 
Yesterday Mrs [surname] had a baby and she said that I could be an aunty to it.
I am working nights this week and last night Mr. [surname] looked terrible. When he called me and I came to him I got a shock he was walking as soon as I saw him I called the doctor. I was shocked because Mr [surname] had been in and accident and could not walk. 
When I aksed him how he had learned to walk he said, ""Well when you left me on my own, in the bathroom I taught myself how to walk."" When I heard this I said to Mr [surname], ""You are a rascal I was wondering why you did not take very long having your bath before I came to help you into your chair. I thought I had seen some wet foot prints.
When I get home in the morning I go straight to bed and stay there until seven o'clock. I am very tired when I get home. 
On Saturday I am getting married to my boy friend and I think we will be happy."  Words: 232
