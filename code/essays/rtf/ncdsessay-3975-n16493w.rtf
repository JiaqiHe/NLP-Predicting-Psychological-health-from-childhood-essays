I am at the age of 25 and still enjoying work as an air hostess. As an air hostess you get around to different places and I find it very interesting. I have one child already and it is a little girl called [female name]. [female name] is one and will be two in about three months time. When I am not at work I enjoy playing with Jannine and getting her to take an interest in different things. We have a dog (a labrador) and I play with him often. When ever we go out Jake (as we call him) always comes with us. [female name] takes an interest in him too. Whenever Jake is within reach of [female name] she always smacks him. Jake used to turn round and barked at her, but now is getting use to it. My husband works at the Tectronics and while we are both at work [female name] stays with her Gran. We have two cars (aren't we rich) so that I can drive home when I finish my work. This saves [male name], my husband from finding out what time I finish work and trailing right from [school name?] to the Forest. I passed my driving test when I was twenty so I have had five years of practise and now I am quite a safe driver!  Words: 226
