----------------------
I am District nurse in a little village in (town). I live in a small thatched cottage at the edge of the village. Every morning I have to get up at six o'clock to get my husbands breakfast. He is the General Practioner of the village and has to be at the surgery by 9'o clock.
at 9.30 I set off on my rounds in my austin 1,000 Some of my patients are difficult like old (name) the diabetic who I have to go to every morning to give her, her injection just because she will not give it to herself. Others though are very lonely such as old (name) who lives in the dingy old house behind the factory. I have not seen him outside his front door ever since I came here.
On Friday evenings I take the local Guides for first-aid it is quite funny really to see them all getting tangled up in the bandages.
On Tuesday evenings I take the local church choir. We are practicing for the Messiah at the moment You should hear some of them *roa*ing away on the high notes.
During my very little spare time I like reading and gardening but invaribly somebody comes and tells me that there has been an accident.
Every month I go back to London to see my parents and friends. I had a very happy life and want to keep it that way.  Words: 234
