IT was March 6th three days to my birthday. I had asked for four days leave, and the captain agreed. I had now been in the navy nine years serving under the command of Capt smith, we were good friends and he let me have the leave because in a weeks time I had three weeks leave, but still hms tiger was stationed at southend so I had only 20 miles [illegible]. I caught the 820 train to [illegible] when I arrived I called a taxi which took me to [streetname] Road I went round the back of the house and knocked on the door, Mum opened it and when she saw me she fainted. I quietly got some water and she came to. We went into the lounge and started to talk, at 5,oclock, 17,00 hrs to my Dad and [xxxxxxx] came in and when they saw me they nearly fainted to. after we had talked a bit I asked where [xxxxxxx] my brother and [xxxxxxx] my sister were, [xxxxxxx] said They [illegible] come in until 7.30 at 6 oclock I went for a walk and as I turned a corner I bumped into [xxxxxxx] I said 'sorry' and looked at her then I said 'Tell you what to make up for it I'll take you out to dinner' so we went to the 'birds nest' for dinner afterwards I said 'what's your name' and she said '[xxxxxxx]', 'Why' 'because I want to see you again' after a while she said 'i'm free on the ninth' 'alright' I said 'say 3.30' 'fine' said lucy 'Where do you live' 20 [streetname] Rd'.
