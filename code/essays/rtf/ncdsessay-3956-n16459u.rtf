At the age of 25 I have a good life because I am happy and satisfied in what I do. I am a housewife and I have two children aged one and three. I do a part time job which is helping people and at weekends I spend my time writing books. My interests are making clothes and swimming because I find that they are useful things to do. My work at home is done with a happy spirit although I shall be glad when my children are at school. My husbnad is a bank manager and I do not see him till late at night. My social work is done on every other day and when I am away my mother looks after the children Some days I feel a little worn out but after a drink of milk and a good rest I feel on top of the world again. It is not very often that I get bad tempered because I know that people begin to dislike you when you have certain attitudes like it. My friends often call me big [female name] because I am so plump and of course it is only a nickname. Nearly every day I have a good laugh with my friends when I invite them round for tea or coffee in the morning. My best friend who is a half-cast tells me of her home in Jamaca and my pen friend in Australia writes and tells me the news over there. I go to a gymnasium club to do exercises and try to lose a bit of weight at night time some people say that they don't know how I manage to do so many things but I enjoy my life  Words: 290
