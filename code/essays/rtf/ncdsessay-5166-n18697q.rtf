I am 25 years old and I am teaching music at a school and am getting on quite well. I have got married to a man called [name]. He is very nice and handsome. I am not at home for very long because I am either at colledge or teaching music. I do quite a lot of embrodery now because it is good fun. I am the captain of a guide company that meetes every thursday at the scout headquaters. But sometimes I cannot go as I have to much work to do. Teaching music at a school is very hard work and is always tiring at the end of the day so I always like to have an early night if it is possible. My husband is an enginearing lighting-fiter and he comes home quite late but gets a good amount of pay for it. He likes his job. It is a good profession so he keeps his job and has lots of friends. I hope that I have two nice and pycicly good children. I would not like them to be twins. I would like one of them to be a boy and the other to be a girl. As my husband is excellent at mathamatics and arithmetic, I hope it will be passed down the family to our childRen. I want to avenchaly teach childRen privatly music and singing and enter them for competitions and hope that they win prises and are successful. I hope to do this from then onwards.  Words: 254
