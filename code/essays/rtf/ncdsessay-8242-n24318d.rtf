I have just left University and I work as a vet . In my sugeory I usualy have dogs or bugies or very common animal coming to me . Also I have people coming to me with animals that are practicly dead and I can't do anything about the and both the owner and I feel very sad but animal have to die . I am not yet married but I have a house of my own and sometimes I have to get up very early to go to the surgeary because some animals are very ill . I like reading in my spare time.  Words: 105
