I am the local Policeman and I live at the Police station. I lead* a very busy life especially in summer when there are so many visitors in [village]. Very often the telephone rings early in the morning so I have to be out of bed early every day. So many people want to make enquiries and many of them ask me of a nice place where they can stay. Shearing time is almost here and as tehre are so many farmers in the area, I am kept busy on the farms during the sheep sheaing time. Although the roads are not very good around here, we get very few accidients, so I am very lucky.
I am married and I have two children, one boy and one girl. Because I am a policemanm they are naturally taught to behave themselves. I get two days off every week. When this happens on a week-end I take my family out in the car. When I have time to myself I relax in the house or go out fishing. I am a member of the local rugby team and play scrum half. When the cricket season comes, I play for [town] town.  Words: 199
