I am married and have two children a boy and a girl. the boy is 3 and the girl is 4 the boy has light hair and blue eyes he is quite short and is quite thin the girl has blond hair and brown eyes she is tall and quite thin. the kind of house we would live in would be three bedrooms a toilet up stairs and one down stairs a longe and a dinning room and a kitchen. then I would like another boy and he would have brown hair and brown eyes he would be tall and quite thin whe he is two I would like not to have any more. I would call the eldest boy [male name] and the youngest [male name] I would call the girl [female name]. I would send them to a good school and I would teech them good manners I would not be horrible to them and smack them. only if necersery. the boys would have some mischief in them If we did not have much money I would go to work as a shop asitent. I keep the house tidy and clean. the children are allowed to do quite a lot of things by them. selfs according to where* they are. I spoil them quite a lot and let them have what toys and things they want as long as I had the money to buy them with. the children would not be allowed to be spiteful and selfish and rude. I enjoy washing clothes and ironing and cooking and doing all of the housework.  Words: 266
