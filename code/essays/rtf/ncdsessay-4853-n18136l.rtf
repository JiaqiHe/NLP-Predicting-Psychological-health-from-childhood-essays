I am Mrs J. [surname]. I am English. I live with my husband in [suburb]. We have a very nice detached house. I am a script writer at Yorkshire Television. I type scripts for Casle Haven and Coronation street. My husband is a Bank Manager at the Midland Bank. I work from 9 o'clock till 5-30 in the evening. When I get home I make the tea for us. He's always in time for tea, because he enjoys it so much! After tea's finished and everythings washed and put away we read or watch television. If it is nice weather we sometimes do some gardening.
I enjoy look after plants in the house. I love to watch them day by growing into fine plants. I don't work at weekends so I have time to wash and iron. On Saturday night we usualy go to the pictures or to the club. Sunday is a day of rest we sometimes go out for tea at a cafe. This I love.
Its getting nearer to the holidays every day. Just htink tomorow we will be going to London for a week. After tea we packed our suitcases and went to bed early, for we had to get up a 5 o clock in the morning. After Breakfast the next day we set off for the train. When we got there we saw the post office tower. We collected postcards for our album. The days went quick but we did enjoy our-selves. We also sent cards to our family and bought them presents.
