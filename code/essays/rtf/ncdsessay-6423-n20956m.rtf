I am a married man, I was married at the age of twenty one. We had a child last year and he can just about walk now. It is a boy and his name is [male name]. When I was a boy I used to be in a church choir and I still am, only in the men's. We have still the same choir-master, Mister [surname]. I passed all my piano exams except the last one which I had to retake and then passed, that was grade eight. I now play the organ, I first started taking lessons when I was nineteen and I enjoy playing both the piano and organ. My job is a bank manager, which I like being. We have a bank house which is very large and it is just over the top of the bank. I am working in a National Provinsial bank.  Words: 148
