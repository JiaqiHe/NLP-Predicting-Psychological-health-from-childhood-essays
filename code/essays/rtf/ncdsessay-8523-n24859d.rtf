I think I will have a whole lot of shops all over the country, and have one for me to run, and have other people to run the other branches. I even might own a garage if I dont have a sports shop. And be a machinc and repair all the veicles as I always have a mind for Mending all sorts of things. The house would be in some where surrounded by trees.

And bushes etc. It would be in the heart of the country. And if I did become a footballer I would have trials with a lot of clubs first. I would not mind becomign a tennis player. the one sport I would not like to become one of is a cricketer as I think is a slow stupid game, Another thing I would like to do is travel abroad a lot and visit all the 

countras of the world. If I had enough money I would do this in my own cabin cruiser and hire a crew. One place I would particaly like to visit is the West Indies such as Jamaca.  Words: 244
