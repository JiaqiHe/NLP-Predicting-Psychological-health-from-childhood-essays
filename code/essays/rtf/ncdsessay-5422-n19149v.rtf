I live in [town], a city with quite a few factorys, and have a house in the lake district by [lake]. Life in [town] is very busy and it is a relief when I can go to my house in the country. There it is peaceful and I can stroll around the fells without fear of any cars. My main interests are boating, fishing, shooting and skiing. I Like boating because, especcially in sailing you get a few tips into the water which is rather fun. Fishing is fun because of the ba*ler you have in trying to catch a fish and also because you can have food strait from the river. Shooting is as usefull as it is fun. Shooting clay pigeons is one thing, shooting starlings and other pests is another. In skiing you get thrills of the fresh air, and you, shooting down a hill at Top speed and going up in a cable car. Life at home is the best. I have a wife and a child of two and also a dog. my child is very inquisative and once he started trying to pull the piano to pieces, but luckily I was able to stop him in time. At home I do most of my boating as I have a canoe, a rowing boat, and a sailing boat in the lake district. I am alowed a holiday from work once every 6 months. my work is a doctor at [town] and I sometimes have to help with an operation. Being a Doctor is very hard, but I get a lot of money for it. I hope eventually to become a surgeon, but I will need a lot more practice till I do.  Words: 287
