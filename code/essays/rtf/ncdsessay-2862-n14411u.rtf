I am working as an architect and part time engineering and any spare time I look up on architecture and engineering. At home I read books and watch television. Being an architect is quite a hard job but if you work hard at it, it would be quite easy. Engineering is not as hard as architecture because it is not as complicated. As an architect there are a lot of plant to make and it takes quite a long while.  Words: 80
