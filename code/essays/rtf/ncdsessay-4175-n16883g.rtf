I am now twenty five years old. I have got a job as an Air Hostess. I am very happy about my job. My main interests are about earning enough money to buy new clothes and food, and to have some new wallpaper on the walls. To meet new friends and to have little evening partys with my friends. At home I help my mother and father by shopping for her and looking after my little brothers or sisters. When I go out I like to go to the pictures and go for walks around the park and the fields. I often buy the cushion covers and do all the work at home and my mum has to make my tea for when I get home. I plan to get married when I am about thirty and have about three or four children at least.  Words: 145
