I am 25 years old I am a teacher and I teach riding horses, I am not married and in my spare time I go driving and also I do a lot of knitting for myself, I live in London and I have a bungalow in the country sometimes I go abroad for my holidays, and sometimes I go down to Cornwall and see my relations. I enjoy making up hairstyles for myself I have an alsasian dog and a white furry cat which I enjoy combing a lot. My alsasian dog always likes coming for a ride with me in my car but sometimes I do not let him because he fiddles with all my cars gears Which I do not like very much.  Words: 125
