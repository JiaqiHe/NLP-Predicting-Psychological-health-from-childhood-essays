I am a school teacher and work at a grammar school. I teach three subjects Needlwork, Art and English. My interests are dress making and cooking. I hate wiping-up. I have a easy life because I am out all day, I tidy up at the weekends and don't have to bother when I get home from school. At the weekends I go out shopping for I have not time in the week days. At needlwork sometimes I wish I were one of the children doing it. I am not very good at drawing but I like to watch the children doing art. When I get home at night it is nice to sit down and relax. I get on with the children quite well and I get on well with the teachers.  Words: 132
