When I am 25 years old my work would be buchering or I would be drawing. My hobby would be collecting stamps and swimming. I would go in the army or the navy. I would do alot of gaorden work. For my house I would like a bunglow with a big gaorden round it. I would go swimming alot. Gaordening would be anaother hobby. I would be a bucher because my dad is a bucher.  Words: 75
