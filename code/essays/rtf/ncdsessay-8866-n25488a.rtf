I am 25 years old and have one child, her name is [name], she is 3 years old. I marrued when I was 22. I am a teacher at [campus] I teach science and pysical education. Yesterday we had our sports day, in which [name] and [name] both scored 3 firsts and two seconds. Unfortuneally [name] did not recieve the award because [name] ran a fraction faster in her races. When I had collected my daughter from her nursery school we went home. I then went into the kitchen began to make a salad. While I was makeing it the telephone rang, it was my elder sister she told me she would be down by half-past, five. By half-past five every thing was ready. my young daughter was very excited, suddenly there was a knock at the door I ran to open it. There just by the door was my suntanned brother and his wife and son. Soon after that my sister arrived. After I had cleared away my baby sitter came to look after the children while we went to the cinama.          The End.  Words: 185
