Now I am 25 and I am a scientist working on space travel. I am fairly well off, I have a private house and a car. Soon I hope to be famous. I like being a scientist because I travel a lot and the wages are good. Last month I went to America to do some research on the Americans latest space project. I am married but I have no children. Out of work I like playing rugby for my club I also like gardening. In my garden I have some cabbage, carrots and potatoes in the vegetable patch and Delihers and roses and also some daffodils in the front garden. Sometimes me and a few friends like to go fishing and hunting. This Saturday I am going up the club to celebrate our cup final win last Saturday. The score was 36 to [rugby club] (thats us) and 26 to the [rugby club]. Our wives are invited to. Soon it will be my wifes birthday and I am still wandreing what to buy her. Soon after that comes Christmas and I have to buy presents for friends and relatives. I have 2 neices and 1 nephew. One of the neices is 6 years old the other is 4 years old and the nephew* is 8 years old. Altogether I have to buy 16 presents. I enjoyed christmas when I was the child who people bought for but now I am buying most of the presents. That is one of the disadvantages of being a grown up.  Words: 257
