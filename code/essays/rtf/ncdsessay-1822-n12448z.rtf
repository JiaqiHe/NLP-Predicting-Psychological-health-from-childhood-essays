I cannot realy say what life I will be leading when I am twenty five becuase that is in the future, therefore I will write about what I would like to do. I would like to run a Riding School I like horses and would like to work with them. I would have a big school, it might be in Devon or Corwall, my price per hr would not be high and I would do my best to please people. I would like about two dozen horses and about one dozen ponies, and some dogs and cats. I woud like to enjoy my work.  Words: 104
