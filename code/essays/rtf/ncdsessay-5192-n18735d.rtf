My name is (name), I am a surgical nurse in (place). I have wanted to be a nurse for years ever since I was I patient in this hospital in 1969 I was in the hospital on my eleventh birthday I have not usually a very good memory but I remeber this clearly. In spare time I like playing tennis hockey and other outdoor games. It is very hard being a nurse for I am rather sympathetic at times and I cannot stop my work to keep sumpathying. Although just looking at the diseases illneses and misfortunes of other people I have too feel the pain myself. I have a great love toward babies especially a small baby who has bracknell (brittle r***** !) bones therefore she will be in and out of hospital all her life because as soon as she stands up she fractures all the bones in her legs
I miss my family at home although I enjoy my work very much indeed. Even when we are off duty if we see any danger we must always help as if we are on duty.
Nursing is an excellent employment so when children are older I encourage them to go an train and then finally become either a medical or a surgical nurse which is very worthwhile and for a good cause.  Words: 222
