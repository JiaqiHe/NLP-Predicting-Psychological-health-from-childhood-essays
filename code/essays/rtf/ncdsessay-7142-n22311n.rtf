To-morrow I shall bestarting playing at a concert in the (place). My old music teacher (name) shall be there watching me This reminds me of my Grade 2 exam. I sat when I was 11. I was waiting and waiting for my result and when I re*icved it I was as glad as could be. When I was in Primary School I learned to play the recorder. I was very interested in this. After this concert I shall be going to a school to teach music. I think my music teacher will be very proud about me. I have been going to music lessons for 17 years. When I first started I hated it but now I think it is the best thing you could do. You may get some peices you know very well on the other hand you may have never heard about them . Some of the theory is easy some of it is very hard. I hope to win a medal because medals in music are very hard to get. I've got a few from Elocution for Bible Reading. My mother and father are very pleased with me. I hope to have a placing in the (place)  Words: 201
