I am 25 years old and i am a farmer i like helping my father to work on the farm. It is hard work in the summer and the corn is geting rip so we start to cut it with a combin. We have to cut it and the corn go ito a cart to be taken to the barn to store for the winter, and the straw go out the bake, to wiat for the baler. Witch paces it and ties it for us to pot an the traler and take it to shed and put on the elevater to go to the toap of the rick in the shed the elevater is work of a moter like a telgot tone moer of peterol it has some spikes that you put the baell on to send it to the tope. There ar men at the top to stak and i am at the botom poling baels on the elevater. this lakes about ten days for 12 ackers. the first day we cut, the next day we sare* corn, the next we tern* the straw, next day bael, and the next six we care, and the next to days we have to oil and gres the machins we used to go on to the next feald we got to oil and gres becous if we dinot the engen would get hot and some thing would go rong or the engen could blow up and that would sop us from cuting more corn. so it is most important to look at your musins. We have got to cut a feald of corn we have to get all the musunes to this field to go over this again so we half six field like this.  Words: 293
