I live in an old back dated house in **** boys. My name is ****. I am married with twins aged six-months. My wife and I have just finish doing up the house and are now starting on both back and front gardens. Me at the front she at the back and in a couple of weeks the whole piece of land should be perfect. My job isn't going too well and xxxx12.10/- * not very much to live on. My wife is trying to get a job and I am as well trying to get a more stable job of about xxxx20 a week. The cost of buying the house was not very much so we were lucky there. But we have a miny van and that takes some money away as well. Luckily the twins don't need much like cloths and food because they are only very small, but I think before I'm twenty six, I'll have a firm steady job and we'll be living in complete co*fort. We are saving madly to go on holiday this year as we haven't been away since our honey moon three years back At time we had some money and went to the baharmers for a month.  Words: 206
