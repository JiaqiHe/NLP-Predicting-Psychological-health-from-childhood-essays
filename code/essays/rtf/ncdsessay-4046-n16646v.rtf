I would share a flat with a girl freind. And I would be a short-hand typist in a big building. on saturday nights sometimes I would go out to the cinema or a night club. At home of an Evening I would wash my cloths and do the ironing. Then I would sit and watch televison or read. coming home from work I would buy a newspaper And read that of an Evening. I might not get maried until an older age. The wages that I get I will try to save. And then to maybe get a better job than what I already have. I would like to know one of two different languiges. And especially french. When I am 25 I might go and live in another country like new york or maybe germany. I would like to have a night out at the Bingo. once every Two weeks Pherhaps. And I would like to be a member of some sought of Club. The girl I share my flat with may even be one of my School freings. I could Imagine that would be very nice. So that I will know her very well and will be able to trust her. I would like to live in [London suburb] or [London suburb] even. My girl freind would be the same age as me.  Words: 225
