I would like to be a hairdresser and have my own shop. Later on I would get married to a nice man, I would have three children, two boys and one girl. I might live in a big house with a tennis court and * swimming pool. (If I have enough money) I like needlework so I would make all my clothes. I would own a Jaguaer and go out on saturdays and perhaps on sundays, the rest of the week I would go swimming. I might have a nursery for my children and for other children. I like reading so I would have a maginge* each week.  Words: 108
