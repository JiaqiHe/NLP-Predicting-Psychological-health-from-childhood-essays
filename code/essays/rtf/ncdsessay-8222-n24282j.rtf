I am very interested in animals, and keep a number of pets, including a dog and a tortoise. Every morning I catch a bus, to go to a primary school, where I teach, and in the evenings when I return from work, I enjoy watching television, reading, and talking with friends. If I find any spare time during week-ends. I make my own clothes, or go for walks in the country. I am always very busy. Some evenings, after school, I stay behind to supervise a number of clubs the children attend, such as netball and needlework clubs. I keep a blue budgie called (name), who likes a lot of attention, and my dog (name) is always ready to play. When i can find the time, I help out in the local (place) clinic. I go to (town) for my holidays, where one of my friends live, and I stay with this friend for a week, or sometimes two weeks.  Words: 160
