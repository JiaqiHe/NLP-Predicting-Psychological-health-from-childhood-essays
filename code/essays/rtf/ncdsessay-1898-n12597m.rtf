I would probarly have a job by now, I would like to work with a firm that designs fabrics. I would be a sales manager. I would use the firms car to travel to various other companys, I would give them samples of fabrics if they wanted to buy certain amounts of our fabrics. If I had any spare time off of my job, I would tkae up a hobby of either car-racing or model aeroplane desighning. If I could buy a cottage in the country and be a farmer. If I got married I would like to have have two boys and one girl. At home If my hobbies didn't work out I would buy a lot of painting equipment and paint pictures. I would either sell them or just keep them. Also if I had a garden I would probarly grow most of my own food.  Words: 148
