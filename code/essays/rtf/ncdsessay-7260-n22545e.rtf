At the age of 25 I would probaly have one or two children. Most likely* I owuld be going out to work. When I get home in the evenings I would have the housework* and an evening meal to make and the washing up from breakfast to do if I haden't already done it before I went out to work On Saturday's there would be the groceres for the next week to fetch, and the bakery to do. In the evening I would get a baby sitter and either go to the pictures or stay at home and watch television. On Sunday we would go to church in the morning and probably go out in the afternoon. My husband during the week goes* out to work comes home about 5.30, he then has his tea and goes and digs the garden or goes out in the car. On Saturdays he goes to work to, but on Sunday he takes us all out. in the car  Words: 165
