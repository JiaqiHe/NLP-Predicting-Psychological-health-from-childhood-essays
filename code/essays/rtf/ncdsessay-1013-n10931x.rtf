"I am now 25 years old, I work at a top model's salon' full time. In my spare time at home I like designing teenagers dresses. I am writing a book about fashion at the moment and every day when I am fed up with designing clothes I go up to the attic a sit by my lamp writing away. About a year ago I went for a trip around the world doing fashion shows. When I stopped at our first destination, Paris, my luggage got mixed up with that of a conjurer. When I opened the case out flew twoturtle doves and the both nestled in my hair. I vas very surprised and I rang the bell for my porter. He came running in and said ""Yes Missy"" I said ""What is the meaning of this?"" I pointed to the case. He said ""Me not know missy"". Later on we found the right case. After that we visited many more places such as Vienna, Tokyo, Uganda, New York, Los Angeles. I think the best of those places were Los Angeles. Now I am one of Britain's Top models and I hope when my book is finished I hope it wil be read by the public."  Words: 206
