I have just com ehome from work, and am sitting down in the chair of 52 [street name]. My husband is working at a motor cucle shop, I am working in fashion Parlour, my favourate hobby is swimming and I go every day.
At work I have a little shop all to myself in which I design dresses and clothes, I go to work at 8.30 am and have 1 1/2 hours for lunch then at 2 o'clock I get back to work until 4.30 pm then I do some shopping, get into my red sports car and drive down the road into the Strand and home again. 
I get home at 6 o'clock and, when I have had my tea I drive my husband and I to where [female name] and [male name]s house is then I pick them up and we go to staines swimming baths.
When we get there we get changed and stay in there for until 9.30 pm when the swimming baths close.
Then when we get home I watch the News at ten then Ig go to bed and wake up next morning at 7.30am and get ready for work.
I get to the Strand at 9.30 just in time for work.  Words: 204
