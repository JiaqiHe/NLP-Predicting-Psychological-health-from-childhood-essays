"I am now 25, my husband is 27 and I have one daughter 2 her name is [female name]. One day my husband came home from work and he said, ""I have thought of an idear would you like to emigrate to Austrialia"". ""Oh I'd love to."" So I went and told [female name] although she could'nt understand she looked very exited. My husband said,
""I will go and see if we can get fixed up"". That day I was so exited I gave [female name] a treat I told her that I would take her to see her granny. First I had to do the house cleaning first.
After dinner I gave [female name] a wash and put her best dress on. I thought this wasn't much of a treat but [female name] liked it because she got ice-cream when the ice-cream man came along the road. After we were ready we whent down to the bus station in town and I bought [female name] a bag of sweets and I got a Womans Own. At last after a few miles we got of the bus and found our way to granny's house. We rang the bell but nobody answerd we went round the back and on the door was a note which said,
""Please will you leave my two pints of milk the money is next door as I have gone shopping and will be back at 6 o'clock. [female name] started crying as she had had a big disapointment. When we got home I got her some ice-cream. Later my husband came home and said it was fixed for next week."  Words: 271
