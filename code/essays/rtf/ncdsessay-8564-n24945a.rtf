If I where 25, I would keep a small farm yard. Probably I would only have chickhens and ponies. My job would be teahing children to play the piano. Some people would think it boring, but I like the idea. I might be a ballet teacher instead because everyone says 'Your good at that' but I think that piano teaching will 'win'. It is a worthwhile living, and sixpence an hour's lesson with eight people aday is quite good. In my spare time I would do embroidery soft toys for children. If I married anyone it would be a sailor or someone like that. (I couldnt bear to have a husband hanging about the house!) I might have one or two children but no more. I'd be overrun with children, what with children of my own and piano pupils. I might breed rabbits and guinea-pigs for selling, and perhaps siamese cats. or long haired cats. Also I would like to keep a dog, a small breed like poodles. I would often go on seadide holidays abraud were it is 'always warm and sunny.' I woul travel in trains, and would not have a car.
