I am now twenty five years old and lead what seems to me to be a perfect life. My husband [name] works abroad and is extremely well paid I work park time in a small sweet shop, down the road from our cottage. We live on the verge of the countryside just outside a town. I am never bored as all my spare time is spent looking after my horse Firebird. He is a bright chestnut, with a white bla*e and a white sock. He needs over an hour's exercise everyday and he needs mucking out, feeding and grooming. His stall is behind the house, an old converted garage, the trees are scarce and the bare fields stretch away, seemingly forever. To the right the road wnids towards the town, a steep hedge on one side and a ditch on the other. Up on the left is the Riding school, one of the horses there, Joe Smoke, is continually taking oppurtunities to escape and trotting along the road to visit Firebird. He has to be led back on a halter each time! The cottage is biult of grey stone with a pink-bloomed creeper crawling up the walls. 
      In my spare time I enter my horse for the local gymkhanas. He is a reasonable jumper but has occasional bad spells. Once he rolled in a water jump, with me on his back! Now I have some sixty rosettes and three cups to adorn my bedroom. I could go on into great detail talking of my life but as Firebird has not been out, the dinner is on, and I have some washing up to do, I must fly!  Words: 278
