When I am twenty-five years old I will work either at a factory, or be a nurse. If I don't get either of the jobs I will try and work in a shop. When I am twenty-six I might get married. When I get married it will be to a man at the age of twenty-six, or twenty-seven. He will have dark hair and brown eyes. His name will be John. One day when we are married we will have a baby and either call it John or Julie. We will get a two-bedroomed house in [xxxxxxx]. It will have a living-room, a dining room, a kitchen, two bedrooms, and a bathroom. John will earn twenty-nine pounds a week. In the summer we would go on a holiday to New York for three weeks. One day [illegible] we bought a pet dog and we would keep it and live happily ever after.  Words: 152
