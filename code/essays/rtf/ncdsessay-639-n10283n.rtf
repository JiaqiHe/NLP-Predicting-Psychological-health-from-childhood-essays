I would get up about 6-30, get ready for work and get my bike, and go to work. when I get there I would see if the shop was open, if it wasnt I would get out my keys and unlock the door. I would turn the notice round. Then I would get ready for the first customer. After work i would go to the shop and buy some things, and then I would go home. I would get my tea and then go and do a bit of knitting.
At 25 I expect my hobbies will be cooking, knitting and quite alot more. At home I shall watch the television and do some knitting. I shall do some gardening and make my garden look nice. Maybe enter it in a flower show. Maybe I shall go on holiday in another country. I would like to live in a beautiful little cottage in the country.  Words: 154
