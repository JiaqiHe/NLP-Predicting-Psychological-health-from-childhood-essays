At the age of twenty five I am getting on very nicely. I am a hairdresser I have been in the buisness for 6 years I had three years training after I had left school I have been married five years. I have two children a boy and a girl they are both 3 years old they call them Tracy and Jonathon. We live in a bungalow at [town]. The girls and I go out to the pictures every Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Friday. The husband and I go out together on Thursday. Same with the husband he goes out with the boys on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Friday. Saturday and Sunday we stay intogether watching the television. I think that the best way to live you dont want to be stuck in the house with the husband all the time work in the day and rest at night. Every Monday I was Tuesday I iron and the rest of the week I do the hairdressing except Sunday thats when we all go out together we have a good dinner then we set off at about 12 oclock and go out for the afternoon we take our tea and come back at 6 oclock to put the kids to bed. Me and the husband go to bed at 1/2 past ten. We dont believe in late nights. I call my hairdressing Salon **** I dont work on Monday and Tuesday. We have my  mother for our babysitter.  Words: 247
