I am 25 years old. I am not maried. I have a very nice job I am a secutary. To a very nice man. After work I go dancing sometimes I go skiting, with my best friend. I help my mother with some work if I am not going out, and when I come from work.
My friend and I might move into this flat we have got our eye on. We will live there together. That is until we get maried. My friend has got no parents so that is one reason why we want to buy the flat.
We have decided to get some pets. We don't want a dog because it would have to be locked in the flat all day because we both go to work. We will be getting a cat I think because we both like cats. They are very easy to keep and you can just leave them outside all day.  Words: 156
