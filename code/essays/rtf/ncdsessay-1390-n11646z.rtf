I would have a bugalow to live in and it would have a lovely garden with a swimming pool for us. i would be a hair dresser at my own shop ***t to my own bugarlow. My child I would like to have would be a girl called (name) and she would go to a village school.
My interests would be *** my spare time, cooking fancy cakes for my childs tea, swimming in my own swimming pool and taking a large goldy coloured labredor dog. Out for a walk through the fields at the bottom of my garden.
The Hair dressers shop where I would work would open at 9.30 till 12' oclock from twelve oclock I would fetch my child from her school and take her to have dinner. Then at 1.30 the shop would open again until 5.30.
When I get home from the shop ,I would get the supper and sit down in the garden and enjoy the sun. In the winter I would sit by a log fire and do some knitting or sewing.
If my child had a party in the summer I would give it out in the garden with lots of sunshine.
When it was my twenty - fifth birthday I would give a party for my friends in the neighbour hood it would be at ight in the house. I would have lots of food and drink .
The swimming pool in my garden would be large and deep, An round the outside would be some trees and some tables and chairs. At the bottom of the garden there would be some plu* orchade as well as fields .  Words: 272
