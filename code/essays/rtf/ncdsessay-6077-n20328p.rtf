I am 25 years of age and I am trying to lead a desent life . I am interested in teaching and sports. I live in a quiet district and have many friends . If I were a teacher I would like to teach children at the age of ten . I would try to be patient with the children . As soon as the children came in I would give them one Set of mental arithmetic . On Friday mornings I would give them mathematic and on Friday afternoons I would give them drawing or painting. On afternoons of any other days of the week I would give english in the afternoon . Sometimes I would take the children out to play games . The boys would have football one day and the girls would have netball the next day. I would try to lead a good and an honest life. I am also interested in nature . If I was a teacher I would make a nature table in my class. I would like to live out in the country on a farm. If I had a chose of which animals I would like to have I would choose a collie dog. If I could not be a teacher I would like to be an athlet and I would like to swim a lot.  Words: 226
