----------------------
I am leading a good life and I am married. My husband is very good to me and I love him very much. I live in a lovely house well furnished. I have all the comforts that a wife could wish for. I like going out with my husband to partys and weddings. I also like giving partys myself for we have no children and we have the money. My husband is an engine driver and I work in an office as a secretary. My employers name is Mr. [name]. He is a very nice man and gives me quite a bit of money for the job that I do. I earn 20 pounds a week. If I stay later every night I get a bonus of 7 pounds a week which I think is very good. I like the job I do and I would never give it up except if I had children. But I think it will be a couple of years before I have one. I have a home help who does my house work for me. I think she is very good and I would never sack her. My house is in a road quite near to where I work. It is a modern house with modern things in it. I am very glad I live there for my sister only lives next door with my mother and her husband and also little [name] my neice. My father was killed a couple of years ago. he was in a car crash. I have got a lovely house a good job and a husband and I am very happy indeed. I could not wish for a better live than I have now.  Words: 286
