I would lead my life by nusing sick people, my interests are reading and dancing, at home I would help my parents and other people that I new in the road. If I was married I would help my husband and children, I would do my best for my family. I would give my children the best education I could, I would try to be on time to the hospital. I would do my best for older people. My work would be as good as I could do. I would like to own a car, quite big, and a few horses, and a dog a Bassat hound.  Words: 107
