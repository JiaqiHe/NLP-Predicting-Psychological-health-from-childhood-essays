I enjoy my life very much indeed. I work at Portsmouth on a large liner. My work is curing ill people on the ship, including healing the sailors. I work for the Queen Alexanders Royal Navel Nursing Corps. My interests are swimming in the very warm sea. Every week I send a letter to my parents, expaining what I am feeling like. Sometimes I send them a little gift, like a sovenier of my ship. My rank is staff-nurse. I did my training in a London General Hospital. When I was training my salary was xxxx50 a month. Now my salary is about xxxx70. It mostly varies, it just is down now. We are going to land in a moment. When we do land we will be at Africa.  Words: 129
