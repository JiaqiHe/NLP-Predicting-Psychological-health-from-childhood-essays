The oldest is a boy and he is 10 the second youngest is a girl and she is 8 and the youngest is a boy and he is 3 months. I come home from work and then I take my coat off and then I sit down and have my tea with the family we have a chat with each other about different things when we have had tea we watch tb. Sometimes we go out together somewhere. Today we are going out we get in the car and start off on our way. I drive the car into the country we have brough picnic things so we stop in the country and set the picnic out when we have finished we go a few miles further along the road near way we are in the car to see what is around if there is nothing we start on our way home.
