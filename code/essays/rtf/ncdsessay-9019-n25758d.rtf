I have a rambling old world house in deep country surrounded by only pleasant woods and wide heathered moors and a tumbling burn with a glisttenning waterfall used as a jump by salmon and trout, a swirling pool maked by clumps of lush green reeds and heather is a sort of wild outdoor sancturary for the birds such like the heron and kingfisher and reed warbler, a home very wquiet for relaxing after flying test planes and protypes new from the drawing board. Interesting waterbirds and wild rockshacks are quiet regular visitors to my water-folk and the salmon can be seen jumpin the waterfall in great crowds in the mateing and spawning season, I take great interest in studying this animal life.
I have other pastimes hobbes and interests such as making radio controlled model aeroplanes playing football and cricket. 
My work is a test pilot as a have already told you and it is a dangerous enjoyable job I have had quite some close shaves such as one when test the brand new* AZI the engine cut out and I had to glide tremendously fast and crash in a river near the airfield luckly the water wet the spark plug and put out the risk of fire and explosion.
At the age of twenty-five I have had thirty-five flight and three mishaps. I also have fun and much injoyment fishing and spending my holidays eating salmon and trout. near my home the english boader stands* and a lake is about a mile througt the woods and moors to a small valley which a build a small hut and I have a camera and cinecamera to film the life their near the water I have made a boat with camat***ie *o to drift and film some reed warblers and herons fishing* their way.
