I am a footballer for Sheffield United and I live in a small village called [village]. I am married and have a boy and a girl. I also work as a part-time shop assistant, and in the free time I get I coach a boys team which includes my son [name] who is 7. Our house is detached with a kitchen, lounge, dining room, four bedrooms, a bathroon and a playroom for the the children. The little girl who is called [name] is five years old. For holidays we visit my parents and my wifes parents every year we also go to the lake district every year. I train every day except Thursday and Sunday. In summer I play cricket for Yorkshire. I often go abroad to play matches. I get paid well and we are never bothered by taxes or bills. My wife and the children never miss a home match. When I retire from football I hope to be a manager and if that is not possible I would like to become a full-time shop assistant. I have an expensive camera and often use it. My children go to the same school and are getting on well.  Words: 199
