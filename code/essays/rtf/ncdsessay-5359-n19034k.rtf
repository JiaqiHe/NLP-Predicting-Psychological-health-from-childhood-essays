I am an Engineer and I am working in a factory. I have chosen this job because I like working with my hands and making thinges especialy finding out how things work. I have a little car to go to work in as I live on the outskirts of a busy town. I may even go abroad with my job to other countrys to see how other people work and live and may even go the moon. England is now getting crowded so I might decide to live abroad. I have several hobbies which are:- Fishing, boating, flying and swimming. I live in a nice house with my family and we have one or two pets.  Words: 116
