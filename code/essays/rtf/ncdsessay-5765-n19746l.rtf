I am 25 years old and I am a batchlur living buy my self. I work in a ionmongers shop at [town]. I own the shop and it closes at Half-past six p.m. when the shop is closed at night I go up the house which is furcher away from the shop. I have got a car which I go up from the shop in and go away in to differant places. When I am at home I do thing to ockupie myself. I make my own* dinner and tea. When I clear the table I wash the thing out. When I have finished a clearing the things up I sit down to watch the television for the rest of the night or sometimes I go out for a drink. when it is about twelv-oclock I switch the television-visicon off. and go to bed. My latest night* is Saturday because I stay up and watch the football on television. I get up at half-past eight, and go down to the shop for nine-o-clock again.  Words: 174
