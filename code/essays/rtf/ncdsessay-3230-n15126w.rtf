I would be living with my mother and father and would be working in a hairdressers shop. I would stay had home most nights I would most likely have a horse by this time. I will spend my spare time looking after my horse and riding it. I would also take my mum and dad out on sunday afternoon's. I would not be married because I do not want to get married. I would go on hoildays to jersy with my mum and dad because I like jersy because it is a quite place for my mum and dad.  Words: 99
