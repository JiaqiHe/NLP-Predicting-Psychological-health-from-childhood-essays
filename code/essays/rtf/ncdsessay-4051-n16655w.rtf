I am now a fully grown man of 25 year I have just got up, and the baby is crying. I need a shave badley and I might be late for work I have now changed my job and I now work in a office when I go to work I collect **** bus before I joined the office I used to play football. I had my shave and I am eating my breakfast and a cup of tea on the way I sing songs and whistle, I am now in my office working and filling in my papers. I take a break for lunch and then carry on filling in papers. When I finish work I go home and do the garden its a nice big one and I often play football when I have spare time but I have to do the garden or the grass will grow long and the flowers will die. When I finish doing the garden I go in doors and read the paper while I am having tea. After tea my wife and I sit and talk to gether while the television is on. and when the whole of the television is off we go to bed, and sometimes I have dreams about what I do when I am in the office but when the next day comes everything happens over again. on wednesday I get half day and I come in and take the family out for lunch and while we are out we go to the fun fare and I let the kids go on things they want to go on when we get back the wife gives them there tea and puts them to bed and we have out tea and watch the television and then due too go to bed.
