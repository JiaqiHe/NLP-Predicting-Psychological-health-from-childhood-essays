I work at [football ground] selling programs and collecting money at the turnstiles when I sell the programmes it is my responsiblity. Because if there is'nt all of the programes money or there is not any left over I must pay for the missing money. My home life is boring on Monday night unless there is a football match on, on tuesdays it is not so bad because theirs sometimes a football match on and if not I go down to are local club on wednesday and thursday it is boring but on Friday I go down to are pub and on Saturday I mostly go to work if the first team plays away well we usualy change the reserves or sell programmes.
