I wake up in the morning feeling glad that it is another working day. I work in the arcutecturebuissness and I enjoy it very much arcetecture is a very good job because we design houses.
My home is a very nice bunglow because it has two big windows and central heating.
I still collect stamps but my pet died years ago and I do not have time to watch televison or listen to the wireless.  Words: 73
