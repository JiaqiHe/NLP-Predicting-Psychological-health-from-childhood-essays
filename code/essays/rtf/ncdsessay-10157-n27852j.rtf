I would go out to work evry day at a block of offices as a secutary. AT the week-ends I would read some of my book and do some cooking, washing and drawing. I got up one Monday morning and got dressed and slipped over as I walked down the stairs. I switched on the eletric cooker and had my breakfast. Then I put my coat and hat on, picked up my typewriter and went to the office block. The man in charge took me to his office and told me to get my pad out. I wrote out letter after letter it was 10 o'clock before i'd finished. I typed out the letters until 12 o'clock and then went home for dinner. All afternoon I typed until 5 o'clock and went home for tea. In the evening I went out to a club with my boyfriend. It was 1 o'clock before I came back.
At the week-ends I read a book. Sunday morning I went to church when I came back I did some washing and cooking. Sunday afternoon I had a phone call from the office telling me to go to the airport to fly to Austrailer.  Words: 198
