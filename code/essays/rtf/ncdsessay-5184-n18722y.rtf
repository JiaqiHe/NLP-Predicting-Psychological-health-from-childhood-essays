I have first been told that I have been accepted to go to University where I hope that I may learn more than the collage has done. For me Nearly scince I had past to go to collage. I had wanted to go to University. This came as a surprise f*or Mr. [name] as well as myself. Mr. [name] had made me study hard. The surprise came just after my 25th birthday party. I had been studying science in all my spare time. Mr. [name] said I shall be a science teacher if I should pass for schooling. Now I am in a class for people who wish to be come teachers. I have to go on for one whole year then set my first year exam. Although a year seem's not far away I think it is like waiting for a millon years. I hope to go to Africa to teach. That is if I pass as a teacher. My mother keeps writing letters with postal orders in. With my room mate who is always writing to her boyfriend I hardly ever get time to get hold of the writing paper my friends have asked me to go to the dance but I reafused because I still have to Pass my exam. Six months have already past and I am still studying for the first exam. When I have past all exams for teaching I will go to work in Africa for to teach the Children there. But I will always write to my parents. I might even get married.  Words: 261
