It is my 25th birthday and I have two children I am leading a good life. I have some interests like collecting stamps in my odd time. I also like makeing models which fly. I listen to a lot of radio and watch television. I do not spend as  much time as I used to at the cinema because television has taken is place. My house is a four bedroon house it has a sun deck a swinning pool at the back and a big garden to play in. My two sons have a model railway. I spend most of my time helping them with they railway. My Job is a railway drive but I have not driven a train on my own. But by the end of the year I sould have start to drive a train on my own. [name] and [name] do not go to school yet but they will next year. We have got a good school for them. It is soon time for us to go on or holiday this year we are going to Wales. We all 'ways enjoy our holidays because there is always a lot to do. Last year I came home and I was nearly brok, because I had spent so much money and this year I hope I do not do the same thing.
