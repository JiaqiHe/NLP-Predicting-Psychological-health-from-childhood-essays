I work in a design centre, designing curtains, carpets and many otherthings. I was married at the age of twenty three and now have one child. Just now I am taking driving lessons and I hop* to pass my test which is in four days time. I like cooking and reading in my spare time. We usually go to (place) for our holidays as we have friends there . From Monday to Fridays I usually have my lunch in town, and in the evenings I leave the design centre about five oclock, and as I live rather far away, I don't get home until about six oclock .
