When I am 25 I hope to be able to go out more often in my daily life, I hope to have lots of friends. I like baking cakes and going out If I do have a small family I hope to be able to do quite a lot in the house. I hope to have acheived alot when I an 25, I hope to be genorous and Kind to my friends. I think I would have a job of a shop assistant hair dresser or a Nurse. I haven't quite made up my mind or I might go and study at a college, to be a teacher. There is so much I would want to do if I could. At home I would help my mother alot to wash up * sew clothes if torn. I would go out to the cinema to watch a picture on my own if I was bored in the house. I would quite a lot of new clothes and a small room for myself where I could sit. and read or draw pictures from books. Those are most of the things I can think of to do when I an 25 years of age.
