When I grow to be 25 I would like to be a nurse or a childrens Nurse. I am not married and I work as a Nurse somtimes I go out with boys and enjoy myself in other ways too. One Tuesday after noon we were asked if any one would  want to go and look after two children until they were a lot older and I volonteered. There was a girl called [name] aged 1 and a boy called [name] aged 3 they were nice children and it was a pleasure to look after them. When they were older [name] was 7 and [name] was 5 I made them a small tree house in there back garden. But then I heard that there mother was going to have another child it was a girl named [name] I was very rushed and busy then trying to look after the baby help [name] with a picture and bathing [name]'s leg where she had fallen over all at the same time. [name] grew very fast and so did [name] and I wasn't bothered by them very often and [name] would soon be old. I knew that the hard part would come when I had to leave them it would be heart braking still I had to leave somtimes. When did finally leave them I went away to Australia there I got married and had two children of my own I had too give up my job to look after my own children so we bought a farm. The life was good but had we had to rise* at 5 oclock in the morning but nobody minded The children were happy and liked the new life  Words: 283
