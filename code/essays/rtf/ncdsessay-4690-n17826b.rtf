I am now twenty five years old and a pilot in the R.A.F. At the RAF station we are flying the new supper phantom's I live in the married quarters on the station and married to a blonde Amarican girl. 
     Every morning at half past four someone plays the taps on the bugle and at six oclock we are told to get up to do our dalily excersizes which I find not too plesent. 
     I am a wing commander in charge of 13 squadron which are equiped with phantom's and sea hawkes. These planes are equiped with rockets and heavy c*nnons. 
     My wife is a WAF and has got a baby boy of twenty months. His name is Mark David and we usually call him Mark though I prefere David. 
     When I was training to be a pilot one of my close freinds got called after his seavixen went into a nose dive and blow blow up. After that I nerly lost my courage to fly again. After a couple of years of hard training I was fully qualified as an R.A.F. phanton pilot. 
     Another catastr*fy rumbled up after a seavixen blew up while taking off. It happened when the port under carrage brook and so it tiped over blew into peaces. 
     There are six squadrons on the station 15, 1*8, 5, 28, 92 and my owen* sqadron.  Words: 234
