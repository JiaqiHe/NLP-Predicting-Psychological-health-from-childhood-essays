Being a pilot is no easy job, you fly long distances and long working hours, and sometimes you are on standby, which means that you will come whenever you are wanted. I am married and have to boys called [male name] and [male name] after me. My wife is called [female name] and we have been married for two years now. She is twenty four years old.
My instrests in life are Model Railways, Airlines, Woodwork and Engineering. I enjoy my home life and to rest when I come home from work. I like playing cards games and greatly enjoy watching a football match, on Televison or going to the match. The football team which I support is a London club called Arsenal. I had moved about quite a bit in my childhood but now I had settled down with my wife both near her and my parents. I like being a pilot because it is an intresting job and you good holidays and you get payed well. There's a risk infolded but I usualy foreget all about it. When-evere I go to a football the wife aways ask me if they can come to. I nearly aways say yes as she is so kind to the boys and me and is aways hard working. I do not no what team she supports because I have never asked. Whenever we get a chance to go out, we aways get our next door nebours dauter to come and look after them for us.  Words: 251
