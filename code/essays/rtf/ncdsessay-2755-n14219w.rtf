I am now twenty-five. I am living at my own house with my husband and daughter. I am a nurse and I have to get up at half past six and take my daughter to my mothers. Then I catch the bus to the hospital. I change into my uniform and go to the childrens ward. I go and see that they are all right. Some times one of them will be awake and say hallo. nurse. I then go and prepare their breakfast witch is usually a glass of milk and cornflakes or wheatabix. Then I go and wake them up. I bring their breakfast in on a trolly. I give out the breakfast and go and have mine then I go and collect their breakfast things I wash them up and leave them to drain I then go and see if their are any visitors. usually their is. If any child hasn't got a visitor I go and keep him or her company. The bell rings at the end of visiting time and everybody leaves. I go and see the children and make sure their beds are comfortable. I go and see that the cook has got their dinner ready then I take it round to the children. I have mine then collect the dirty dinner plates. I go and tidy up the beds. and make sure the children are comfortable. The doctor comes round the childrens ward. I then go and take of my uniform and leave. I catch the bus and collect my daughter. and take her home.  Words: 262
