When I am 25 I hope to be a hairdresser. I want to be a hair dresser because I think they have an interesting job. I would not have a shop of my own I would work for someone. If I could I would mostly do childrens hair. I think it would be useful to be a hair dresser because then I could do my own childrens hair and not have to pay for them to have to pay for them to have it done. In my spare time I would teach my children how to do hair.  Words: 98
