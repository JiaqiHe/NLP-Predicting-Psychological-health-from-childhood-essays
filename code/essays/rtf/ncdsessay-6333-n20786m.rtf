IF I was twenty five years old. I would work in the army or N**** I would fire Guns or paracut from the sky about five miles up and have my Gun with me just in case the enemy came and took me prisoner and most of all hand-Granaudes. If I was the navy I would fire m*chne - Guns were sailors clothes and work in the engine room or work on deck with the other sailers and learn about sailing if I were on a boat it would be a fighting boat. OR I might work no fishing pipes where my dad works OR I might work at (company) were my mum works to be a secertery. O* work as a teacher as (name) our teacher, or as a Headmaster like (name) ours. or I might not work at all.  Words: 141
