I am a newspaper reporter, my main interests are driving. photography. I have just finished studying and at the moment I am only reporting for a small local newspaper. I am not yet married but I have a house of my own. I have to do all my own cooking. I am engaged. and will soon get married. I am hoping to be promoted to editor soon, as he is soon retiring. Normally I get a card with the important events to be covered. If there are none I am placed on half pay and if I do report on something I find I get full pay for the day. I will then get married and have some children.  Words: 119
