When I am twenty five I would like to sing pop songs I do not like opera it is boaring I stay with my mother she is very good to me but I am saving up for to buy a house whitch I will need lots of money I have been saving up since I was 17 years old I would like to live near the sea. I get 30 poun a week I give my mother 20 poun a week she buys most of my clothes. I love animals we have a monkey its name is (name) she is very clever. If I didnt manage to sing I would like to be a actress. I work from 8 oclock in the morning to half past 4 at the college. I like going for walks into the country to see nature I enjoy swiming in my spare time at the baths.  Words: 151
