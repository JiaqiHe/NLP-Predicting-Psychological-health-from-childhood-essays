"I am twenty five years of age , I live in the Borders of (place), and I am married, I live in a house with my wife and children my house is near (place). It is a country house but I live on a farm. My Job is a vet and I have passed all my exams. I through it would be handy to live on a farm if I was a vet because if the farmer needed any urgent calls from the farmer I would always be availible.
When I woke up one morning I found that my wife had gone down to make the breakfast. So I got dressed and went down stairs . I found that my wife was still in her dressing-gowns ""oh"" she said I've just made the breakfast so you *an sit down and eat. I had porridge , then fish fingers and tomato sause, and then finaly I had some oatcakes and a piece of toast . Just as I was finishing my piece of toast the telephone rang , it was one of these new telephones that we had got but I don't know why and my mother always likes the telephones that you have to just life the reciever . Anyway I answered it and who was on the other end but the farmer , he said ""could you come over quickly because one of my horses called (name) has just got some ****** which ***** him to lie and roll on the ground , but he has only done it twice but it is hard to **** upright."" ** quickly I came over in the car and came into the stable to see what was the matter ""well I said I think he needs to be put on a diet so I have him **** then I fed the horse I said give him it twice a day for three weeks so that **** that fixed.
Later on in the evening I had to deal with pets in my surgery in (place) later I came home to had a good supper then ti**** I went to bed ."  Words: 356
