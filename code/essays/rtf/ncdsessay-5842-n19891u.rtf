I am married and have two childeren at the age of 2 + 3 years. I have a job as a librairian in the afternoon. My husband works as a television renter. The children, [name] and [name] go to the nursery and I collect them every day at 12--30 am. I do not work at weekends so I go shopping in the morning and bake in the afternoon. On sundays I go to church with the children and on the afternoon we go out. The childeren don't like to be fussed about and so they play in the garden all day. I knit cardigans and jumpers for my family and I go swimming once a week. Being a librairian is not hard. I earn xxxx18. a week and my husband earns xxxx20. a week. He takes [name] fishing on Saturdays. I sell the fish and put the money towards a new house. We put xxxx5. in the bank each week and have now got xxxx95. We need another xxxx15. yet. [name] comes shopping with me when I go. Every Wednesday we all go to grannies and sometimes we go to the market at [town]. Our house is small with a large garden out the back. It has 5 rooms. Two bedrooms, one living room, one kitchen and a bathroom. The house we are saving for is a large house with a large garden at the front an a small one at the back.  Words: 243
