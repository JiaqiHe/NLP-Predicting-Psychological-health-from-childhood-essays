"When you are this age there is one third of your life gone. You will be married or getting ready to be married. If you are married you could be having a child at this age. Most of us will be having cars or scooters to ride in and on the scooters. I would like to be a football er and in the summer, I don't know what I'll do but I will think of a job to occupy myself and get money. If I don't become a footballer I will always be watching my favourite team ""[town] Rovers"". If I can't see it out side I'll be watching football on television. At twenty five you should be leading a very happy life. There should hardly be a care in the world for you. Most people are usually all right because they after Monday because they usually dread going to work on a Monday morning because they usually like a longer weekend than that what they all ready get. When I or we go on out holiday I think a foreign country would be nice like Majorca or Southern Italey. We would live in a big bungalow near the coast."  Words: 200
