"I have just left college and have found a job. It is to train and break-in horses which I like doing. The manager is called Mr [surname], and he is very good with horses.
I open the door of the flat I am to live in while I have this job. It has a few cups and rossetes on the walls and the shelves. I have unpacked my case and I'm now going down to meet Mr and Mrs [surname] and the horses. I am very excited. Mr [surname] has taken me out to see the horses and I am now outside an enormous paddock with about twelve enormous houses in!
I love working at this job especially as it in in the open air and not in a stuffy office with cigarette smoke every where. It is hard work training the horses, but they are improving quite a lot. Today I am lungeing them on the lungeing reins. After I have done this for about half an hour on each of them I begin to rather weary. I am now inside the flat drinking a hot cup of cocoa that Mrs [surname] made for me When I feel refreshed I go out to the horses again and train them more.
Two years have passed and I am still working at the same job. I sit on my bed and read the newspaper. There is a grand show on Saturday and I am going to take the horses in for it.
I have taken the horses in for it, and my favourite horse ""Star"" has won the cup. I am never going to stop working here as I like it too much to leave."  Words: 280
