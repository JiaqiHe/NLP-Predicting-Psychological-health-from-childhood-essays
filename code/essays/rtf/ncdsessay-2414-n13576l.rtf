I am studying very hard because I am in my final year at Strathclyde. I would like to be a Charter Accountant. On Saturday afternoon I play tennis at Jubilee path tennis Club. 
I am intrested in setting up a firm of Charter Accountants. My other interest is tinkering with my 14 year old Austin Maxi it only cost me xxxx30, but when new would have cost xxxx1,089 19s 11d. Tonight I am going to the drive in Cinema via the M.123 which leads to Cumbernauld and then I will go for  a run on the trans-Scotland Mono-rail for cars.
Tomorrow is Polling day and I am going to vote S.N.P. but I think the Liberals will still be in power. In a weeks time I will go to see the World Cup final at Hampden where Scotland verses Spain in Scotland are the favourites.  Words: 144
