I am married with two children, my work is a technical engineer, designing aircrafte for the R.A.F. I have a bungalo in (town) which has a nice big garden. I have many hobbys and often go fishing with my wife and children. Among other things I like to build petrol engined aroplanes and fily them on a big field near our house. At the moment we are haveing our home decorated inside and outside. Going back to my work. I have just designed a new plane made for vertical take-off. It is a stream wi*ed craft with all the new gadets and devices on it. My children are twins and are two years old. At home I like to paint and to sketch land-scapes. Just recently I painted a picture and sold it for twenty five pounds ten shillings at an art dealers. My wife likes to sketch better than paint and she can do some very nice sketches. I am very happy on the way wages I am earning and I get quite enoug to support my family and have enough to save and put away for the holidays. Soon we are hoppin to go to the Canary Islands for a holiday.  Words: 203
