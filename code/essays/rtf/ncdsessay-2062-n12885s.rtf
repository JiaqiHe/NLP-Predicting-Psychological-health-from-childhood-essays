When I am twentyfive I would like to have two or three children. A private house or a council house if I can not aford a private one. I would lielx like to have a husband with a good job, and who will not mind looking after children if I have to go out. When the children get a little older I would like to put the children in a nusrey, so I can be a part time teacher to get a little more money, so if we get a private house it will help to pay for it. I will have a bed time for all the children. Also have a proper feeding time for them. If the childen cry I will leave them crying for a while, but if they dont stop crying I'll just go upstairs and get the one that is crying give the child a bottle and after that put he or she a bed. again. If I can help it I don't want any of my children to have a dummy, because sometimes you can't get it off them and they go round the streets with it when they are five. If you can't get it off the child you might see them going to school with it in thier mouth, and it is not a very nice thing to see. When they go to school I would like them to stay at school for the dinners, so I can do full time work exept for a few hours in the morning to do my house work an do the shopping and other thing a married woman has to do. When the children get to about nine or ten years of age to do little jobs for me like washing the dishes and thing like that.  Words: 302
