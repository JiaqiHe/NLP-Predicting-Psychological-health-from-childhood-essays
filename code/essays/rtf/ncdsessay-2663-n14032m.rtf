When I leave secondry school I would like to go to collage to learn to be a teacher as I like looking after children i like arithma-tic but not as much as History I would not give the belt I whould give them lines to do . I whould like to be an ifant teacher as infant's aren't as cheeky as the older ones and I do not like cheeky children . I like reading as well . If I donot make a teacher I would like to be a nurse in a hospital again I ****** like children i would like to be in a child's ward . If I did not make either of them I do not no what I will be as these are my best hobbies .  Words: 132
