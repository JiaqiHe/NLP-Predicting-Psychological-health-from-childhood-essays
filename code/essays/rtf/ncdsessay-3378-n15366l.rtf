To day I am twenty five , I work as a hairdresser and my name is (name). I live with my mother and father , I am not married or engaged . I have a brother and sister. I when at home like to read books and magazines and look after my brothers baby who is one year old . I have got quite a few friends who come to the pictures with sometimes. Working as a hair dresser sometimes can be q***te tiring when you are on your feet most of the time.making peoples hair nice . The bit I hate about being a hair dresser is that when people with wigs drop in to leave their wig to get it permed , is that when they go you have to take the wig out of the box and their is an awful smell of some tipe of oil that comes of the wig . Well that enough of that lets take about what happens at home . When I come home from work I have my supper after which I sometimes do my mothers hair if needed if not I sart to read a book or magazine . I always go to bed early as I think it is good for my health . There is realy hardly any thing good on the television to watch know a days well that is all I can tell you about my live .
