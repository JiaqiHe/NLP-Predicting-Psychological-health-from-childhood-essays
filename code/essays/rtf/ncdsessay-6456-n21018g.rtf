I travel all around the world as my job is a Air hostise. My age is 25 and
My age is 25 and my operation* is a journerlist. With this job I travel round the world (story after) chasing story AFTER STORY. I am not married but I am going steady with a boy who works in the same office. I share a flat with my friend because THE PAPER I have to work WITH IS IN the heart of [city]. I get xxxx26 a week and they pay for my expences. I help at a horse riding stable in my spare time and also go swimming. I am following the research about the men who have landed on the moon and hope my job will make it possible for me to pay it a visit (I don't think I've got a chance though.)
I have one horrible experience IN MY JOB when the story I was following involed a murder. I found Mrs [name] the lady killed in her bed battered to death. Also I had a funny experience* when [name] tricked my boyfriends mate out of Five pound. I didn't know if he got it back.  Words: 213
