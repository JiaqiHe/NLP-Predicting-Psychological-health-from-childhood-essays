I am leading a happy live, with a small family. With two girls and two boys. My interests are cooking, pot plants and swimming. I am living in Cambridge. My house is a banglow with a small back and front garden. I would not mind a car, but the car i would like is a jag. My husband works at the post office. The childrens names would be Sachn, Mere, Deal, and (i)igele*. All my children will go to sunday school. I do not mind the house work also the children would make there own bed's, my home shall be in a quit street, The pets i shall have will be a colly.  Words: 113
