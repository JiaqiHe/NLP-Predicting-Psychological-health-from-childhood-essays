----------------------
I live in a small house in the country and am married with one baby. I have a very large garden half of which I use for my pony. Every morning before breakfast at about seven thirty I go for a walk with my dog and sometime's my baby.
On weekdays at about nine o'clock I drive down to the vets surgery to work. On Saturdays I start work at eight o'clock and every day I come home at six thirty in the evening. I have a home help in every day to look after the baby and get meals. After my evening meal I take my pony for exercise while my husband I who doesn't ride take's the dog for a walk. In the evenings I usually watch television or visit friends who all live at least one mile away. On Sundays I usually go out for drives through the county with my family and dog and I often go pony riding with my friend while her husband and mine go fishing. Sometimes we all meet up and have a picnic and swim in a nearby stream. My dog and baby usually go in the car with the two men. The vets surgery is in a small village so I get quiet a few patient, pets and animals from the nearby farm.  Words: 222
