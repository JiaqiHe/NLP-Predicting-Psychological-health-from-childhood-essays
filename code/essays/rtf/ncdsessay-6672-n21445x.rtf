Today I'm twenty-five. I work in a bank I like it very much. When I go home at niight I watch the television if there is nothing interesting on I read books or do knitting. At the moment I'm saving up to take my mother and father on hboliday. Sometimes when I come home from work I go out with my friends. My hobbies are reading, writing, knitting, swimming and doing competitions. I often go shopping for my mother. When I get bored in our house I take my dog for a walk he usualy comes shopping with me. At my work I have got lots and lots of friends they are all very nice. I have a dinner break and then I go to the cafeteria just up the road. There I stay until it is time foir nme to go back to work. Sometimes I take sandwiches to work with me so then I dont have to leave work for my dinner.  Words: 164
