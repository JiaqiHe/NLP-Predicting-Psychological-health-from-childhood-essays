I am (would) (be) working there as a shop asstint it is (would) (be) open every day ecept sunday, it is (would) only (be) open until two o'clock. I am (would) (be) working there for a long time and I (would) am (be) very happy. (there.) When I was small I wanted to be a nurse but I have changed my mind now. When I get back home from work it is nine o'clock then I would get changed then go to dances sometimes. Ever since I was ten and a half years old I wanted to be a shop asstant and now I am. There is two other shop asstints working with me and every day we get a lot of people coming in and buying things it is really a nice shop and it is quite big. The shop is in Newcastle and when I was eleven years old I used to pass the shop and used to say that is the shop I a would like to work in when I get bigger. and that is the shop I am working in now. and I am always happy when I get there because it is a lovely shop. The other two asstints are nice as well and they are very kind and very happy the same as me. It is like a happy family. and we never fight and the customers are nice and very kind. and come every day and buy some things to take home, for there meals.  Words: 287
