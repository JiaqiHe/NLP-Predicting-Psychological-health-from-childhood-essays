I am an air-hostess. I work on the (company) aeruoplanes. I started that when I was 25 years old. I thought I would be that because I wanted to travel round the world. I have already been to australia, Canada,and many more place so many I cannot remember them. My interests are , swimming , sewing reading adventure stories , playing the recorder. I do not have much home life as an air-hostess *s away all the time. but when i get a chance I come home to see my mother, father, brothers, sisters. When i get home I only stay about two weeks and go away again. I come home about twice a year and I am very glad about it.  Words: 122
