I live in a sevon roomed house near the seaside I am a joiner and have a rolls royce. Every day I get up at 6 o'clock and go to work in an old car, because I do not want to ruin my best car. I have got four children, two boy and two girls. On Saturday I take the children down to the beach. On Sunday all the family go to visit my mother. We go to Spain for our holidays. The house we live in has got a large garage. We have a large aquarium in which we keep all sorts of tropical fish. A lot of the things in the house are home made, such as the wall cabinet and the shelves. My interest in life is sailing. I own a speed boar a cruiser and a yatch. I play for the local football team. I play on the forward line. At night I usualy watch the television or play cards.  Words: 164
