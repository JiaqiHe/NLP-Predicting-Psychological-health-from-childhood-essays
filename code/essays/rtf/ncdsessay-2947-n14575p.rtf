I would like to be married, and have two children, one* medion sized car, and a house out in the country with a lot of money in the bank. Also I would like to be a proffesional football, I would like to play for Sunderland since I was born there, and play for England. I like football because I like to join* in games, and it is something to do, it makes you well known and may be famous* all over the world. You make friends with other people. like the manager and players for the football club. Whilst I am not playing football I would buy a greengrocer shop and look after that. I would have to buy things like lettuce tomatoes etc. and pay the people who work there. All of this is to save money to raise the family, and buy birthday peresents and christmas* presents, to pay tax and rates, and for food and keep the house going, and best of all keep the family happy.
