I work in a bird watching assoiation we go out on trips to watch birds of England, Wales, and Scotland. Sometimes we go to Africa, to watch many other gay and colourful birds. We go to sience musems in allparts of the world, we bring back soverneirs of these birds we see. I live in a flat by myself I go to this club just down the road. I meet up with some of my pals later on we go to my flat for super and we play records of the old fashioned hit parade. We meet again the next night the same place Sometimes they come on trips with me to Aftica one day we saw a strange bird I looked it up but it was not in the book anywhere. So we went and got the telescope, it was white, green, blue, with a red beak. Later that month I went back to England and we never saw that bird agaian. It was five fifteen that night when I shoot that bird it drop like a stone from the sky. I studied it closely for a week then took it to the sience meusem in London, I recieved xxxx120 for this bird. It was looked up in an ensicloapidia and its name was African Dodo it was a bird that was found in the ice in the Great African salt mine just of south west africa. The feathers are a symbol of an ancient God, called Cropdised.  Words: 249
