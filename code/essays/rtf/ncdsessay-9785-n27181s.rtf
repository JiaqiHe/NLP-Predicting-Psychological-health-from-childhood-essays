The Life I am Leading is great because I am in the aprenticeship that I wanted to be in. Engineering is the job that I am in unlike many others being an Engineer offers a lot of different jobs such as one day you may be told to out some Steel the next day to help build a bridge. At home I do a lot of Jobs on the car for instance lighten the fan belt put new cylinders in and stuff like that. The bigest Job is when I strip the engine down on the car. The bigest interest of mine is engines - diesel steam electric or Petrol. Electric engines you can get Quiet and big.  Words: 118
