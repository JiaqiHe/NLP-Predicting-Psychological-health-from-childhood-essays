When I am twenty five I will get married I will have a white wedding. I will earn my living as being a nurse as I always wanted to be one. I will have two children and I shall want a boy first and then a girl. I would want their names to be [male name] and [surname] if my husband would let me. In my Job I  would want to be on duty from nine two to two aclock in the morning, because I wouldn't miss my children so much. When I had learnt quite alot at being a nurse I hope I would be able to go in a sergary because you get more money, but you have to work more earlyer in afternoon and you have to work longer but that is the only way I could earn my living. When I was older I would want to live the Job incase I did something wrong when I was operating on won of the patiant's. And when I had left the Job I would want to have a good time.  Words: 183
