Twenty five today read the card on the mantlepiece, with a few presents from the children round it, [female name] two and a half and [female name] three. Thanking my wife for them I started my brackfast. Quickly finishing it I checked that I had every thing before I went to work, in the observatory. Saying cherio to the kids I went to the garage by the side of the house pulling out the keys I unlocked it going inside and there was my car, a Vauxhall Vivor unlocking the door I drove off heading for the observotary.
This will probably be my daily routine at the age of twenty five.
I hope to be an astronomer and my ambition is to write a book fiction non-fiction or reference for some child, like myself now, to read.
During my spare time I would go swimming but if I was too tired for that I would settle down to a nice spot of woodwork, if this was too strenuous I would watch television or read a paper. I hope I will still be interested in collecting and reading american comics, and collecting records. 
In my home I will have at least two pets, for I am very fond of animals as it is and hope to grow more fond of them as I grow older and I will probably join a society against cruelty to animals the R.S.P.C.A.
I will also take night classes in subjects that help to run a house.  Words: 247
