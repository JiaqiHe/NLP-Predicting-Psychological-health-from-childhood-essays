To day is a very important day for me as it is my 25th Birthday. I started out in the morning towards the bus-stop. I had to get some shoping for the party I am going to have tonight. I only live in a flat so I can't have many people, about twenty I should think. Now I am twenty five I think I shall get married and have at least one child. I work in a factory and I am very interested in the work I do but I hope I will be able to work in an office soon. I get very lonley somtimes so I surppose it would be a good idea to get married. My child would go to a christian school and he or she would bring home friends for tea like I use to do when I was a little girl. I suppose then I would be very happy.  Words: 155
