If I were 25 years old I would have a good job working in a god shop. I would work from 10 o-clock in the morning and finish at 6 o-clock at night-time.  I would try and get a car if I had a lot of money and take a lot of driving lessons, so that I could be a good driver. I would do all of my house-work. I would buy a wig if I didn't have long hair. I would have a lot of pets such as a dog a cat and a rabbit. I would have a lot of lovely dresses and go out to dances. In my house I would have a lot of lovely furniture I would keep my clothes in a wardrobe. Nearely every day I would go down to see my mother and father. On a Sunday I would stay the longest because I won't have to go to work on a Sunday. For my dinner on Sunday's I would have Sunday's dinner such as carrots, peas, cabbage, turnip, potatoes and a pudding after I had finished my dinner. In my garden I would grow a lot of vegetables and flowers. I would spend a lot of money at the shops to buy a lot of grub. I would have a nice house and try and keep it clean while I was at work. I would try and have a lot of friends.  Words: 240
