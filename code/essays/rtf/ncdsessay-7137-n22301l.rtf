I have now finishe skool and have a job of a foreign language teacher. I work about 3 or 4 hours a day. In my spare time I go out with my friends and allmos every day with my sister which is 4 years yunger than me.
After a few years I intend finding another job. I like teaching foreign languages to children for it is a interesting job.
I own a small flat wich I try to keep as tidy and as smart as possible 
I lead a good life and do not ask myc for it.
I often visit my perents, which I love I shere my flat and allmost every thing I own with my sister which is in College. 
In summer I often go and visit my relations and they visit me.  Words: 133
