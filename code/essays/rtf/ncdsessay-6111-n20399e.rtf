I live in the country in a large bunglow about 9 miles from the nearest town. At the moment I am extremely intrested in building models out of wood. I have a Jaguar type car and work for a garage company. I have no wife and no intentions of getting married. I rarely cook anything but eat cold things or usually go to a cafe nearby about 1 p.m. I like sport and watch it as I have Saturday off and go to work on Wednesday When the car breaks down I usually do it myself but sometimes call my workmates when I get into difficulties I like going to the local cinema whenever I can get but always try to be there when all the good films are shouwing I am farely wealthy and earn up to xxxx50 each week. I dont buy very much food but always have a light meal about 6pm and have supper at 10.30 p m at night I go to bed at 11 pm but sometimes I'm on the late shift filling in papers and that sort of thing and dont get home till 2a, in the morning. Work starts at 9 am and finishes at about 5.30 pm in the evening I get up 7.30 and drive down to work and get there at 10 to 9.  Words: 225
