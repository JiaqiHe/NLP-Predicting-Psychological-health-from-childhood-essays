I am a geologist and I work for the government. My name is (name). My working hours are from 9am to 5pm, and I have 1/2 an hour for lunch. This job is very interesting because I studdy the structure of the earth. I always bring a specimen of earth if I have not got it. When i get home from work I try and find out what soil it is. If it is not too dark after the latter I have a game of cricket with the family, summer time of course. In the winter after work i play cra* football, and when it is dark I collect stamps. I live at the model villag* of (place), in a five bedroom house. In the time of Queen Elizebeth 1st the village was by the (place). There is only one house left there now. I have a wife and two children, both boys. On Sundays I take the family out. I have taken them to (town) near (town). Last year I took the wife and boys on a holiday to France. We all liked that very much. I am paid xxxx21 a week. I think this is resnable. One day I hope to be a professor I will be paid well then.  Words: 212
