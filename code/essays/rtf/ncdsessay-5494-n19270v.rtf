My mother has already got up and she is cooking my breakfast. I have to be at work for 8.30 pm. My works is not far from were I live. It is only just a long the street. My birthday is next month and the money I have I am going to have a new car. I think I will have a Zephur, I will be able to buy a car from my works, and might get it a little bit cheaper. My favourite colour is red, so I will have a red one. As soon as get to work I have got to check a car engine. This is a pretty easy job. It will only take about an hour. I will also have to give it a good oiling. I have got a lot of work to do this morning. After I have got to spray a car down. Then at 5' o'clock I go home  Words: 226
