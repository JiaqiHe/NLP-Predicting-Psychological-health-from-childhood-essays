I like staying at home and hardly ever go out at night. I help my mother in many ways. I dont like wearing mini skirts. I maybe go out night sometimes. I dont like pop music very much. My hobies are drawing, painting, and reading. I like washing and drying dishes and doing house-work I somtimes help my mother to paper the rooms. I am going to be a school teacher when I grow up, and I hope to visit many foreign countries.  Words: 83
