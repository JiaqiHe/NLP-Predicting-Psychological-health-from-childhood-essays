----------------------
The life I am leading is a very comfortable and pleasant life. The job pays me good wages and sometimes I do not know what to do with my money. But I usually find something to do with it. 
     I have very few intrests, and don't hardly do the things I want to do. I usually find I have work to do. (From my firm)
My home life is sometimes dreary but my handy-man kit livens me up a bit. I find my wife wants a cupboard there, up it goes. She wants a shelf here, up it goes. I work as a draughtsman at **** at ****. The wages is xxxx17-20 a month which isn't bad really. I have a car I can travel to work in which is 10 miles from ****. 
     My two children are very lively (they are twins) and like going on trips in the car to **** or ****. 
     The car is a Vauxhall Executive which has a maximum speed of 110 m.p.h. It goes 25 miles to the gallon and is back-wheel-driven.  Words: 181
