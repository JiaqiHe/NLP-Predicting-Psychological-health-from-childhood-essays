I am a worker on a farm. It is of great size. I live in a small cottage in the country. I have a very large garden and like watchinig the birds in it. I am the byre man at the farm and it is my job to look after the cows and feed them. I start at seven in the morning and stop at five at night. I walk to the farm every morning and walk home every night. I like reading newspapers and magazines and books. I like making planes boats etc out of wood and small odds and ends. Sometimes I have to go to the farm earlier if a cow is going to calfe I often have to get to the town near by for food and tools. I have two large sheep dogs who I use at the farm to herd the sheep and beasts. I never seem to be ill and I am never off my work. I have a small van* which I use to take me to the town. My house is small and has only three rooms the bedroom the living room and the kitchen. I cook my own meals and clean the house my self. I have a very big tom cat and also some budgerygars. Often I find injured birds and I take them to my house.  Words: 228
