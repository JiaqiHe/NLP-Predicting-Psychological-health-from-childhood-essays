I am 25 years old, I am Married and have 2 children and theire names are [female name] and [male name] [female name] is five and [male name] is seven. I live with my husband and children in a cosy little cottage. [female name] has Just started school and [male name] has been going too. I go to work as a full time Nurse, sometimes I am needed in Emergencies. As my Husband well he's a grower and tends to work in the green house all the time all the time. On Saturday's and Sundays I go to work so my husband looks after the children. Sometimes my Mum comes down and take the children out after school. nearly every Saturday my mum buy's the children something from town, if it's not a book it's a box of paints and if it's not that I dont know what. I dread for Saturdays when my mum comes home she never stops talking and she thinks the world of the children, you ought to see the toys the children have in their bedroom honestly the toy's they have got I can name you some Books, crayons, Paints, Jig-saws the lot, of course you can guess who brought them yes I thought you would it was there gran, she spoils them too much, My husband gets annoyed when he trips over one of [male name]s marbles and kicks one of [female name]'s dolls, and I think oh' no another emergency, here I come carrying plaster's, bandage's, cotton wool the lot.
