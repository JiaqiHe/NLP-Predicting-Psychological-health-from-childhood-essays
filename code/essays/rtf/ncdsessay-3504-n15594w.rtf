My birthday is tomorrow and I will be twenty five years old. At the moment I repair televisions but later I hope to own a small pub. Four years ago I got married and we hope to buy a new* house just outside [city]. In my spare time I like to go swiming and sometimes I go for a walk with the dog. I used to collect stamps and I still do. I have a stamp album and a small box where I keep my rarest stamps. I live in a house near [city] and it is very busy there. We hope to go to Spain for our holiday and we are sorry that we have to leave our dog at home for two long weeks. We have friendly poeple living at both sides of the house and they said that they would watch over our dog Brandy. When we come back from Spain we are going to Scotland to visit some friends I like travellling and I like especially going to the Isle of White because there is so much to see* and do, you can also learn a lot. I like being grown up because I can do things now that I could not do before when I was young. I haive many friends and we all like having fun so every month one of us holds a party and nobody is ever absent.  Words: 236
