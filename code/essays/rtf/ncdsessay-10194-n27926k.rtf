I am 25 years old and I am writing about my life. When I get older I would like to work with animals or be a nurse. But I have one intrest wich I would really like to do and that is breed horses. Horses are my favarite animal and I like them very much. To be a horse breeder you have to have a great deal of patence. When I buy a house I would live in it all the time but I would have a challet as well for weekends. My mum always says that I would make a good nurse but I dont think I would. If I went to to a place about horse breeding and I got the job I would breed Sheltand ponys and the palomino. I think most children who like horses would like to do this. I would live at Summerset because when we went on holiday to Cormwall we went through Sumerset and I liked it very, much. I would have about three fields each about an acore and start off with about 2 horses and get more and more. Now I am only 25 years old I will read books and learn about horses till I could start breeding, them. At the moment I have got two horses and there names are flash, and dinky. Flash is brown in colour and very frisky but dinky is not brown he is grey in colour. They both eat alot and they like oats and, sugar lumps wich are favarits. There field is about 1 1/2 acores and it has plenty of grass. In the corner of the field there is a water troff for them to drink out of.  Words: 287
