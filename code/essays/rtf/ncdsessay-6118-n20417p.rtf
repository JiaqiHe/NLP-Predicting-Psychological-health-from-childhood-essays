I am a pilot in the R.A.F. I am a luetenant. My friends and I are on leave, I am glad of a rest, from being cramped in a cockpit. I am going home to my mother. 
     When I got home I told her what I had been doing,  piloting goods in and around Germany where the uprisings are very bad. Really the good bombs and guns and other things. 
     Our forces out there are really in a bad way. I suppose it'll be another Dunkirk except we have to b*ing them out. But now in my lime off I set to work making another model for my collection. After a while I went to a pub and had a drink. Later I came back had a meal and went to bed. 
     Later I woke and found the time was nearly 11 o'clock. It all comes after sleeping so many nights in you plane. I dressed got some breakfast and went for a walk. 
     After an hour I returned and found my father had returned (from wherever he had been). He said hello. I had kind of ran away from them because  they wouldn't let me join. he said youv'e been called up again. Well thats the life. Okay by and back to the planes*.
