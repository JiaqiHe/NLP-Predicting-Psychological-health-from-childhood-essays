At the age of 25 I shall find a job like a footballer and settle down with it. I am interested in looking after animals. I shall go back to [city] for an interview. I would like to play for [football club] because it is a [city] team. I shall buy a hamster and look after it. I might buy a guinea pig as well. My football strip would be an all blue top blue shorts and white socks and a pair of Gola football boots. I would like to be a goalkeeper for [football club] and wear a pair of gloves.  Words: 102
