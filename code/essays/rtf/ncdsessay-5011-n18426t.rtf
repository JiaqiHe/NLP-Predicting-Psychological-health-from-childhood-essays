When Im 25 I might be a nurse you need to learn a lot of interesting things when you are a nurse. My life will be helping patient to get better to go home again. The interesting part about it is when the patient is very ill and has to stay in hospital for quite a while. Ill enjoy looking after newly born babies. Not only that children at 3 or 4 years. At home I would make dinners and read papers or books. I would have to was dishes and may be clothes. I will be doing house work and cleaning the floors.  Words: 104
