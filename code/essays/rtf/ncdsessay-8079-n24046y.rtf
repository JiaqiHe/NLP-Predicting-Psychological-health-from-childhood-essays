I would like to have a dog a shaggy one. I'd would have a piono* for playing when I got boared that is if I had finished the house work I would have electrick heating the house. I am getting up at 7 oclock and going to bed a 10:30 the children would go to bed at 8.0 clock I would mostly watch television and on fridays go out I do not go to work my husband does. I swim and play tennis when I get spare time the house work would be done by ten oclock on wednesdays and then do the washing I would have a great big garden with an apple cooker tree and two eating apple trees I would have rose bushes tulips and davadils with a lawn and a swing for the children.
