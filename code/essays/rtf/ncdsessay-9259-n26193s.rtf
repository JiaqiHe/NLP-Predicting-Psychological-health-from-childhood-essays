I hope I will be a vet when I am 25 because I like animals and my gran owns a farm. In the evenings I expect I would do a lot of knitting and dressmaking. On Saturday's in the winter I would go and support the local football team. In the summer the local cricket team. If I had not taken my coockery exam in spare evenings I may take one at the technical* college. If I could not become a vet I might study to become a teacher. I would like to teach the juniors because I think this was the best class in my school. My mum thinks I would like a job as a General practishinor because she says I like meeting people.
