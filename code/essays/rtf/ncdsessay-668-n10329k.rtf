When I am 25 years old, I hope I will be married. I will either have become a nurse, or an infant teacher. I hope to have a boy and a girl, because I don't want a very big house. When I am at home I shall be mainly doing housework and helping the children with thier homework. I will call my children [male name] and [female name]. I would like to live in the town, and have a car. I would rather have a house than a bungalow.  Words: 89
