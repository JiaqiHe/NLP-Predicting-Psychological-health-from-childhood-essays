I am now a vet and spend nearly all my time looking after animals. I have a dog of my own and am very fond of him. I still ride as I always have done, but this time I ride my own horse to my patients* houses. So far in my career I have not had any failiers and no complaints.
Last week a lady whose dog had fallen down a quarry came to me and thanked me for my good work. All I had done was to rub on some ointment and put on a splint.
The vets life is busy, interesting, well paid and tiring. but all the same I enjoy it as much as I enjoyed my next to last school. I use my school knowledge to help my vetenary surgeon work. 
Every Saturday I go to village green and play cricket with my pals. Last week I got three wickets in my first three balls which just goes to show. Next week I intend to get four wickets. At this very moment I am treating Miss [surname]'s goldfish who are all lying on the bottom of their tank. She says that she has not only filled the tank right up to the tank but she also does it all in one go which is wrong alltogether she should only fill the tank two thirds and it should be done slowly. She should use proper gold fish food instead of her parrot food.  Words: 244
