Oh well here I go, it's my first night, and my first big part on the [city] stage. My mums out there looking at me I expect. My first line - that went well.....Now the shows over. It went magnificently. I walked round to the front of the theatre with my mum, who had come backstage after the show, and looked at the pictures of (among other people) me We walked home in silence I thought I would be happy, But I was not. I was depressed. It went all right but....The show was good! Was I good anough for it.
      A few days later I was ofered a contract with [film company] Should I take it. I would get a lot of money if I did, but I loved the theater so much. I did not take it.
      I was then cast in a play (costarring) which brought me my fame, happines and sucess.  Words: 155
