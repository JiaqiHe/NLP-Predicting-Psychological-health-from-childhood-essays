I like to go and visit old people's home's and take food to them in my car. I would do all the cleaning in the house and do the washing and the shopping. I would buy a dog and the dog I would pick would be an Alstatison. The job that I was at was a nurse but I changed to be a secutary. After about ten months I would see how much I had saved up and if I had enough I would go away I might take my dog with me but I don't know yet. I have a friend who's gone to live in Australia so I might go to Australia. I would go out every Saturday with one of my freinds or I might go and play bingo with one of my freinds.  Words: 137
