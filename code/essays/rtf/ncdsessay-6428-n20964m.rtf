I am now 25 years old. I have just come out of University after studying to be a doctor. I'm a doctor at a little village in Cornwall. I breed dogs mainly collies and alsatians. There is a river near by where I swim, just about every day I usaly have survey accidents to deal with. Such as a foot caught in a harvester. In my spair time I swim in the river. For holidays I go to Scotland and places like that, camping. Other times I go touring in a boat, like up to Wales or down to the South of France. But my ambition would be to be a doctor in Canada, the place Toronto. The towns in Canada are so clean and new, and Toroto has lovely parks and skyscrapers. I once saw a film of Canada and Toronto and I thought it was an extroudinary place.  Words: 150
