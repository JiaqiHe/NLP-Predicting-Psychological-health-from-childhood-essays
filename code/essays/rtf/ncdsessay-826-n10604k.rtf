I am married I have got a job as an art teacher at a school. I go there Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays. Or Teusdays and Thursdays I do the housework. In the evenings when my husband comes home we watch television or work. My husbands job is a docter and our house has a surgary built on. Often he has to to work late into the night and he never gets much spare time. We will soon be going on our holidays at Whitsun but we will only have four days. We shall go to the contry near Wales. At school I teach art to each class above class 5. In summer they learn outside in the school grounds on easels. Every year we have an exibition of all the things the children have done. There the children display all the things that are of special interest to the teachers. Then the parents come back and look, at the drawings, needle-work and craft things. In the holidays I help my husband in the surgary and I sell some of my paintings. Usually in the summer holidays we have a week off in Wales with my husbands parents who are Welsh. We live a little flat in Croyden, Surrey. I like working as a teacher at my school.  Words: 217
