----------------------
I am now 25 years old, and I have been married three years. I have two children one aged one and the other nearly two. I work at a Vetinary surgeon about a hundred yards down the road which is veyr convenient I am interested in swimming, horse riding and physical training.
My husband works in a post office, and so I have to bring the children with me to the surgery. We have a small cottage, but is still quite roomy. Our garden is small, but there is a field at the end of it, with horses, and stables, I have a happy life with many friends, and I wouldn't like to move 
My mother lives with my sister, but quite frequently she comes to stay with us. Quite recently, we have had a new sink put on our kitchen, the old one was getting too rusty. My husband and I share a car it is a Sports car.
We go on holiday every year if possible, sometimes abroad, but usually just to the sea-side or rent a caravan.
We have a dog a Cocker Spaniel, called George, he is four now, and is a soppy old thing.  Words: 196
