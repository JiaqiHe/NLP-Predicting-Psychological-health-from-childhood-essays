I am leading a very interesting life, and I am a Nurse in a London Hospital. I live just round the corner in a very nice flat, it is on the third floor. the flat has four rooms a kitchen, a dinning room, and two bed-room. I am marrid to a doctor and have a lovely baby girl witch we have called Susan she has one tooth and is tething. I work at the hospital at night and get they ar 8 o clock and work till 7 in the morring, before I was marrid I worked in the day time quiet a lot, at night there is not a lot to do accpet giving the painet his or her medince or tablets and keeping and eye on them. When I get home at 7 oclock I get my husbands breakfast because he has to be at work for 8 30, after he has gone I get the baby up and dress, and then do the washing up witch I hate doing but it must be done. After that I change and put some make  Words: 185
