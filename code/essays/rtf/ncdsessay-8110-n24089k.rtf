"My name is (name). I teach English and Artihmetic in a Secandry Modern school. in London. I enjoy my work very much. I teach a second form class. There is only one child that is a problem and that is (name) he will insist on eating in the classroom and pinches girls while they are working he has had the strap twice for fighting with other boys younger than himself the second time was for bullying girls.
I share a flat with (name) who works at the school as well. She is a widow so she does not live with her husband.
My hobbies are swimming I have to go to a swimming baths for this though. I can do the ""Crawl"", ""Back Stroke"" and ""Breast stroke"". My other interest is needlework. I make most of my own curtains and dresses though I do not make many dresses. I have a boy-friend called (name). He takes me to films and out to dinner. I go home to my family in the holidays. I do not have much spare time at the weekend so I can not go home then.
I get on very well with the other teachers at the school. Most of them take high classes than I do. I get on fairly well with the children. They are a lot of tell-tale-tits though sometimes, espeically the girls. This is what I hope to be doing in 1983 though I may have changed my mind by then."  Words: 245
