If I was twenty five years old I might be married or I might have a job.
If I have a job I am going to try to be a secetary or a nurse. If I have children and I am goin to have a boy I would call him after my husband. Or If I have a girl I am going to call her [female name] or [female name]. If I get married and have a honeymoon I might be going Switzerland where we can go skiing and have a nice little chalet. My hobby is going to be collecting stamps and visiting places where I can get forgien ones. I am trying to get a cottage where there is a small garden. My other hobby will be swimming and entering things like coocking competitions and crosswords.  Words: 137
