When I am 25 I want to be a air hostess and fly to many places and meet lots of people. And when I stop being a air hostess I would be a shop assitent and work in a big shop like [shop] and [shop]. First I would like to assist on a counter selling cloth and sewing needles and tape measures. If the maneger asked me if I would like a change I would go to the jewelry desk and searve posh ladies who would buy diamonds and pearls. In the evenings when I had finished work I would go home and have some tea and then tidy up and wash the dishes, thats if I didn't have a robot. If I had a robot things would be different. I could just imagne a long line of robots going down to the shops with aprons on and carring a big basket. I would make it do the housework why I was at work and clean the dishes. I would let it have sunday of and thursday afternoon because I wouldn't be at work then. On thursdays a would wash my hair and put it in rollers so that I could go out with my friends on friday night. On sunday I would envite all my friends to tea. Sometimes I would go to the pictures on thursday afternoon and go to a cafe for my tea. When I had some free time I would make me some dresses and curtains  Words: 251
