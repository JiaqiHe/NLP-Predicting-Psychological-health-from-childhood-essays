I am a hairdresser. I like it very much. I work for a lady called [name] that is the name of the hairdressers shop. It would be very much nicer if I had my own shop but I can't afford to buy one I am not Married and live alone in a flat it is a very nice flat but the rent is dear. I have lots of furniture and hardly any place to put it. and I dont want to sell it because I like and want to keep it just incase I get married. I am already engaged to a boy called [name] but I dont want to marry him. I am intrested in a lot of things but hardly ever do them I am nearly always Cooking and tidying the flat. The only thing I have knitted is a jumper and that is something I like doing very much. I never sew and I used to like that I read in bed every night and that is nearly all I ever do but read. I am a very busy person because I am at work at 6 o clock in the morning till* six o clock at night then I have to tidy the flat when I get in and the only time left I have is when I am in bed. and I just get to bed and then I have to get up and I am very tired. My Work is very hard I do about 26 people a day. some want there hair, cut some want there hair permed, and some want it waved. and my feet are never of the* ground I have 2 blisters on my feet and I have to go to the haspital next week to get them off it will be the the third time I have been to the haspital.
