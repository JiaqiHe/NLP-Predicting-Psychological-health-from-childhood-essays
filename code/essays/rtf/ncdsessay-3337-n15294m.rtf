My name is (name) I am 25 years old and have one child called (name). My husband, (name) and I have a pony stud and dog kennels and we breed Highland ponies and Rough Collies. we have a bungalow and stables buildings and kennels, and we employ four people, two stable girls and two kennel maids. We have 24 mares two stallions and eleven fo*ls. In the kennels we have five bitches and five dogs with about 1 dozen pups. We are quite well off, for (name) and I go to show jumping competitions every week. We have a Cortina estate car and horse float and the sale of pups and foals helps to keep them on the road. I get hired sometimes from people who want me to ride their horse in a show jumping compeit**** and I get about xxxx20 for that. (name) who is five has her own shetland pony whom she rides and is showing great promise as a rider. Last week we sold our black stallion for xxxx1,000 pounds too a lady who was starting a stud. In the house we have a television a fridge, washing machine and gas Cooker. Next week a man from (place) is going to bring his mare down to breed with my chesnut stallion that will bring in anotherxxxx40 or so. Everything may sound expensive but it isn`t 'cause the horses stay out all except the stallions and the dogs don`t cost so very much.  Words: 246
