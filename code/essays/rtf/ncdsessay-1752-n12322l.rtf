I would like to be a fisherman on a trawler. I would do a lot of garderning. if I get a house of my own I would like a very big garden and plant vedgtables but not flowers, I would rather plant vedgtables because I can dig more and I like digging. I like faimily of my own. If I bought a house I would like it in the country. When I am 25 I would like a car and the make I would try to get would be a Zepher after I had my tea I would watch telvsion for a hour and then I would go out and do a lot of gardening and I would water my vedgtables and I would plant fruit trees like apples goseberrys and pears. In the morning I would try to get to work as early as I can and I could go in my car. I would try to make a lot of friends a work. On the weekend I would take my faimly out in the car. If some thing was wrong is the house I would try to sort It out.  Words: 192
