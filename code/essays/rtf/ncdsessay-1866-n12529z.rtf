I am in the R.A.F. and the life I am leading is interesting well planned and enjoyabe.
My mane interest is still sailing and I am in the squodrons sailing team. I am flying F**ntoms at the moment and the fantom is a nice plane to handle. I am not yet married but I am engaged. The food that we get is very good .
I think the life that I am leading is great and i would seriously advise joining the R.A.F. . Many people think that you're just slapped into a uniform and told to get on with it, but it's not like that atall you're treated fairly and squarely.
In you're spare time there are many activitys join. such as , Karting, Canooing, Climb-ing, Swiming and sailing.
During the year you get a substantial amount of leave . There are many different branches of the R.A.F. there's the flying side, the elic-tronic side and the mecanical side as well as many others.
It isn't easy to be board in the R.A.F. because there's always something to do.  Words: 175
