In the morning I get up at half past six get my breakfast. Finish breakfast brush my hair go upstairs and make the bed. I go out to work. Have a break a 11 o clock and go back to work. At 1 o clock go home for dinner. I stay home for an hour then go back to work for an hour. When I come home I have to do housework like ironing or washing. When I've done that it is about 4.O.Clock. So I usually start getting the tea. After tea I do some sewing. When I've finished the sewing I go out to see a friend of mine. When I come back it is about 8 o clock and I turn on T.V. and watch for a few hours. The programmes are usually very interesting. SOme days there is a film in. At last I go to bed  Words: 151
