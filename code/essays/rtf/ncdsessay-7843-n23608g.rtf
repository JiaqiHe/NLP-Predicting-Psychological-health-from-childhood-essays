I am now a teacher in the infant department., I lead an interesting life. i go riding about once a fortnight , and go out with my friends to the ice skating or dance-ng . quite a lot . I share a flat with my friend , who is also a infant teacher , but not in the same school . I like design-ing my own clothes . My flatmate and I often go out together . I enjoy my work . I trig to help them to be construct-ive , and to think of things for themselves.
O ur flat is neat and tidy as well. We do some house-work before we set off for work , so we have to be up quite early in the morning. On Saturdays , Sundays or holidays we my friends and I , like to pack a picnic lunch and go to the seaside. 
I like to arrange outings for my class that they will enjoy , and I try to be understanding.
I enjoy my life and and my work and I am satisfied with what I have achieved .  Words: 187
