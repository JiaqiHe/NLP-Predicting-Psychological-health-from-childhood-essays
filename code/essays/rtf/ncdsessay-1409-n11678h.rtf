"I am 25 years old and * have got a job at [company], and I am a tool setter. Some* of the men and people call block ""C"" Land of the giants, because of the presses. The presses are 25 to 30 feet high, and the tools are 10 feet long and at least I to 2 tons heavy. We have to have cranes to lift up the tools because of there weight. There is a [company] pub on the premisses, and I go in there to have a drink, and to play snooker and darts. There is a ball room and they sometimes have conserts and dancing. The presses have air presure and there is an ar*n like on one side, which pulls out the side of the can* that is being made. There is a canteen where you can buy milk and sugar and a nice dinner, and a pudding or soup for after's. Every year a police man comes and learns the children about road safty, and every year they have a christmas party for the children."  Words: 180
