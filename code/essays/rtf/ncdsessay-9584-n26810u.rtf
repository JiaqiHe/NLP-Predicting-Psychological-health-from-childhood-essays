I am 25 years of age and working as a chif on a liner. I live in a big house with a large garden. I am still a keen stamp collector and being on a liner I can get stamps from every port we dock at. When I get leave from work I like to go for long walks on Exmoor, dartmoor or the side roads. My last trip was to Singaport and I had to work 8 hrs a day, when I get time off on board ship I play darts or go swimming. I usarly cook from 6am to 10am and from 6pm to 10pm. Our liner carries about 400 passengers and 200 crew. In the galley work 50 men teenagers who wash-up, I started of at 19 as a wash up boy and worked up from there. Some times we have swimming galas where all teh crew take part. Our next trip is to Spain and we have a lot of spainish passengers aboard, I will have to look up on my spaininsh recipes, we are only carrying 100 passengers on this trip we have a lot more crew to take over to their ship which was damaged on a rock of the spaininsh cost-line. When we dock at Spain I have to change ships for the present ship I am on is being refited at Spain. My next ship is going to a large island the the Paciffic. When I get to this island I am going to fly home free of charge and wait for the ship which is in Spain to come back to England then I am of again, to where I don't know, when I don't know either.
