I would like to be a diesel driven driving up and down the line. I would like to travel from **** to London and from London to Birmingham expressing people. Sometimes I would express good from station to station dilivering good picking them up and going to oter* stations. Ther is a lot of kinds of trains like big D, Jubilee, tanker railcar, Deltic, Brush, D 400, and shunters. Shunters are very strong trams. And another very fast train is a sulzer. Diesel drivers bring goods to the shed. I drive a diesel engine fetching goods in to the shed and a shunter takes them into the station and unloading them. After we have unloaded the goods we use British rail waggons to take them to the docks and loaded on ships. Most of the British rail waggons of three wheals* one at the front and two at the back. Sometimes when I am not doing anything I drive a British rail waggon to tthe docks I drive a three wheeled waggon I sometimes carry drums of parrafin and children some times goes with me. All the petrol goes on a tanker bannanas go on bannana boats cranes unload the bannas and unloads them cranes are very useful on the docks.  Words: 211
