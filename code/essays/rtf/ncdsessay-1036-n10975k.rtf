I have a medium sized farm house with 70 acres of fields of which 30 acres are corn fields and the rest is used for grass growing to feed the cows. There are 60 head of cattle including two bulls. On a morning when I are * tending to the cows my wife looks after the 500 hens which we keep for eggs and sometimes we sell some. Sometimes I got to marts and buy of or sell cattle. Or sometimes I may take some cattle which I think are very good to a cattle show. I get up every morning at 6o clock to feed the cattle. There are often calves born some of these I fatten up to sell for beef and others I keep* for milk. We have atomatic milking machines but some cows I milk by hand. The cows give a gallon to a gallon and a half a day. In the winter the cows have to be kept in but in the summer they can be let out to graze in the fields.  Words: 178
