I like playing with baby children to the age of three when I grow up I should like to have some Children of my ouen. I do not think I shall go to work when I am older unless I have to. I should like to get married at the age of about 22 if I do get married at all. I should also like to keep on living in [town] or fairly near so that I will be near my parents. If I do have to go to work at all I think I might be a secratery like the girls at my dads work they are all very nice. If I get married I shall get married to a respectible man who does not drink alot and who also likes children like myself. I am interested in languages. My sister [name] learns french and Latin and she teaches me french at night sometimes. I might even be a teacher and go to college but I am not really very Interested in doing this. I like the life I lead and I always try to be happy and be good. I like very much reading books by the authors Enid Blyton and Kathleen fidler  Words: 205
