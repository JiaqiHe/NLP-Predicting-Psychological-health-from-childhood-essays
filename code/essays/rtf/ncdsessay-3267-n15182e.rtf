I have just taken a job as a football player. We play every Saturday and we train four days a week. I live in a council house. I am married and have two children 1 boy 1 girl. I am now interested in cars, ships, and nature. On days off sometimes* I go into the country with my children and we watch the animals and their young. I also have a partime garage, my own car is a ford. On holiday we usually go to Spain or Ireland. Sometimes in spare time I read books but most of the time I go out with my wife for the dancing. In my job as a footballer I earn xxxx200 a month.  Words: 120
