I will be a driver of the city of Leicester buses or a Advance Todemaster* or I will work on the B.R.S.
If I am one of them I will be a long distant driver like my dad he works on the advance towlemaster as a long distant driver it is on **** road at **** for about four year. The I will go in a Engeingeing place like the B.U. as a miller. 
My brother used to work at the B.U. near **** baths. 
My dad has been on the *ans for about 8 year and he is 49 so the means he wars on the vans at the towlemaster place since he was 41. 
When I finesh at the B.U. the will be when I am 40 year of age and I will be a bus contuckter on the Midland Red or the City of Leicester corpions buses.  Words: 149
