I would go in the navy, to sail on ships and do very good sport. I would still be with mum and dad and not get married. I would be out on ships sailing, in the navy, and go to different countrys like Spain, Austallia, Japan and go actoss the English Channel. I would be earning about eight pounds a month, for start off and in my spear time when I have a holiday I would help mum and dad. I would chop up fire wood, cut the back and front lawn and plant garden seeds. I would stay in the navy for a long time and do very good experiences. When my mum and dad dies if I am old enough still, I might get married then and have a few children. I might have two, three or four children. I would teach my children how to add up beofre they go to school. I would also teach them how to do all sorts of things so that they will have good reports.  Words: 174
