As I left my house I thought I would be late for I had got up late as usual but I was just in time for the bus. When I arrived at the office I sat down in a large chair and got on with my papper work. Then when the summer hollidays had come so I looked to go to the south of France. In the south of France I would stay in a hotel. When I had came back I would get on with more work. Then if I had eny sper work I would decorate the house. if i had eny more time I would visit my mother and the rest of my famaly. then when I were getting old I a retier and live a peacful life and get a good baby.
