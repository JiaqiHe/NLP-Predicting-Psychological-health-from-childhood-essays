I am now twenty five and have a good job at a hairdressers. I have a family of my own which is made up of four people. My Children's name's are [male name] and [female name] who are now in thier first year at school Every morning at half past eight I see my children on the bus and then walk down to the hairdressers to get a good start. [male name] and [female name] don't come home for dinner so I have mine in peace with my husband. [male name] my husband works in a factory 2 miles out of town. I go out every Saturday night because thats the only time my Mother can baby-sit. 
My friends go out to the swimming baths with me every Wedneday they all also play tennis with me. I am very fond of sport and spend most of my spare time doing it. My Children go to the same Catholic school I did. My brother-in-law lives in London with his wife and three children. 
I enjoy my pretend life and hope you enjoy reading it.  Words: 183
