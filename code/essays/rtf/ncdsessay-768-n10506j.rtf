I am now 25 and I live in a small house with my Husband. And I clean the house when he had gone to work. He works at an office he is a clerk. I do not work yet but I will when I am older. My hobbies are tennis, swimmigg and reading. My husband and I go out to the country ever now and then to hear the birds singng and look at the nice green trees and we are sometimes lying on the grass looking at the blue sky with the white clouds drifting across the sky. I sometimes go and see my mother and we sometimes go and my husband's mother. Our house has a nice small garden with a lawn. I wash the clothes on Tuesday and Iron them and put them away. Our house is near the [river]. near [town] it looks nice with the lace curtains in the windows. It is just like a cottage with the little white fence with a its garden path. The house is a bungalow. We both want children so we can get a bigger house near to our mothers.  Words: 191
