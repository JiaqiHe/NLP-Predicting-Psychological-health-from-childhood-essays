----------------------
I left the university, I had been studying in, with a degree that would help me to be a vetinery surgeon, about one year ago. I intended to start my work in the Niarobi district in Kenya which is in east Africa.
Now I am married to a woman who also knows something about being a vet. Also two of my old school friends who wanted to be vets. have come with us. We have now a small bungulow like building with only two rooms in it. One for our opperating theatre and rather a smaller one for our, like a small zoo in which we keep the small animals which we have opperated on and their wounds are healing.
For my two assisting doctors, my wife and I we live in an averaged sized cottage next door. At the front of the two buildings are larger cages for the bigger animals. We have one tame animal for a pet. He is a young tiger cub called Tigger.
For our transport we have a mini-make* which is a kind of small jeep. Really it is not enough we could very well do with two viechles but for only almost a year's habitation in this country I thinck we are getting on very well.  Words: 210
