"I am a normal housewife and I have one child. I will now begin my story. ""[male name] will sleep or should sleep for a couple of hours but if he wakes up before I get back there is a tin of Heinz beans in the cupboard."" I was going out to do some shopping and my husband is looking after my young son. ""Bye,"" I shouted and walked out the back door. The town was a couple of miles away and so I had to catch a bus.
In town I first of all went to the big supermarket. ""I had better get a big trolley for I know I will get a lot of groceries,"" I thought to myself. After finishing my shopping at the supermarket I went to Woolworth's. Looking at my shopping list I saw I had many things to get. I soon had tham all and caught a bus.
My life I think is very full with never a spare moment. My hobby is looking after young children and babies. Our home is not our own. My husband is working in the R.A.F. and so it is to be truthful theirs. It is a bungalow with two bedrooms, a bathroom, a dining room, a living room, a kitchen and a long hall with a glass door. It is a lovely house and I enjoy being twenty-five very much."  Words: 231
