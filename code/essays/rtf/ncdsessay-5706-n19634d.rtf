I am now working as an electricion. I cycle to work and take a pack lunch. When I go home I mend a fuse or two and watch the newz have my supper and do some work and then go to bed. Then it all starts again I get up at 8 oclock and eat my breakfast then cycle to work. on Saturdays I would lay in and get up at perhaps 11 oclock have a cup of tea and tidy up then after lunch take the dog for a walk and watch the news. After supper I would go out somewhere then go to bed. On Sundays I would get up go to church and keep the scouts in order come back have lunch on the beach if fine after lunch. Go for a walk then watch the news and have supper then go to bed so I can get up in the morning to start work all over again.  Words: 161
