I would like to have a flat and get married and go to partys and bye my husband clothes and my kid and my self and have no trouble and have a big dog I will call it Glen. and visit my freinds and go to visit my mum and dad and brothers and sisters and see my little pup flash and take it home with me to company my little dog alen I would keep it clean and take care of it that it does not go into dustbins or run after traffic or chase cats. I would go out with my kids and husband on sundays and get a baby sitter to come on Fridays and saturdays and I would give them something for it and go my hollidays every year to rossy or any where will do as long as I go somewhere even salcoats will do.
I would miss my freinds and my mum and dad but if I missed him that much I could go to see him every day and night after my dinner and give my husband his dinner and take him with me after we are in the house a year we will flit to an other house a plain house With a front Garden and a back door and a front door and stay there for a long long time.
