It was my second year at this school as a teacher I take the infants who are hard to cope with there goes the bell now its time to go home for the day. I am glad to be home I still have to cook the dinner and I have not much time never mind I'll have a read at the new book I bought while I am waiting for it to get ready I think I will take a chair out to the back garden and read in the sunshine for a little while. After a quarter of an hour I got up to see if it was ready and so it was. Just then my husband came in and asked whats for supper and I said: Potatoes, mince and cabbage. After we had finished we went to the cinema. We were at the cinema nearly 3 hours and when we came home it was late. We had a cup of cocoa going to bed and then we fell asleep.  Words: 171
