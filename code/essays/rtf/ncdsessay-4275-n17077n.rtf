Im not married, but Im engaged. The house I live in his a flat it has 4 rooms which are the frontroom the kichen the bedroom and the bathroom, it is quite a big flat. it is in the country. It takes about half hour to get to it from my work. When I get home I get my tea. After I* had to go into the front room to watch television for about 3 to 4 hours and then I go to bed. On saturday I go and watch my favourite football club, and sometimes I go swimming. And thats about all my ***ly life at 25.  Words: 145
