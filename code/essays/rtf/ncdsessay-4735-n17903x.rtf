When I am 25 I will go to work and have a family. I may have one child or two children. My sport will still be ice skating. I like ice skating very much I usuly go ice skating at great yarmouth till it closed down. but now in my sper time I like to have a game of rounders or if not that I would take to my freids and may go shopping for our mother's. One Tusday I would go down the high street and get some off my shopping done but on Wednesday I would go up town and have a look round the shopps to see if I want any dress or shose in a sale what I would like to by my children or me a coat so that they could have a coat for best and one for trouses and a playing out coat. I think I would like to work at [business name] where my mother works and make caks, pies, and all sorts off nice things. I would be a afternoon worker and come out off work about 6-o-clock and my husband come and get me in the car it will be a sports car. Then I will go home and have my tea a the go to bingo to see if I can win the big money or just win.
For my holiday I would go to spain or USA for about a week or two week's I would by a spanish suit so that I could take it back to London with me. and when I was at spain I would send my freinds a post card and bring them back a present from spain.  Words: 284
