I am twentyfive years of age. I haven't got a job yet, but I'm hoping to get one soon. At the moment I'm at a collage. I live in a flat with a friend in London. I'm not married as yet, but I'm engaged to a girl of twentyfour. We are planning to get married as soon as I've left collage and got a good job with good pay. She also goes to the collage which I go to. But she doesn't know when she's going to leave and what she's going to do when she does. We are going to get married at my home town [town] and we might live there but we're not quite sure about that. My girlfriend likes going to the pictures but I'm not so keen. I still go with her though. I'd rather stay at my flat and play a few Bob Dylon records, but she always gets her own way. She lives in a flat as well, but it is'nt the same one as me. She has'nt got any family, because her younger brother and sister were killed when she was only three. And she hardly remembers them. Later her Mother and Father were devorced and niether of them wanted her. So she was put in a home. My life is just like what I've already told you, but with a few fancy details cut off.
