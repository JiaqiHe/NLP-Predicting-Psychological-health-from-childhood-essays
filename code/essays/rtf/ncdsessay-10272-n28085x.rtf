I would hope that I was married at twenty five with two children. They would be young children I would have no job, I would just be a housewife. I would have a busy life. I would go swimming often, maybe every week. My interests would be sewing, cooking, swimming and maybe other things. I would go to evening classes for sewing and cooking twice a week. I would go into town every week. I would learn to drive. I would live in a big estate with quite a large house. I would I hope I would have quite a lot of friends.  Words: 103
