I am on a train going to be a groom at a riding school The [surname]'s house is an old mock tudor house. There are quite a few famous horses in this stabe. I get up at five every morning and groom and muck out the horses, feed the dogs and horses. One of the children is going to a show today so I put a tail bandage on her horse and plait its main. About 8 o' clock I go in and get my breakfast, then I go out and exercise some of the horses till dinner, after dinner I clean some of the back. Tonight is my night of and I am going into town to the ice-rink. The meals are good. Today I am to take some beginners onto the common. We canter acros the common, as usual and then head for home. I do this and look after the horses nearly all day, but it is good fun.  Words: 162
