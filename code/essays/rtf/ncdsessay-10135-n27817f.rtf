I am now twenty five years old. I live in a caravan with my friend ****. We have another caravan in which we are vets. When we left school we studied for eight years. We live at ****, and enjoy outdoor life. We go horseriding, fishing, digging for cookies, birdwatching, and enjoy taking our six dogs and eight puppies out for walks. We spend most of our spare time on the beach sunbathing, swimming and boating. We are planing to buy a big house right on the beach with a big garden with a high fence round. and a pond, it also has three box-rooms, one bathroom, one toilet, one livingroom, one sittingroom, one kitchen, and four bedrooms.
