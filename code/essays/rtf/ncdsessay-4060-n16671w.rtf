----------------------
I am married with two children, one three, one five. My husband works shift work at the steel works. We live in a detatched house. This is quite a large house with four bedrooms. We have a very large garden for the children and there is a park across the road. I go dancing with my husband every Tuesday at 7.30 pm and leave the children with my mother. I make all my clothes and all the childrens clothes. My husband and I watch the television when the children have gone to bed. This is the only time we get any peace. Every Christmas we have quite a few guests and have a very good time on Christmas day. I always go to a New Years Eve party, which all our friends and relations go to.  Words: 136
