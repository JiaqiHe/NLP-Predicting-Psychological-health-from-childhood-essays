I go to the college on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wendnesdays and thursdays . I hope that after I go through my exams I can get a good job and make good money . While I am at home on a weekend I take the children away out and tell their nanny that she can go home for the weekend . When I go back to the college on Monday I start at once again to find out about interesting facts on the history of all the world and it's famous explorers and what they discovered. I take a lot of interests in my children and my husband . I also enjoy reading a lot of Robert Loue Stevensons books and poem books . He was a great author and is still very very famous. I leave the college in two months ,  Words: 141
