I would like to go canoing, boating and skin diving as spare time activeaties. The one I enjoye most now is canoing. When I leave school I would like to have some advace levels so I can have a well payed job. I would like to have a job dealing with computers and other things that have a tecnical backround. These I know will be quite well payed jobs in future years. I would not like a prefabrecated* flat or house. The most likely done by electric The wall will have central heating pait. I do not want a large family. This because of the price of living would have rose a lot. I would have a telephone with a picture on of the pearson you are calling. There would be at least two compautors in the house. I know the wold will be using them in every day life. For a holliday people will be going to the moon for a holliday. I would like to go. People will be living under the sea  Words: 175
