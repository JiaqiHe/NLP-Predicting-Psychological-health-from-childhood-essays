I am 25 and I am a short hand typist I have an office to myself so that when I am typing I don't make a mistake. I have lots of work to type out and when I am finished typing I give the papers that I have typed to my manager. Before I type the paper I right them in a pad I get a lot of money . I work from two to five at night. Sometimes I take my type writer home and type there. My work is only a short distance away from my house. I get the car there, and when I have my type writer I sometimes take the bus home. I have blue eyes and fair hair. On my time off I knit and read. On sunday I go out with my friends. We have our lunch in a resturant and then we go to the cinema, it start at two o'clock and finishes at five o clock On monday I got in at two o clock and come out at four o' clock. When I go home at four o' clock I stay in and knit or read.  Words: 196
