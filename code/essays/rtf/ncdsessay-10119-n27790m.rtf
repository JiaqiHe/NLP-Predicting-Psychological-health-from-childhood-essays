"At the age of 25 I have got a good job. The job is plan*ng* out sections of railway track and showing it is mold* form someday last week I got a xxxx1-10-** rise because the section. I had planned worked in actual life. the plan was this: somewhere near Exeter they were wondering if a cutting* should be dug. After 2 days of thinking I said to the boss, ""I think that the cut*ing should go in.""
     My interest are still the same mo*ld railway trains, swimming* and reading.
     At home, I have modernised everything, radio cookers, lifts instead of stairs, a video ****en in each bedroom, a computer in the study and a model railway truck in the front room. Also in the study is a typewriter. In the garage is a minuture concorde. In the store shed is a hovercraft and a submarine."  Words: 146
