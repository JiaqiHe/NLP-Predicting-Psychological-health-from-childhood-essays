I am a speedway rider I race for Sheffield Tigers every night in my spare time I do things to my bike. My other intrest is fishing, I usually enter for angling contests. I am not married and I am quite rich because I have won a lot of races. My proper job is a motor bike mechanic and I also test speedway bike enginges. I smoke but I do not drink. My left eye is always running because I once got a bit of grit in it when my goggles were broke. Sometimes after a meeting I take all my bike to bits. Speedway is very dangerous and my right leg as been broke twice. I also like to play cricket with some of my pals but not very often. I spend quite a lot of time writing letters to my friends who are in forighn countries. I am saving up for a more powerfull bike which is going to go much faster but it will cost a lot of money.
