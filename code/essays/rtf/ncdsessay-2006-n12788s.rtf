When I am 25 I would like to be* married and have two children I would like these to be one boy and one girl. I WOULD LIKE TO live at [town] and I want to live beside my mother. When both my children start school I want to start a part time job. I want to live in an ordinary 3 bedroom house with quite a big garden and I just want to be a normal person. Before I get married I would like to stay on at school and be in the rounders, netball and hockey teams I would like to be very good a sport. I want to be very good at making things IN NEEDLEWORK and before I get married I would like to work in a dress shop WHEN I AM ABOUT 28 or make cloths. At school I want to be very good at cooking so that when I am married I will be able to make some good meals for my husband and children. If I am good at needlework I will be able to make clothes for them. When they start school I will go out on Saturday nights and will work through the week. I want to have a daughter who is very modern and does not like fancy dresses and things like that. And I don't want my son to be a sissy. I want to rich enough to abroad on our holidays every year. When my daughter is old enough I would like her to be in the netball and rounders team because I am very interested in netball especally. I would like to work as a typest before I AM 21 and work in a factory after I get married.  Words: 292
