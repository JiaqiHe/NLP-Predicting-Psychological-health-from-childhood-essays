At the age of 25 I am a batchallor and I live with my mother in a flat in [town name].  My job is a builder and I have managed save quite an amount of money. At the moment I am putting the finishing touches to a semi-detached house in [street name]Street, after which my mother and I will be taking a well earned rest in Majorca for a couple of weeks. We have arranged it so that we can just celebrate my mothers birthday on [date] before we leave. We will set off on the [date] and hope to arrive home on the [date] at about dawn so that we can go straight to bed when we get home and sleep as long as we want while were away. a friend of mine [name] will look after the house for us and see that our cat [name] gets his feed. If I get back in time I would like to see about changing my job while I am able to do so. On holiday I shall think about the job that I would like to do. The jobs that as a possibility are a shift[?]. I like carting when I can do a carpenter. I go to woodwork classes. A lorry driver, I can drive or [illegible fiche] I could become a Policeman. These are all possible but I think a carpenter would suit me the best. The reason I am changing my old job is that if I get married I may not be able to save enough money for us to live properly and we may be seperated. Anyway, I'm off to work now on the last couple of days before my holiday.  Words: 286
