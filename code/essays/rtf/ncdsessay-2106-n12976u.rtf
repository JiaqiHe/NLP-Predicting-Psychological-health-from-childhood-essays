Just now I am leading a happy life being a hairdresser, I want to go to Spain for my holiday's for about a month, I am having a very happy life just now and wish it will be happy for always. My interest wehn I was about ten was to be a hairdresser and now I am one, my trade is quite good and I am happy. My home life is good as well I am not married an I stay with my mummy and daddy I do not want to get married and I never will because I dont have to stay in the house most of the time and watch children, I take my brothers' children out on my spare time. I give them threepence a day and they get money of their mummy's and daddy's my life at home is happy to I give my mother and father their breakfast in bed every morning, I go the shopping on a Saturday. I ride my horse when I come home from work, I take him out for an hour or so I *** him graze when I am out, he is a dark brown horse named (name) and he has a stable down in the farmer's park. To-day I will be going to se* my brother (name) he has three children named (name), (name), and (name) his wife is working at the (place). But I still like being a hairdresser, Their are girls making wigs just now, so I hope to be able to make wigs to I am leading a happy and pleasant life just now. I said before I do hopeit will last for ever. I work well in the house, I hoover the carpet, make the beds, do the washing and dusting etc. My interest if good to.  Words: 303
