I am a Royal Air Force cadet and I lead a happy life. I am flying for most of the time and when I am not I'm doing sports or studying. It is a great life the foods good and so are a lot of other things. My interests are mainly on the great wars and the aircraft and how they flew. Scince I visited Verdun and saw fort Doumant and went round the defences I have always wanted to go back there. My hom when on leave is a small flat near [town]. It is not much but its home and I like it. My mother is old now but I still like her. At night I sleep in the barraks. The lights are out at eight 'o' clock sharp and we are up a seven 'o' clock. The life is a good one and I wouldnt give it up.  Words: 151
