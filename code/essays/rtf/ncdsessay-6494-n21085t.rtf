Coming home from work which was a job of secutary I thought about my interests, work, home life and the life I was leading. Work was hard but good and though the hours were long and depressing. Getting home late every Friday didn't help very must. My interests were still games and stamp collecting. I still enjoyed a the odd game of hockey at the weekend but didn't play all season. My stamp collection was high at about two thousand. but I didn't seem to have many lately. Home life was good. but being late home from work meant that I had to do house work late in the evenings when I could be reading a book. The life I am leading I think is not good enough. I must work harder and try * to be at home on time every week not once or twice when there is not must mail. Also the grocery bill is gradually increacing so I must cut down Bread and potatoes. At this I arrived home.  Words: 173
