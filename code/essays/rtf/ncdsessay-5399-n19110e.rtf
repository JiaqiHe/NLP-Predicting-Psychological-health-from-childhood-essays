I am a footballer playing for Glasgow Rangers. I am a proffesional playing at inside right. Playing alongside me is [male name] [surname]playing at outside right.
My interests are football, tennis, and gold. I always have liked football. I like tennis because my dad played for a club and I took a notion for the game and started to play. 
I am married and live in a house with a garden beside it and sometimes concentrate in the garden. I have two children a boy and a girl. The boy likes football and I play with him in the garden. He also supports Rangers and goes to all the home games. The girl is not as much interested in it as the boy. The boy's name is [male name] and the girl's [female name], Saturday nights my wife and I go to a dance or cinama and my parents watch the children. In Sundays when the weather is nice we go somewhere, where the children can play. And on Monday nights visit my parents, and on Fridays visit my wives parents. When odler I would like to be a manager for a football club espiecally Rangers. If no I would like to be a pilot of an aeroplane for any service at all.  Words: 212
