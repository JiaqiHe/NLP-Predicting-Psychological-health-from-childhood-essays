I think I would like a quite cottage in the Lake district , and a very big lawn , and a small wood nearby, with a gushing stream. Also I would like to own a small public house , about a mile away . and plenty of customers coming for a drink. I would not mind having a private beach with a chally . Sometimes I would not mind visiting my parents and cousin. Some Iwould take the children to the pictures. If I had a car it would be a Aston Martin.  Words: 145
