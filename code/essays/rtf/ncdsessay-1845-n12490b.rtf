When I get a job I shall perhaps work on a lorry, In my sparetime I shall keep pidgeons. I shall get a car and I might get married and have children I would like to have two children a Boy and a Girl. I shall buy my own house. I would like to live in Devon because it is nice and sunny ther. I shalll not smoke, I shall perhaps have a holiday abroad. I shall live a comthtable live. I shall visit my mother and father very often. I want a job were I can make friends with people. I might play football for the village team Perhaps I might go for a ride with my wife and children. If I keep pidgeon I might enter for races. I shall live in a nice house in the country becase I dont like living in the town becace of the crowded streets.  Words: 153
