When I am 25 years old I will be married. I will have about 2 children of about 3 years old. They would be twins. My job would be an architect and I would go to work at about 8.30am and come back at 7.00pm. My wife would not go to work but would stay at home doing the housework and looking after the children. The house would completely belong to me and it would be situated just outside the town. I would have designed my own house.
On the Sunday and Saturday afternoon I woul either stay at home or go out with my family. I would go ou most likely on the Sunday. We would go on holiday in the summer every year and 1 or 2 times go abroad. Every week I would give my wife about xxxx10 for the expense for the children and her. She would also have a car so that she could do her shopping. For the children there would be a pet cat for them to play with.
The house would have a field next to it and it would also have a lovely garden. I would look after it on the Sunday. In one corner of the field I would have some apple trees and in the other there would be a pond. The house itself would have central heating and a telephone and television. There would be 3 bedrooms and a play room. The rest of the house would just be normal. 
If I am lucky I would earn about 40 pounds a week. If I started early on the job and I worked hard.  Words: 273
