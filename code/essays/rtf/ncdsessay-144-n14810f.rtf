I am a teacher and I am very busy. every day that comes in school hours and out of school. I have great intrest in becoming a teacher and I am one. sometimes little children are fighting and I go and stop stern and tell them that it is wrong to fight and I tell them to shake hands and go off and be friends again and so they do when school is over I go home and I have a pile of books to be marked and when I have to go to bed I put my head on my pillow and i go to sleep straight away. In the morning I get up early. have my breakfast and I go back to school. I then start marking books again. I enjoy being a teacher very much and I wouldn't do any other job but teaching I take a very good class and I have games and acting with other classes besides my own. Some-times they make me very cross and if it is a day when we have art together we only have half an hour instead of a full hour. For the next half hour we do poetry and the next day they behave themselves or they do not have what ever is coming to the [illegible] that day. I do not hit them I only cosd them or make them do 100 lines for me or more. or they miss their games or art or acting. One day I hope to become a head-mistress and then I will be more busy than I was when I was a teacher.  Words: 273
