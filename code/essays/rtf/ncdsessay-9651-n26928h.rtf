I am a woman of 25 and am very active . My job is a teacher at a primary school and I enjoy my job very much . At our farm my husband and I breed black Labroders and have five horses . Every day I get up at six o'clock to feed the animals and ride my horse. ** is a wonderful feeling glalop-ing over the meadows and through the woods early in the morning. I am a keen swimmer and am a member of a swimming club I often go skating as well and I am also a member of a skating club. I think I am lucky to have such an active life and enjoy it so much .
