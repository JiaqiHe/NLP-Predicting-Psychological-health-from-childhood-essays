I work as a bricklayer and I also draw in spare time and at the weekends . I often play football on sundays with all the other men. I usually sit and read book or newspaper. I have a younger brother who is an expert dribbler and when we go out to have a game he dribbles too much and nearly trips over the ball. after the game I take my dog a walk I walk about ten miles a day with the dog. I usually get lost but my dog finds the way home I am very interested in science and foriegn languages for example later, french, eguptian, Belgain, Dutch, and Swedish . I study *** awful lot . I have hardly any time to watch t.v. with my work, ***** *** when I'm playing football or drawing. When i do get time to wacth T. V. it is only at night after my work. I get time to go to the cinema when all I have to do is ******* when I come back i have to watch my baby brother. and that is the story of the life I am leading.  Words: 194
