The other three are getting on very well at school and they all like it very much except for one he is the second youngest who dose not like his school work nor the teachers and from what I have seen his work isant very good neighter his older Brother says that he is the nautyest in the school and I can quite belive him for he is always making toruble and if he is not making it he is looking for it. He is the terror of the family and is always making mischife and teasing the others or something like that but on the whole I like him as much as the others and I hope thta he and the others will lead a very happy life like me .
