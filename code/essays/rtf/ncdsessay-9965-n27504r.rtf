In my life I will be married and have a job, the job I want to do is to be a film star. I want to be a comedian and and go all around the world. I want two children a dog and a boat. In my private life I will go drinking about once a week. In the daytime that I have of. I will rest in the morning and In the afternoon I will go swimming or skating or bowling. I will take my children out on Sundays and go to the cinema with the children but I wont spoil them and wont be stricked with them. But sometimes I will have to hit them sometimes. When I get old I will keep as fit as I can. And I wont leave all my relatives like some people do. And when I die and if I lave anything to leave I will give it to my son and daughter if I do have a son and daughter.  Words: 169
