Now that I've been a vet for three years I have got quite a good position. I live in a maltie storie flat with my mum and dad. I work 7 hours a day from 9 . to 6 o 'clock. When I'm not working I sometimes read books or go to the picture and I watch the . T.V. quite often. I have a small red car , some-times I use it when I call at peoples houses to see if there pets are getting any better .  Words: 89
