----------------------
I am 25 years old. Compare it to 14 years ago its quite a difference. For a start I have got a job at athe gasworks as a part-time worker. My most interesting job is poetry. But a car accident changed that. Also I like doing sculpturing. I haven't got my own studio, but my friend lends my his studio. I like watching television, and listening to the radio. And as soon as I get home I go to sleep till my wife wakes me up, with the television blaring away, and also my supper on the table. I am leadng a good life with two children who are twins. One's name is [name] the other's name is [name]. One is a kind of boy who has nothing to do, the other always watches television, with his eyes glued to the set. [name] their friend is not a bad boy usually. That brings me to the end of my story
