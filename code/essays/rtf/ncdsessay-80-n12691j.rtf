I work in a factory. I have to get out of bed at six o,clock and make brreakfast for three. Then I put on my coat and catch the 7-30 bus to [xxxxxxx]. When I'm working my husband dresses Sally and take's her to play school and at 1.30 in the afternoon I come from work and fetch Sally from play school and get her dinner. My husband has his dinner then goes to work I stop at home and do the washing and jobs at home I useuilly sew and make cloths. I hern £20 a week my husband herns £25. I have been marid 4 years and Sally is two and a half years old. I go shopping on Friday morning because I have Friday off from work.  Words: 130
