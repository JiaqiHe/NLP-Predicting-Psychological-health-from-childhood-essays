I am married and might have children then I will probably only be a dog nurse I would get home about six and get the children their tea Id tidy the house and settle down to a qiuet evening. Watching television or sewing On some evenings we may go to the cinema and leave the children with a baby-sitter In the morning I set the children off to school and go to work myself. I would work in* a modern hospital and I hope to become a matron some day On sundays if it is fine we may go out or if it is wet just stay at home. We have partys and pepole in for drinks.
