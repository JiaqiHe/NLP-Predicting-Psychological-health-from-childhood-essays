"I got off the bus and walked down the country lane to our nice new bungalow. I shared it with my older sister,
The bungalow was situated on the verge of the wood in the country.
After opening the front door I dropped my suitcase in the hall, ""coo-ee,"" I shouted, ""anyone at home?""
Suddenly there was an, ""Oh, hello,"" my sister greeted me, ""I didn't hear you come in."" I collapsed into an arm-chair, 
""Had a good time?"" she asked. You see I was an air-Hostess, ""Yes"" ""I suppose so."" I replied. My sister prefered to stay at home to do the housework and to look after our pet dog, Guy.
Out of my two older sisters I decided to live with this one because we both loved animals and the country and always in the sumer we went for at least one picnic every time I was at home."  Words: 147
