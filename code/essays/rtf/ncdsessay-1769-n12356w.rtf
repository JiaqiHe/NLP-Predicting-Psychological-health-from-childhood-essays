I am now a doctor and have just finished my exams . I have been sent to a little town in the N E. of England calldd (place).
It is a very nice town apart from the few people who think , because I am young I do not knowanything about curing them. For instence , (name).
She lives in a large house just out side the town . as she is a widow she likes a bit of company so (name) (a friend of hers) comes on a Monday and a Saturday . One day when fortunately , (name) was there (name) felt a sudden pain in her eyes and ears and had sit down . although she did not want (name) to phone me , she did and I was there as soon as possible . When I got there I found she needed some eye and ear drops , but she would not let me give them to her . So I had to persuade her to let me give her the ear drops but she still would not let me give her the yee drops So I had to make her look up at the ceiling by telling there was a wasp on the lamp-shad and I popped them in then .
I still swim , play tennis and watch television but as I don't have a piano I have to go to a neighbours to let me play. I sometimes do sewing for charity week, but that is only once a year. There is a committee which I am in and every 3 months we have a coffee evening for the Guides and Brownies .  Words: 277
