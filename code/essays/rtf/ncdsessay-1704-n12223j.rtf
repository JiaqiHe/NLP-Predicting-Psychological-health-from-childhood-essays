"I am going on my new job tomorrow as an Air Hostess and I know I am going to enjoy it. First I will be learning to carry the food and drink to the passengers and then I will go into the aeroplane and it will lift up into the air, the passengers will be dummy's. Next week will be my first flight to moscow. The day has corme and I am very nervous, the first half hour I was doing fine then this big fat man had to corme and spoil it all, he said the other hostess was quicker than you why don't you be a bit quicker. ""Fasten you seat belts please we will arrive at Moscow in ten minuts. When we arrived I got my costume on and went to the open air swimming pool It was such fun then I had to get dressed and go to my hotel the hotel was called Golden star and it was very nice and my room was very nicely furnished and the bed was nice and comfortable too. The day came to go back home but I was sad and glad, I was sad because I had to leave but I was glad that I was going to see my mam because I had been to Moscow for three Months. When I got to our house the house seemed to have changed. Last time it had Honeysuckle growing up the wall but this time it had got ivey growing up too, the furniture had changed aswell last time it was blue leather this time it is white leather with yellow fur seats, but I dont care as long as I have got a home. to live."
