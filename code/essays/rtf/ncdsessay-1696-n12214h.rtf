I work at a car factory. I put the weels on cars. I go to at nine o'clock and come home at five and have my dinner at the canteen at work. I still live at home with my parant's. I will tell you about my work. When the car comes down on the conveyor belt it stop's then me at one and my mate at the other. So I slip the wheel on and fasten safely. Then I put the cap over the nuts and do the same on the other. We have done loads of cars we finish. When I go home I have my tea. Then I chat to my parents about work and other things then I watch the televishon till about seven oclock. Then I go out with my mates to the pictures or somewhere. When I have my sumer holiday's I am going to london to watch my team at wembley. Then I will have a look round london and come home.  Words: 168
