----------------------
I live in a flat with two of my friends. We share the rent money. I get up at seven every morning have my breakfast etc At half past eight I have to be at the factory. I am a secretary for the boss of this firm. My wage isn't all that much but enough. I had been on a course learning the things you need to know when you're a secretary. I leave work at five o'clock and I am at home by five-thirty.
On a Friday I go out with my friends to a night club. We often change our minds and go on a Wednesday as well. As well as going to night-clubs U have other interests as well. I play tennis on a Monday with a tennis club. On Saturday I go to a swimming club where we learn to dive etc. Every Sunday morning I go to church at eight o'clock. My friends go to tennis and wimming aswell.
At home I have other things to amuse me like making myself and my friends dresses. I knit dresses, jumpers and cardigans as well. On a Sunday after-noon as I have no work to do I go for a stroll to the park or a swim. I also like reading adventure or mistery books. I like books espesially that you can't see the ending of. On a Thursday I go and see my mother and we sit and talk about what has happened in the week before us.  Words: 250
