My job is to check things and to train the United States Soldiers; my life is very pleasant it's a hard and touh job. When I am at home the* hour a pass by studying reading and doing thing round the house The interesting about me is when I go to sleep I have a person who want to say that if I could go on duty. In the future life when I get older I wish that I could fly to the Moon on my own opinion it is right to explore space because it is a varst beloved univers which can never end.  Words: 105
