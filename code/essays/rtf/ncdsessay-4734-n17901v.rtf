When I am twenty five years old I would like to be a house-wife and have a cottage in the countryside. I would have a little cat. In my garden I would have a swing chair underneath a lime tree. I would have a red sports car that would go very fast. One child would be nice for me, a little boy, I would call him [male name].
Every day after dinner I would go to town in my sports car and do some shopping, I would take my baby to the clinic and let him be weighed on the scales A pod I would have inmy garden with two lovely white swans. At the back of the garden I would love to have a swimming pool to swim in. When my husband would come home from work we would have our tea outside if it was sunny. I would grow my hair very long so that I could have it in a bun. My friends would come to tea every Saturday. My cottage will have three bedrooms and two atics. When my little boy got older I would buy him a swing of his own. My hobbies would be skating, swimming, tennis and dancing. I would like to be on the televion on Come Dancing. I would have a great deal of friends also my husband would have a lot. On my pool in the garden I would have a bunch of lilly pads.  Words: 244
