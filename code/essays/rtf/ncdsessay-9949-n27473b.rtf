At this age of twenty five I am in the Indian Ocean on a luxury liner as a Navigating officer in the Navy. It's quite a good life in the navy you get around the world alot. I have not seen much of the world yet because I have just come from the [town] Naval colle*ge where I learnt a lot about how to be an officer in the navy. the life at [town] naval college is very good we had yachting * football and other sports as our main hobbies. Now I am board a ship all the time I dont get much time for things like that although I play chess and I am occasionly allowed to play tennis on the tennis courts on board ship. In my quarters I read quite often. I enjoy it most when we stop at other country's and their ports, although our ship goes to most parts of the world. Probably the best places I have been to have been some of the island's in the Pacific Ocean. Sometimes I have to be navigating all night. Back in England I have a wife in [town] where my parents also live. I hope to become a captain by the time I am 30 years old. In some of the parts we stay there for 1 week in others just a couple of days. Normally when we put in at a seaport we get together and have a drink and a good time. During the winter the sea is very rough in some places. Sometimes we are allowed time off to go home for a week or so although I can get [town] from quite a few places in the South of England where we clock in.  Words: 293
