I am [male name] [surname]. I am a history teacher in [school name] secondary modern school. I go to the school at 8 oclock in the morning and go home at half past five in the evening. I teach the boys in the first year, history. I enjoy the work a lot. When I go home I have my tea, and then I usually go up to the library for an hour. I usually get out some books to help me get the next days lesson ready. I then go down to my house. There I prepare the next days lesson. I then mark the exsersies I gave the boys to do. I then get out my stamps and then stick in any stamps I had bought. After I have put my stamps away I turn the telivision on and watch it for a while. I like watching the news espeshely because I like to know what goes on in the world. When I go to bed I usually read part of a book before I go to sleep. I like to go to the pictures. I like watching shaksperses plays but it is not often I see one I am also learning to play chess, but I am not very good at it. On the whole I like my work and I enjoy my play.  Words: 226
