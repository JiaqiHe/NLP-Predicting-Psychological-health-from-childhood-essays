At Collage I am learning to be a footballer. the game is often veryhard, when you get kicked on your foot. I live single in a flat. my friends often come evry weekand when I get spare time I go for a swim at the bath, and some times go for a drive in the country. and for my holiday I go to America and stay there for three weeks.
