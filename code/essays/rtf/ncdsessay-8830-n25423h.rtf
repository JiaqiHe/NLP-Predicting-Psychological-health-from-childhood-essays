I am married, and have two children running round my legs, as I Step into the house after a hard day at work. I am a photographer and sometimes do not see my wife and children for a few weeks. I can remember last year. I had to go to Africa to film and take still pictures of the arriving of Prince Philip who had come over with his family for a tour. At that peticular time I did not see my family for one and half months.
      During my spare time I play Tennis, go shooting, and do some canoeing. In the back yard we have a shooting target which I practise with quite a lot. Although I do not get much spare time it seems as though I am always doing one of my hobbies. Not long ago we bought a bungalow near the [area]. The decorating is really my Job but when my wife feels like it she may pop up stairs and paint a wall or two. Altogether there are four bedrooms my wife and I Sleep in one bedroom and the children (the oldest of which is four) Sleep in one of the other bedrooms. We hope in the future that we will be able to Split the other two bedrooms so that it will make one large room.  Words: 224
