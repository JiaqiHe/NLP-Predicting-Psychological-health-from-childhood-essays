When I am 25 I intend to be a riding instructress with by own stable, o rvet. Deffinetly something to do with animals. With my stable I will have about 15 horses and ponies of different sizes. I shall change 716 per hour. I will have a stable girl who works under me. Every sunday all the horses well be given a rest without Any work all day. If any horses are ill they shall have at least two days without riders. This is so that they can recover property. I shall begin training the horses at the age of three. They will work an hour per day on the lunge. All horses will be broken in at the age of 4. I will enter the best horses and rider for Gymkhanas and horses shows. If I come across a good rider I will let her lunge and school the horses. The horses will be groomed well once per day. No horse will do more that three hours a day. I don't think it is fair for the horse to do more. Whenever horses have been hunting, or at a horse show, when they come back they will be rubbed down. Then tack must be cleaned. If you leave tack dirty it will eventually break and that will be a waste of expense.  Words: 223
