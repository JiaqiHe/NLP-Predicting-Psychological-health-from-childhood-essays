8 o-clock the alarm blares its morning greetings I rub my eyes my bed is to comforable but I fone my weary legs to land on the worn carpet. My wife stirs as her head falls off the soft pillow but she sleeps on. I trudge down the stairs and into the dreary kitchen. I light the fire and put the kettle on to the boil . At half past eight . I left the house and got into my car a ford cortina . I drove along the road till I came to the (college) college . I am an apprecntice electrician. I enjoy my job and hope that I will soon become a qualified electrician when I arrive home my wife has my tea waiting for me .I sit reading the paper as a scrum*tios meal is laid before me Later I left to go up to (place) golf club There I meet two of my friends . On the first tee I had a beautiful drive of two twenty yis. I won the game and came home at ten o clock .  Words: 185
