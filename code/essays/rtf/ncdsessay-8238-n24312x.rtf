My main interest is making models of aeroplanes and flying them. Piloting a V.C. 10 for [company name] is my job. I have no complaints about my job either. I have a wife and no children. About six months aso I was involved in an air crash, I broke two ribs and had to stay away from work for five months, but now I am back at the air-port in Heathrow. My flight is at four-twenty pm in two hours time. I came back from that flight in two weeks. Before I joined [company name] I was a Flight-lieutenant in the Royal Air Force, I then flew a Harrier-jum-jet. I was in command of R.A.F. [town name] until Fighter Command sent a man called Group Captain Kingsley to take over. One year later I gave the R.A.F. up and came to [company name].  Words: 143
