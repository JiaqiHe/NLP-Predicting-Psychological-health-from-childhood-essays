"I come from a middle class home and my main interests are model making and football. I work for (company) as an electrical engineer and I play soccer at right half for the works team. We are doing quite well in the works league as we are sixth from the top. I thor*ghely enjoy this work as it involve computers and not much paperwork. ""My"" computer changes the tickertape into pictures on a screen . If you punch out, ""What are the motions of a car when it hits a wall?"" The answer would be shown as a slow motion picture on the screen. If you film a real car, doing the same thing you will see that the two films are identical. My wife and two children and I have a bungalow in (town), where the air is clean and fresh. It is only a five minete car ride form the beachs and golden sands. My mother & father live in (place), and a quite happy. My two sons are (name) & (name). We have a car and have a continental holiday nearly every year when we go to Spain & Majorca. We get plent of sunny weather down in (town). and it is hardly ever rainy. It is never foggy because the air is so **** as there are no factories and working places for quite a way my works are in (town). From our office you can see the Naval base a few hundred yards away , with its destroyers and other warships. You also see plenty of sailors where we work who are on leave."  Words: 269
