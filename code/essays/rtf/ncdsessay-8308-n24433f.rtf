When I first started work I liked it a lot but some few weeks later I gave it in. I was getting tired of it and looking at the same things every day. I got a job in an office and I like it very much. At home I do the house work likes of doing the cleaning, washing, sewing and knitting. I sometimes go out but very seldom. I am still at my work and I still like it a lot. I do a lot of reading books which I get from the library . I sometimes read the news paper and find some very interesting things .  Words: 109
