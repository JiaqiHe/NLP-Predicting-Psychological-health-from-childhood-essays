I am leading the life of a hair dresser with two children, which are boys, whose names are [male name] and [male name]. My husband is dark haired and five foot eight inches tall, his name is [male name]. We live in a small farm cottage neark [place name?]. For the children and myself we have a fourteen hand chestnut mare whose name is Golden Sparkle. At the week ends I teach the children swimming.
In the evenings I like going to whist drives while [male name] in minding the children and wathing teleivision.
At nine-o-clock [male name] who is five is sent to bed I read to him for ten minuets and the light is turned off.
Earlyer than this at six thirty [male name] is sent to bed as he is only three.
In the summer our family will spend our holiday's partly at my mothers farm and partly on the beach we probably will not go away. Often in the evenings I think back to my wedding day. The day that we decided that we wanted five children.
Ever since then I have led a happy life hair dressing.  Words: 187
