I was 25 last week. I go to work at a electric shop in [city]. In my shop I sell battery*ies a bulbs for cars. I also sell dry battery cells for torchs and torch bulbs. There are electric train sets that I sell at Christmas. I sell model aeroplanes which work by remote control. Behind my shop I have a work shop which I built my self. I use the workshop to mend the model aeroplanes and the electric trainsets. I sell transistors and wirelesses. I also use my work shop to mend the transistors and wirelesses that I sell.
