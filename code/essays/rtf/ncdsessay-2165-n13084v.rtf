I am 25, I work as a hair dresser and I do my mums hair once every fortnight. I still live with mum and I give her, some of my wages. I go out with my friends every night and I like going to the pictures swiming, watching television and listening to pop songs and I have a moter bike and I am learning to drive a car. I am saving up and I am going to open a hair dressers of my own if I can. At home I help mum and I wash and wash up and make beds and tidy and help when I am not at work or out. at work I get xxxx5 a week and I work Monday, Tuesday, wednesday, thursday and half day friday. When I am not at work and not helping mum I go out to the pictures or just look in the shops or go shopping and buy new clothes.  Words: 160
