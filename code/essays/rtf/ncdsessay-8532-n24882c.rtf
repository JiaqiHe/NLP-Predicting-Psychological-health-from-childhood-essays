I play in a football team as outside right. During the time I am not playing football I work in a grocers shop When I am not playing football or working I help my mother at home and do shopping for her on my motes bike I would sometimes go out with my girlfriend to the pictures. In the weekend I sometimes take the family out for a ride in my car, or take them to a park to have a picnic for lunch. In the evenings I sit down and watch television or read a newspaper or a book. Some afternoons or evenings I go to watch a football match. Some evenings I take the family out to a resterant for supper and a drink.  Words: 126
