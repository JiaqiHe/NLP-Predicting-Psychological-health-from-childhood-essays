I have baute a house, but it isn't properly furnished yet. Work is'nt very good but what work I do I get well paid for it, I save six pounds a week.
      My pleasurs are playing football, and fishing and birde watching. I do all the things myself. I sometimes help  with fetes and Gallas and nearly always make and bake things for them. I am often* in the garden.  Words: 70
