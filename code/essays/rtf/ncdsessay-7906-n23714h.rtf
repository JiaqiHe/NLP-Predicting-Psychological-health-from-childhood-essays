When I am twenty five I hope to have just finished training to be a vet at college. I am now helping another vet and after about a year I will set up my own surgery. My friend who wants to also be a vet wants to join me. When I get married I shall marry another ver so that we can work together. I am very fond of cats and birds and I also go horse riding each week. I go to alot of animal films and I enjoy them very much. I would like to live out in the wild where all my animals could roam free.
My cousin lives on a farm and she has many differant animals.
At home now I have five cats and two budgies. I am hoping I will invent something which can stop the cruelty to animals. 
If I am not good enough to be a vet I want to be good at tennis, swimming or horse-jumping. I want three children and a nice big house to live in. I will have to do the house-work when I come home at night or before I go in the morning. Such as feeding all my pets and getting meals. If I did not want to live in a big house I would live on a farm.  Words: 221
