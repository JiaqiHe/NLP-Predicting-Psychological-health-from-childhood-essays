I am working in a store in the City Centre. I leave my house at 8 o'clock. I come home for dinner at twelve o'clock. I come home in the evening at five thirty. With my spare time I go swimming or have a game of tennis with my friend. Every Saturday morning I go shopping Then I have dinner. In the afternoon I do some cleaning or dusting. Sometimes I watch the television or read.
On Sunday's afternoons I usually go for a wlk through the park.
Every Tuesday night I go to the cinema. When I get home make a hot drink for myself, and if it is late I go to bed. Wednesday night I always watch television because my favourite programme is on. While I am working I listen to the radio.  Words: 134
