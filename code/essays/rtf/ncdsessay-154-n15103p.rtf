At last the time had come, I was now 25 and could do what ever I liked. I could go out and get a boyfriend and go to night clubs and stay out till six in the morning and nobody could stop me, but I do like my home life and my mum, dad and sister. And if I did stay out till six in the morning I would be tired to get up to go to work and I would not like to lose my job because its so easy, all's that I do is type out 12 letters a day post them and do odd jobs about the office and I get 12 ponds a week. Any way I'd have to give up stamp collecting and that would brake my heart because I'v got some that are worth a lot of money. And my mum is ill and it would brake her heart if I left her and went of and got married and my dad can't look after her because he's to old and my sister is to young to do every thing about the house. I think I will leave all the surgesting I made in the beguining I think I will leed my life as I have done and carry on with the rest of my family.  Words: 222
