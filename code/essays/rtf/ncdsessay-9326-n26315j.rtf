When I Am Twenty-five.
At the age of twenty-five I would like to be a surgeon and rugby player. If I couldnt be a surgeon I would like to be a teacher. In rugby I would like to play for [rugby football club], and af I could, play for Wales. I would like to go abroad especially to Los Angeles, New Zealand, and Australia, I would also like to go to Spain. I would like to live in [town] where I am living* now, and I would like to have* a pet dog. I was thinking of joining the army but I didn't. If I would gone in the aRmy I woul have liked to have been a foot soldier. At first I wanted to be a foot*baller and play for [football club] but I soon changed my mind. When I am twenty-five I don't know * if I will be married or not. When I am 25 I should like to have a car, if they are still out because when I am twenty-five there might be new cars out, but if there are the same cars out I would like a mini.
I should like to buy some horse's, I love horses but I can't ride them, but all the same I would like to own one or two. When I am getting old I should like to own a farm, in the country.  Words: 234
