I am a pilot and I fly for [airline]. To become one I had to work very hard and study at night. First of all I started off at school with my careers teacher who told us the Jobs the we would be best suited for. He told me that I was suited to be a pilot. So I went to a training school where I learn't what I know now.
      But there was one drawback it was fourteen hundred pound, but I scrapped throuh. Very soon the exan came for me it seemed to last hours, eventualy I found that I had graduated for the Young Pilots Training School. That was where I took my test flight with an expert pilot. Even***lly I did my solo flight, after twenty two terrible hours of training I had made it.  At first every-thing seemed to go wrong but up she went as large and gracful as a swan. Although a Fairy Ganet is only a small plane it has a very heavy tail which made it very difficult to turn. And that was how I gained my wings. I was to fly for [airline] But fly a Fairy Ganet is a from flying a V.C. ten. So back to a training school but this one belonged to [airline] and it was much more advanced. Huge plans of the cockpit and of how it works. One day a letter came through the post. It read ***. Dear Sir we are very glad to be abled to tell you that you have been considered for a [airline] Pilot. And so I got through and [airline] accepted me. And that was I got to whrere I am.  Words: 283
