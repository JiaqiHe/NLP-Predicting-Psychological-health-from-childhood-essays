If I were 25 I expect I will be married and I might even have some child*rren. I might have a job in a factory I would work in an oil factory but that might be dangourous so I don't think Ill work in one. I might work in a garage and be a motor mechanic. I would live in a bungalow with a big garden and a little field so that the children can play on it, and perhaps have a pony so that they can have rides on it, and have a big tree and have a couple of swings and ropes on it and perhaps have a tree house on it. I would be doing my work in the evenings and perhaps discuss some things with my wife. Some nights I would invite some of my friends to have tea, and when we have tea I could discuss buissness matters.  Words: 153
