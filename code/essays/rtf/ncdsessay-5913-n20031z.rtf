When I was ten year old I wanted to be a air hostess, and that is what I am now. I am engaced and I am very interested in swiming and so I've joined a club. I live in my parents house still but I will be moving to [county] when I get marrid. I will of coars move to a nearer airport to do my job. I will not leave my job when I get marrid because I like it so much. I have a dog of my own called Champy it is a pom dog which I am very fond of. I am very fond of animals too. I like reading book and I have about 100 books in my book case at home. I like to hear pop music on the radio. I have a lot of records and I have a record player which I play often. I am very modern and I wear suitable make-up. I don't have arguments with my mother and I am very happy with the things I do.  Words: 177
