I am a school teacher I teach at a school. My main subjects are teaching craft and Jim. and P.T. I am marride and have got to children. Their names are [female name] [female name]-. and [male name] [male name]. They like doing the things that I liked doing when I was small especially climbing trees. [male name] likes playing foot-ball best. I live in a thatched cottage in the contry about a mile up a cart track. I live on a farm with lots and lots of animals. The county is Deven where I was born. People come and stay on our farm, and every morning I get up and milk the cows. It is realy quite a hard life but I still like it. I would go for a short holiday each year. I sometimes whish I could be a guide captin but I have got enought on my mind to think of that. I would go to church every sunday.  Words: 163
