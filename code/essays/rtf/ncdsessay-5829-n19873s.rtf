I have a job as a school teacher. My working hours are from 9 o'clock am to 3.30pm. It is exciting I like watching the little infants running round the play-ground, playing monsters or robots. I live in the town There are many factory's in the town. And in the afternoon after a days work done. I sit, and watch the smoke belowing out of the top of the tall black chimneys. I make my home in some neat flats. The land-lady is a kind old lady her name is Miss Small Every Saturday I clean out my bedroom. Then in the after-noon I go to the supermarket. It is only 10 to 20 yards away. I love to roam round it listening to the lovely music and looking at different ideas. I sometimes try them out. I have some girlfriends and I like to go to **** or **** looking at the gougous clothes then when we come back I ask them in for a cup of coffee a biscuit and a chat Then we try on the dresses we've bought. I like finding time for my hobbies knitting drawing and helping with the Guide company. When I go on holidays. I go with my girl-friends we usualy go to ****. It is super there. I do not intend to get married because I am happy as I am Every Monday night I go to the public library. I like reading and I love browsing about the books. I like window gazing*  Words: 253
