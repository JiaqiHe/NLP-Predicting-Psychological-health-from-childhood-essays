I am now 25 and just about to leave University, when I have left University I hope to get a job as something to do with Science, or I might even go and teach at a school like the school that I used to be at before I left to go to University, I like going to University very much. I still like playing football and most other sport, and would still like to play football or any other sport when every I could, like on a saturday afternoon, but at the moment I play manly Rugby. I play a little Football but not very much. When I come home in the holidays I like to make models of mostly Aeroplanes and Ships I do not like making Tanks because I can never get the thing and little bits in the right place. When I am back at University I spend most of the day doing things to do with Science, I also do quite a lot of Maths and some English in my  time I have left over I do a lot of things to do with History like going around old places and find out what History is atached to the old places I like doing this very much. So I like living this life very much but very soon I will have to look for somewhere to live and a job because my University life is about over and I will probably find this very difficult because I have been use to a different kind of life for so long.
