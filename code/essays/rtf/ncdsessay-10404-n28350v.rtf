If I was twenty five years old I would go and watch football and speedway nearly every time it was held in my home town. And sometimes I would go and watch car racing as well. 
     I would be an enginear and have a lot of money, and have a nice house and a big car. And I would keep the garden nice. And I would go out a lot in my cat, and if I could afford it I would get a new car every two years. And I would keep my car I clean and I would keep it nice inside.  Words: 104
