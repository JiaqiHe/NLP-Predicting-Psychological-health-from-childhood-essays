When I am 25 I hope to be married. I would be a nursery nure if I could. If I had any children I would have a son and I'd call him [male name] [male name], I don't know what our surname would be. For a house I would had a bugalow with the front windows strching from ceiling to the gloor and for my furniture I'd have an inflatable chair and sette. A colour telly with a remote control pannel wich I could carry round and switch on and off without getting up. The telly would be fixed in the wall. In the bathroom there'd be a shower and a bath with a depth of 4 feet and all you have to do is press a button and the bath is filled automaticly. The bedroom will have a bed which would have net curtains all round and a wardrobe fitted in the wall with a place for shoes and special hangers for trousers. Id have long curtains for the bedroom and all you had to do when you wanted to open or close them is pull a cord. For a pet I'd have a St Bernard, a money (spider) and a dolfin. I would call my monkey Mo and my dofin Jo and my St Bernard Titch. For jewelry Id have a pendant watch which told the time and was a radio too, and for my holidays I'd go to the moon. I have many years to wait before I'm 25 and a lot might happen befor then.  Words: 259
