Now I am twentyfive.
I am twentyfive now and I am hoping there will be a happy life before me. I would like an good job so that i would get more money and then I would have exra for savings for new clothing and furniture. When i do get married I would like twin a boy and a girl so they would grow together and I would give them the same cloth and make them look exacly they same. The job I would take up is lorry driving or a steward. I would work hard and always try to be on time when i am going to work. I might even want to work at a factory. These are the places I would like to work at. I would leave (town) and go to live just out side (place) because I prefere ciities than towns. There is one thing I would keep doing is that i would keep doing my favorite hobby. My favorite hobby is saving stamps. I would try to by my own house.  Words: 176
