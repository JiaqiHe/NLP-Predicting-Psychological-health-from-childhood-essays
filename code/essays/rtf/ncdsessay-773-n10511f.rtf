I am now twenty five years old. I am leading quite an ordinary life. I am working as a secretary. My interests are photography and sight seeing. On sunday I took some photo's of Buckingham Palace. I am hoping to get some time tonight to develop them. My home life is quite ordinary I do all my own work. I hope I will be able to continue with my life as I am now doing. My hobbies I carry out at weekends and I manage to do all my housework as well with them. My home is like any other secretaries home I only get a little time to do it in but it still is nice and clean. For my holiday's this year I am hoping to go to Austria and I shall take some photo's and tour it all around. I am going to italy as well. I will have to bring back some present's for my neice's and nephews. I will bring back a diary full of news about Austria and italy. My camera should be able to produce some truth. I will go to collet my tickets for my holiday this afternoon. I will get home an hour early if my boss will let me. Then it shall be the laste of my working day's because I am taking next week off to get my thiings ready because then I shall be off on my holiday to Austria and Italy.  Words: 244
