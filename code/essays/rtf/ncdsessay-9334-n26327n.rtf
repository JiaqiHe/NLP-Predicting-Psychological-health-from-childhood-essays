I live in a cottage at the edge of [lake] Lake, in [area]. At the side of my house is a barn with a big store of hay and sacks of all sorts. This is where I keep my horse, of sixteen hands. Also I keep a ram, a eve, and a little lamb. My husband works in [town] for [company name] shoes limited. When he has gone to work a about eight o'clock in the morning, I feed the animals and clean out their beds. This takes about two and a half hours. Then (in the summer) I take a swim, (and in the winter), I do some sewing or washing. After all that is finished I make myself some dinner. Sometimes after dinner I go over to my best freinds house. She live two likes away from us, and the road is terrible to go over. There are pot holes, and large stones, sticks, and bits of glass all over. Well if I get over there safley I sometimes help her on her farm. Sometimes I ride my horse, Gazelle over there on the edge of the road, where there is a grass verge. If I do ride her, my friend and I go for a ride over the farm. My shopping is done in the afternoon, and my friend comes with me to sell her eggs. I do my shopping in the village of [village]. My husband comes home at six o'clock, we have our supper, then read, or watch television until bed time.
My interests are;
