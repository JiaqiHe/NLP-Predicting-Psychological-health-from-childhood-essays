"""Fourth row lead out"" This is a junior school, and I am a teacher. It is the year 1983 and I am twenty five years old. The life I lead is a busy one, teaching and helping the children. At this time it is playtime for the next quarter of an hour. When at four. o'clock I leave for home, I am sure to find that all the everyday household jobs are waiting to be done. Cooking, washing, ironing and cleaning are part of my everday life.
Today - April th 29th 1983 is the day that the launching of lunar rocket 12 will be taking place. But in this day and age rocket launching is quite an ordinary thing.
My house is a large bungalow, and it is situated about half a mile from the school. Inside the bungalow is a kitchen, a dining-room, a lounge, two bedrooms, a bathroom and a playroom. First the bedrooms. Each bedroom has two beds - when a button is prested - the beds fold back into the walls. Apart from this it is quite an ordinary house. So ends my story of one day in my life."
