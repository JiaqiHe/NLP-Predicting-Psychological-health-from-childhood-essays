----------------------
I am an engineer for the air-force, it is an interesting job and not borying. I breed budgies which I carried on from a boy, which I am very interested in. Another of my pleasures is grass track racing. At home I spend my time cleaning out the birds, when I am away my wife looks after them. I am not at home all the time as my job takes up quite a bit of time. My house is in the country slap in the middle of a wood. I live here for one reason because it gave me enough room to build a big avairy. Another is that I like the quiteness. I like dancing and nearly any kind of sport. I do not like a lot of society. I can fly a jet a bit, and am trying to improve so that I do not have to stop on the ground. I am quite wealthy and do not smoke. I have two other animals a dog and a terapin. The dog is an alsation and quite fierce at that. My house is not very bit but I don't mind. Amp my dog its six pound of meat a day. When I am away Amp prowls around the house, his not afraid of any thing.  Words: 216
