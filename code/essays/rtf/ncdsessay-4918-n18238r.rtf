I have gone America on bussiness for a year and do not like it as much hear as in England I work for [company], and we are building part of a power station here. We have rented a house and in England my wife and I have a manshion in [town]. 
      I am interested in trains as I have bean since I was young. I had a model layout when I was 11 years old, but my son has got it now, and it still works like new.
      When I joined [company] my dad retired and I took over his position as second boss and now I get quite good pay of 5,000 a year which is extremely good really. We are living in New York and having a nice time, we come back in the autumn as soon as I have finished my bussiness over hear. I have a perfectly normal life and I am quite satisfied  Words: 159
