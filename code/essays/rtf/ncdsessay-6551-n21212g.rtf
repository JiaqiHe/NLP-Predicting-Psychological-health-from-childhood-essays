I am a music teacher at a school and teach music to people round about me. I enjoy this very much and hope to be in an orchestra some day. I started to learn music when I was nearly seven and a half years old, since then I have been in a few music festival's.
I live in (place). I live in a flat with my husband and two children one who is called (name) and the other whois (name). I used to live in (place) nearly eight miles out of (place), and I went to (place) and then went to (place). Since then I have lived here in (place). 
At home I just do the housework and listen to Baithoven's pieces and many other pieces done by famous musicians. I also have started to teach my children the first steps of music. They hope to be able to play just as well as me when they grow up.
My husband who like`s music as well plays in the orchestra but he doesn't play the piano he plays the violin. We have often been asked to play duets and of course we accept*.
I think I am going to lead a very happy life and just keep playing the piano.  Words: 207
