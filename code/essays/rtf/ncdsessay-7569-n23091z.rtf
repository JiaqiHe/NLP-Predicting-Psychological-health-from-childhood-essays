"Today is my final examination to be a qualified teacher. The world starting at the eleven plus. From experiences at school I know how people feel if everyone gets the blame or punishment that one person brings about. If I pass this examination I shall never look back at it but, go straight on. My studies started with a flaire for knowing what went on in schools. I always used to ask people what they thought about school, or whether they liked the teacher or if they didn't ! It is hard to please everyone and to risk temptation of getting annoy*ed. The main trouble in school children's behaviour is talking. When people are older they seem to say in lessons that people waste time of the lessons talking, but in my view if you set aside a time for talking or be nice to children they begin to respect the teacher, and they do what they're told, but, on the other hand if the teacher is constantly shouting at them they say ""oh I can't be bothered to be quiet"" Which is a little rude, but that is what most children think. If I pass the examination I shall look forward to seeing if my theory comes true, I wonder if it will, I think it is true"  Words: 219
