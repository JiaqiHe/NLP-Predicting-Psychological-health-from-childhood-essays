I live at [town]. at the '[house name]' [street name]. I teach at a little school at [suburb]. Every day from Monday to Friday I get up at half past seven and have my breakfast and go to school. When I am at school Mrs [surname] comes and dusts the house in the morning, so that it is nice and tidy when I come back in the evening. I teach a class of twenty eight children between four and a half and six and a half. Our school has family grouping, so we have four classes. The children who have just started school play with yoys that help them to learn how to count, while the others learn how to read, and write. In the evening when I get home I have my tea and then I sit down and read the paper or watch television.  Words: 146
