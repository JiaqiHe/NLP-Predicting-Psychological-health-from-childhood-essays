At the age of twenty-five I would like to be a teacher because being a teacher seems to me to be a different job. I also don't like the idea of leaving school when I am about sixteen. Also when I am twenty-five I hope to be playing for either [city] City or [town] Town. If I do go to collage I would like to go to [university] collage York. If I do go to York  Words: 76
