I am working to be a riding instructress at a near-by school. I have my own pony and I learnt to ride when I was 11. I enter horse and pony competitions trying to win money to pay for my eduction. I would like to be an instructress I have a great love for horse and ponies. When I am not riding or being educated I am exercising my two dogs (a labrador and a dalmation) I would like to marry soon, as I have Quite, a nice future ahead of me. When I have taken my two exams to become a Qualified instructress I shall be able to own my own stable and teach people of all ages how to ride. My two favorite ponies are Rusty who is now 21 years old the Pony I learned to ride on, and Flicka who is a young six year old I also have two other ponies but they are in foal, Spring and Mrs Jingles. The way I keep all my ponies going is to bred Spring or Mrs. Jingles (as they are my best mares) to my sisters stallions and I then sells the foals. I hope after my education is finished and I am married to have my own stables or stud, but this all depends on how my education goes and if the person I marry can afford to keep horse and ponies. I often wonder what would happen if I did not pass my exams but I should still keep up my life with horses even if I just had to live on bread on water, so that they could be fed and looked after.
