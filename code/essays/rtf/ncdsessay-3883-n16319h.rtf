"My name is [name] I am 25 and I am teaching at [school]. My interests are music, English, Poetry and History I have got a diploma for music and often conduct an orcestra. I dont have to teach the children as I have a Robot called Gum.boots who does it for me. I am very unpuntuel and very don't caresh. Often I get bored at home so I write poetry and stories in my free time. I have also had one book published called. ""The day that the controls broke down"". My husband is a Robot controller and his name is [name]. Every year I go up to the moon to teach the moon children about the life we are leading on earth. They are very cute really although some people say they are ug*ly but I dont think so, they wear red trousers and Green hats with coats to match. My favourite drink is sea-weed* and my favourite food is leaves with stalks and flowers (I like blue flowers best.)
I have no children and no sisters but I have five brothers. all of them older than me. Well ' I suppose I had better go and get Gum-boots and get him working."  Words: 203
