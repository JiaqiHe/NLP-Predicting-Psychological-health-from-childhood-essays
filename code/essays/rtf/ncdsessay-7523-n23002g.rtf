I am now twenty five years old. I work as a typist at the County offices I have a bungalow in [village]. The bungalow itself is a fairly big one. My hobbies are swimming and stamp collecting. I also like looking after babies in the afternoons as I only work part time. I only look after babies if mothers go out to work. The age of my looking after babies is the one year olds and under. My stamp collection is a very big one. It is a fairly thick book and is nearly full. In fact it is so full that no more leaflets can fit in. I feel now I would like to be back at school for the time that passes on. Now that I only do half a days work the time goes really slowly in the afternoon. But even so I enjoy to be at work. It is just nice really as I can get the house work in the afternoon like for instance dusting. I find the work in the house quite hard work but I do like the house to look clean. From the bunglow where I live to the office it is quite a long way I catch the quarter past eight bus and I arrive at the office about quarter to nine each morning. It will just give me nice time to have a sit down with my friends and talk before I start my work. At night when I am free it is nice to have a sit down and watch television like the corner family and the comedies. Sometimes when there isnt much on television I read on of the books from the book shelf. But I don't think I would like to work full time  Words: 297
