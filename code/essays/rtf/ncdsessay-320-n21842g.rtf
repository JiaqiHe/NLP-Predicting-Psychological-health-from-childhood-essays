I am 25 I have a job of an electrision at a garage I live in a town where all the shops are for food. I like reading car [illegible] in my spare time I like building boats out of wood when there is nothing to do in the house or the garage. My hobbie is fishing Ive got a nice house a big garage for my car. We dont miss any bill I pay them as they come. It is a comfortable place I have no problems about my work or any thing I am getting enough money I am not realy bothered as long as I get enough to keep my house as it is.  Words: 117
