Today I got into trouble at work because as I was typing on the typwriter, it was edging to the end of the table, in the end it fell off. The boss was so mad that he sent me to the stamping room. Although the boss dosen't like me I ejnoy my job, working in the post office tower in London is one of the best jobs. At home when I get bored I go into my bedroom and do some of my tests that will help me look for gobs if I am redundant. I am doing very well in these tests I have had 3 good marks 100%/100% and 89%/100% and 97%/100% which is very good.
On Sundays I play football for the post office team and in the close season watch cricket. When theres nothing for me to do I often read a book I usually read thrillers by Agatha Christie but I sometimes read war stories.
When I am on holiday I like going abroad last year I had a nice holiday in Spain it was very interesting. I still go to clubs but this time as head of a intermediate youth club between the age of 11-14 I like camping it makes me feel tough like steel.
I have a lot of time off work because I only work an 8 hour day 9 till 12 and 1 till 6 on a Set Rate pay of xxxx5 a week which means I get xxxx20 a month. I like thinking back to when I was elleven, I had played football with a ball with a hole in it on a ten yard long pitch. I didn't know then but those were the best day of my life.  Words: 288
