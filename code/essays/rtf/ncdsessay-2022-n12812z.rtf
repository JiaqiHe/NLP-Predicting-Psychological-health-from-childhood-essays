I am at the age of twenty five and I am working in a hospital. My job is night watching. In my spare time when I am not working in the hospital I like to sow and make dresses. Other times I just listen to the radio. I live in a cottage out in the country because* the town is to noissy. The life living in the country is very nice in summer and I hear all the summer sounds and the flowers in the fields look very pretty.  Words: 89
