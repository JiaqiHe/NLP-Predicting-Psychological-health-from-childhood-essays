At the age of twentyfive I am playing football for a proffeshional football club. I am proparing for life after my footballing carrer as a enginear. I live in England with a family of three one boy and two girls. The boy is three years of age and the girls are twins of one and a half years old. I have a family car and have had for two month. On sundays before we do any other thing we go to mass. When I have changes I often take my boy out the back garden and have a kick around with a ball which I like to do. The two girls watch. After we have dinner we all have a walk in the country-side looking at the animals Each saturday I play a first class game of football. I am the goal scorer, that is really what I am for. I like to do training at home as well as at the club. I play for Everton which is a very good club to play for. My wife and children come to see me playing each week. On thursdays there is a club for the players, wives, and any friends. Sometime my wife and I go out to dinner or the pictures at night. Any time anyone come to visit us for a few days we take them to a place we sometimes dine.  Words: 234
