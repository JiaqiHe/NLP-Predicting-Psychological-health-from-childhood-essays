I am now 25 years old and I have a wife and children of my own. I am a racing driver and I have been to many formula I car races. I have a cooper masserate racing car and a rover 2,000 salloon car. I have some cups and medals from winning races. I still collect stamps and I have got lots of stamp albums and stamps. I have got old stamps that I have managed to save from my age of 11, I own a shop (cafe). I have a big cottage in the country and some land where I have ratrack to race my cooper on. I have a brother and sister who have children and I usually lett them come to watch me go fast round the track. I go round on tours with other racing drivers. At one time I didn't know if. I would ever make a good racing driver. 15 years ago Jim clark died in a crash while he was driving in a race. Sometimes I have a little game of football for fun with my children. My mother and father have got a home in the country as well I started driving at the age of 17.  Words: 205
