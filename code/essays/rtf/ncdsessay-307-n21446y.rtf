I like the work I am doing it is very interesting, I like the life I am leading, I have many interests one of them is takeing the dog for a walk, and at the age of 25 I can run and play with him. In the mornings I have to go to work at half past eight and come home at 6'o clock. On Saturday's I would go out and buy the shoping and after that I go and buy some clothes, but I would not buy clothes every Saturday. I get payed £6.10.bd on Thursday's. My work is a Shop Keeper.
