I am interested in horses and I would like to work with them I would like to live in charing in an old little cottage enough for my two children and wife. I would like to have two children because it is less to feed and they would keep each other compony. I would not spoil them and bye lots of toys for them bothe. I would like one of my children to be a girl, and nuther a boy. I would like to get a Jod on a farm which breeds horses. Id like to groom them down and take them for exercise every day. I would like to take out a white one best. In my spare time I would colect stamps. And write the letters that I have to writ. I would like to race the horses. When I am older Id like to breed my own horses. And let my children help if they wanted to.  Words: 160
