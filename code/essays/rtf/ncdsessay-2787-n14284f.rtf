I enjoy living at the age of 25 I live a life as an international footballer. I get on very well with my football coach. I train very hard with him. He has tought me quite a few football tricks in the past years. I have had thirten caps as an international footballer. I play for (team) my position is centre foward my team mate is (name) he plays left wing. Things have changed ripidly the cars don't run on wheels any more the run on air they are called hover cars . The house are built of class all over when you go to bed you just have to push a batoon and the glass steams up. It is unbreakable class they put in so it can't be smashed . In the schools they have computer to teach the pupils how to use them. The football pitches Don`t have grass any more they have atifushal grass that can`t be ripped up and the players don`t get muddy. Its like a new world the way things have changed.  Words: 178
