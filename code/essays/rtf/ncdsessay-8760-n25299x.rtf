My life is a good life I enjoy my work I enjoy my spare time I like playing football and Rugby I like to go swimming. My job is art I like painting pictures of the country side and of the harbours when I go on holiday I usually go to [town] and [town]. In my spare time I go swimming and play Rugby for my club. I live in a big house with a very big garden I have a car it is a cortina. When I have a few weeks rest I take my family to [town] for a week and to [town] for two weeks, in my car. While I am there I sometimes paint pictures of the harbour and on the night I paint the amusements when all the colourful lights are on. I keep some of the pictures and I sell some of them and I usually make a profit on them.  Words: 157
