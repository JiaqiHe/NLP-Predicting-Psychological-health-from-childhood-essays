When I am 25 I might be a stealworker . I will be a supervisor like my dad is. I think it will be good . My house will be near (place). I hope it will bee good. I have been down there before it is a big work. My house will have a bright coloured walpaper and a lot of furniture. My house will have an electric fire . I am not going to get married . when I am twenty five or under mebey when I am older. I hope the job is good for if I have anyluck I might be able to go to (place) like my dad nearly got.
I think I will like the work supervising on the big plateforms. Every year there is a dance which ever year there is a man who drowns himself with beer. The works are clean in some parts but in other parts it is not to clean. In my spare times I will go fishing and catch a fish for my tea. and at night I will do some capatery form the wood I brought home. I like to have a good *lection of colour-ful stones to study them. I will have a ten pound telescop to see all different planets with and sta*  Words: 216
