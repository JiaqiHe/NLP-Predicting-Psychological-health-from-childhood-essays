----------------------
I am at University taking (Medicine and Mathematics) as my subjects for being a Lady Doctorr. I come home at weekends to visit my parents. I have a small mini and am taking my driving lessons. When I leave I am going to rent a small flat in London where I shall work for a couple of years and then I shall come home if I do not like it and if I am not married by then. I enjoy swimming and have a lot of books. I bought a sewing machine and I am now making some lovely dresses for the summer. I am also knitting a few sweaters and cardigans for my holidays I think I will go to Canada and America I am getting on very well at University and I will leave in a year. I have a small amount of Premium Bonds and have quite a lot in the bank I am still writing to my four penfriends and when I go to London I shall visit one of them. Every Monday night I go to the tennis club. I still write poetry and some of it has been published  Words: 195
