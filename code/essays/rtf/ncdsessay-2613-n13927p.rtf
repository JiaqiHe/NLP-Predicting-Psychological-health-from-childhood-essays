I go up to my mother's every saturday and sunday My children go to a nursery. i go to town some saturdays About once a month I go to , see some of the girls I used to go to school with , some are marred some are not. The girl is two and the boy is three.
The nursery is near the hospital so when I come home form work I take them home at half past four. I do not smoke and I donot drink, if I drink it will be pop.
My husband is a bank maneger. When my children are five they will go to Irish dancing.  Words: 126
