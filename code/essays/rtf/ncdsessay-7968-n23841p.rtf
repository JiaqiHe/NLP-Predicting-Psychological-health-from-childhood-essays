I think I would like to be a hairdresser, or a typist. I would go to work every morning and every afternoon. I might be marrid and I might have some children Sometimes at night I might go out, I would clean the house at night time, I would not clean it every night. Some nights I would wash the clothes If I was married I would not have a house to big I would have three bedrooms in the house, a kichen, a front room and a living room and a middle room. I would go to work a nine in the morning, and come home at 12 o clock. I would go at 2 and come home a 5 o clock. The place were I work would not be to far away.  Words: 134
