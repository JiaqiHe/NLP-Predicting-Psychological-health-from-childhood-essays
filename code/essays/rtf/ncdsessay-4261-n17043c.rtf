"      My Life
My name is [name] and I am a teacher at the [school] in [county]. My day is spent teaching small children eight to nine years old. My home is a small farm of twelve acres called ""[farm]"" so I am a small farmer as well. I have fifty sheep and some hens and three* Welsh black cows. In my spare time I feed the hens and before breakfast I milk the cows and at 4.30 I milk them again. If somethiing has kept me late at school my mother would* milk the cows. On Saturday morning some of the boys in my class come up and help me to* tidy up. On Saturday afternoon I go and watch [football club] football team and sometimes I play for them as a reserve.
      On Sunday I get up half past eight I do my usual look around the farm and then I put my best suit on on and I go to chapel. After chapel time is over I go and get our Sunday newspaper. If I had time I would do a bit of gardening. In April I would turn one or two fields over to put potatoe seeds in the soil, and when they are ready I would sell them. I enjoy my work very much teaching the children and caring for my anemalls"  Words: 226
