I have got a good job and a new car. And I am paying for a house. I work in a telivisoin Shop repairing telivisoins. I am not married jet so I have to cook my own meals but, Sometimes I go out for a meal for a change or I go to one of my friends. When I come home I watch teleivisoin or read a book. Somtimes on a weekend I go to one of my relastions.  Words: 79
