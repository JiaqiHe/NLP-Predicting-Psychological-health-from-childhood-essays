I am 25 years old, I am a typist in an office on the top floor of a 15 storey building, in the middle of London. I start work at 9' o'clock in the morning and finish at 6' o'clock. Sometimes I have to go to the post office to collect letters, and parcels, but not often. I have an offive to my self, but sometimes I a girl come and watch me. I have to get up very early in the morning to give me time to get ready, for the days work, and get my breakfast. I catch the 8' o'clock train to London. I live in [town], I have lived in [town] all my life. Sometimes I finish after 6'oclock In my office I have a desk, type writer, telephone, cupboards, blue wallpaper and carpet. I have an assistant, which comes in from 10'o'clock till 5'o'clock. Most of the time I type but sometimes I have to show my assistant what to do. When I have spare time like my day off I play tennis in the summer. and ice hockey in the winter. On weekends I have not go much time I go to work on Saturday.  Words: 201
