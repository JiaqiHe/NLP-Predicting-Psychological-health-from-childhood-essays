"It is my twenty-fith birthday today I have just come home after going on a course for civil engineers. I have recantly bought a house and I owe my father some money which he loaned to me. I haven't a girl friend and I live on my own, so the house is too big for just me so I have let another man from the same course rent it from me so I can slowly pey back my debt. I hope to join my fathers firm soon although I may not work in the same office. 
      I am thinking of selling some of my stamps because I haven't very much money at the moment, and also because I cannot be bothered to sort them out into countries and sets.
      I sometimes go out with my friend who lives below me but we can't very often because we both have to study most of the time to get our ""A"" levels. When I received the results of the A levels my father gave me a present of an old car and a new sailing dingy so I can go racing at a sailing club every weekend."  Words: 196
