I have quite a few pets a horse 2 dogs 2 cats 5 goldfish and that is all. I do not have any children because I am not marride In my spare time I usually go swimming or play football and in the summer I play cricet and g* horse riding. I have got an Austin Mini traveler I live in a house. In the weekends I usually go to a friends farm for a holiday. At the farm their are lots of intresting things there are lots of coars* the best thing is plowing the fields and driving the tractor. Its nice taking the hay and stacking it in the hay loft for the winter. Then we usually go in for a nice lunch. and afterlunch we go and milk the cows and take the milk to the dairy. And then I go home.  Words: 291
