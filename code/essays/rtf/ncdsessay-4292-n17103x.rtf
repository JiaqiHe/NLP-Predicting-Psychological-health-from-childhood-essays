I am twentyfive years old and I live in Manchester. I support Manchester Unicted FC. and on Saturdays I go and watch them play. I am studing to be an Electronic engineer and I live in a house with a lady called Mrs [surname]* she is very nice and she has three children called [male name], [male name], and [male name]. I like [male name] the best because he also supports Manchester United and he comes up in my bedroom and we sit and talk about football. My best friend at the collage is [male name]. He is rather tall and he lives in Liverpool and he supports Everton, sometimes we have arguements about football but we alway make up friends again. I have two brothers and one sister there names are [male name] he is 32 years old, [male name] he is 25 years old (we are twins) and [female name] who is 28 years old. We are Roman Catholics. One of my hobbies is writing poetry here is one of my poems. I love the Ducks upon the lake

But best of all these things I love
Is the Heaven above.
My other hobbyes are swimming and football.  Words: 202
