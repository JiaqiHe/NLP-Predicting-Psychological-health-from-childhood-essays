I really am luckly I have got a lovely house with a big garage and big garden Also I have a lovely family willing to help in any way they can When I come home after a hard days work there is always a warm house and a warm meal waiting for me. I am a policeman, my job on the policeforce is to drive a pander car, I also play for the police football team Being a policeman is a hard time, sometimes you might be called out, not often though. Mainly its driving round in the car keeping a eye on shops and banks Nightimes the worse because the crimals can get round the back of some shops and you can't see them Thats the lot about the work I do, Sundays a day I like because I take the family out for the day in my own car Sometimes we go and play golf, sometimes a Sunday League criket match, other times the family watch me play criket or football. The few Sundays we don't go out I do odd jobs round the house like putting new floor boards in and new hings of doors. In the evenings I have not got to go to work I sit back in my armchair and watch the television, sometimes I read or listern too the radio. I do not get much time for gardening unluckly, I do that on the Satuday afternoons I have off witch is about efree fortnight  Words: 251
