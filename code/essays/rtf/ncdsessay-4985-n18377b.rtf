I am married with a 2 year old boy. My name is Mr. [name] My wife is called [name]. I am a proffesional footballer and play for Manchester City. Every weekday I own a furniture shop in Preston and I have some good customes such as The mayor of Preston etc. I like 'pop' music especially The 'Who', but my wife likes classical music. My hobbies are train spotting and aircraft spotting. I also like sunny holidays. (Not G.B. for sun!) I like a good musical comedy, but a cinema production is better  Words: 93
