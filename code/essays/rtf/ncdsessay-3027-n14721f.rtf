I shall do light training nearly every day except saturedays when I shall be playing in a football match or* be nursing a injury. About 3 o clock in the afternoon I shall go home to rest. If a match is postpond I shall do training while my Manager should go and see a team and see if there is any good players, which will sign on. At night if there are no matches I shall watch television or if there is a team which were a going to play on satureday or* any other day I shall go and watch them if they are playing. After a match I shall most probably go to my car. If we have won the cup, gained promotion or got out of relagation we would celebrate with champaine. If I am not satisfied with my team I shall ask to be transfered to another club. I might win the player of the year award, I am not married. I live in [town] near the football ground so I can get to the [meadow] easilly. I am not going to get married because if I have a transfer I shall have to move house but living with my Mum and dad I only need to take clothes because I could rent a flat, Sometime I play football with my friend. Sometimes I go to the cinema to watch a film. I dont go out often. I have one dog. I take my dog for walks and feed him.  Words: 254
