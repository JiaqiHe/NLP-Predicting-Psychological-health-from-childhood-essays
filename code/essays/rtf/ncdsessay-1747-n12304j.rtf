I would like a wife who under-stand me. and I under-stand her but I would'nt like her to know every-thing about me other wise life would be a drag for her (or boring) I would be fussy about what kind of wife I have. I would'nt want a job of to high a Standerd, but Something Simple and good enough pay to keep the family well and healthy. I would 'nt mind being a football, but if I was I would'nt get married. If I got Sick of life I would take up a hobby like golf, tennis, boating, camping or any other hobby that interest's me. If my wife did happen to take ill I would look after her well (and the house) and not get bad tempered. with the kid's. I will not Smoke. I don't think I would want anything about me to change, by my point of ' view I just as good as I am. I like meeting new freinds, and if I were to buy a house it would not be a council house. The house would be in the county, nothing big but a quaint little cottage. I would be the handy man around the house. I would buy a car for long journys but if where I work was about 4 - 5 miles I would walk or other wise use the car. I would take the wife out to the coast when I get the chance or take her to a dance etc, etc, Of course I would need a telephone if we were the only cattage for miles around. I would teach my wife how to drive so she can to the shopping in the town while I'm at work. I would also keep the children happy and give them pocket-money.  Words: 301
