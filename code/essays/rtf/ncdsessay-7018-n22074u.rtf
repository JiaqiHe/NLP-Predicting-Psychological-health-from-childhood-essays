When I am older I am going to be a coachdriver for ****, going all over Britain. I take trips to football matches. I like the work I am doing because you can go to places when you take people on trips, like going to the zoo, parks, circuses. My life I am leading is not very easy but it is quite good, because I only work MON: TUE THUR: SAT: And I have a job on a wednesday as a clown at ****. In my spare time I clean the coach what I have usued* and clean the seats. At night i watch Television and go to bed at 11 o'clock.  Words: 112
