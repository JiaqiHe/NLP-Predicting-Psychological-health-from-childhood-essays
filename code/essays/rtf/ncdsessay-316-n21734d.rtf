I would like to be a farmer out in the cuntry it would be nice and quiet. I would not have to put up with all the noise that there is in towns. I would get up about six oclock and go and milk the cows and then I would feed the pigs and get the fresh eggs from the hen house after that I would go and get my breakfast I would have bacon and eeg and a fresh cup of milk after that I would let the cows out to pasture in the gross and then I would ploug the field and go into town for my messages and I would by some cows at the cattle market I would by some sheep. It was time to shave the sheep Iwould cut thier tales of and afterr that I [illegible fiche - would] milk the cows I would collect stamps in my spare time and I would live in a small cottage.
