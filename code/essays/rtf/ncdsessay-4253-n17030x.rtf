There is three things I want to choose from. I might go in the army for a few years, I might be an artist or a draughtsman. I will most proberly choose when I am twenty five. I'll most proberly have a home somewhere in England. I,ll still be collecting stamps, coins, and postcards. If I can't get any of the jobs I mentioned Ill most proberly get another good job. Or I might go to College or University.  Words: 79
