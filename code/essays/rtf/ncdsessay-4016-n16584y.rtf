----------------------
I now live in a flat of my own and I work as a teacher in a near by school the children who I teach are just over five years old. They are all very sweet and afectunate. I work at the school all day having my lunch there. When the children go home at night I stay behind and pin up pictures and get things ready for the next day. When I get home I make myself a small meal. When I have done this I either change into my best dress and go out with my boyfriend who's name is [male name]. We are already engaged and hope to be getting married sometime during the next year. If I am not going out with [male name] I sometimes clean out the flat or do some sewing or kniting while I am listening to records. During holidays I tour the country and sometimes I go abroad. But when I am not doing either of these I go into town and buy myself a new dress and other important things which I nead once a year when my flat is getting a bit shabby [male name] helps me to decorate it and change the furniture around a bit twice a year I visit my mother and father to see how they are and once a week I send them a letter and my mother always writes back. The rent for my flat is five pounds a year and I get a weakly payment for teaching of nearly twelve pounds.  Words: 259
