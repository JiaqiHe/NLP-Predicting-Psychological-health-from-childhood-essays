When I am 25 years old I would like to have a lovely home I would like to live in a bungalow and have a lovely dog. I would like to be a secretary because I enjoy typing . I would also like to go crueses all over the world and see how other people life . I would also like to have a car to be able to go places and runs if you get fed up. If I g*t eny children I would like to have 1 boy and 1 girl so that you can keep them lovely . If I had any children I would not like to spoil them because if you spoil them they are sometimes very cheeky and think that if they want anything they just need to ask an expect to get it . I would also knit and sew a lot of things . After I have seen some other place* where people live I might like to live abroad . If I liked the way they live but if I didn't I woud just be happy to life where I was . I would like to live somwhere where it is not to hot and dosn't alw ways rain. I would like my children to have manners and not be rude to grown ups. I would also visit my parents and help them if they are in difficulty I would have them staying whith *e* at the weekend and I would get my mums messages in . I would take my mother and father away for days to the seaside so they dont have to be stuffed up in the house all day long . I would like my life to be very joyful and happy .  Words: 296
