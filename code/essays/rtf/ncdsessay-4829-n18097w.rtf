I have just got a job in a shoe makers shop. I am only just learning the work, but I am beging to catch on. The manager is a nice sort of chap and he does everything he can for me. I am living in a flat at the moment with my wife and my two children, [male name] is 9 and [female name] is 8 and they have a little dog which is called rex. I don't get much on the work I'm doing but we make do with it. We have not got a cat but we still go on the beach and out on the moor's and places like that. Every Saturday we go up the road to se emy mother and father. On friday we go out for a drink at the Golden Hind, and the lady across the road looks after the children.  Words: 148
