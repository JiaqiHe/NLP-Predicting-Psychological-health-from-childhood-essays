I am 25 years of age, I work very hard as a nurse. Im marrid, I have 2 chrildren there names are [name] and [name]. I like to take them swimming and any where they like. When there old enuf I will send them to a nice school they will wear a newniform because I think chrildren look very smart in uniforms. My husband works as a policeman, while I am at work my mother comes round at 9 o clock and takes the chrildren to a nursery round the corner, then I go to work. When I come home, my chrildren are usely waiting at the door.  Words: 108
