I would try to get a good job. I would try three or four jobs, If I did not like them I would try to join the .R.A.F. I would like to be in the band and play a drum. I would like to do this, because I play the drum at school to hymns. I would have a bungerlow in the country and have a moter bike to travel to work. I would also like to fly an air craft, and I would like to have an Gnat of my own, and at the weekend I would like to fly it around. I would like to collect stamps and stick them in an album.
