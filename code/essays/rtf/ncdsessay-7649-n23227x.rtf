We have just built an amials home one section is the animals home the other it our home. Sometimes we go to London and Birmingham to get special mediacnes for the animals and food and we buy clothes for our self*****. Sometimes we go for day trips. A lot of people buy our animals because they can trust us if they find a animal hurt they always give it to us.  Words: 227
