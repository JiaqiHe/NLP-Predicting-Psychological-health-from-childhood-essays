When I am 25 chemistry is important to me because it is what I am going to do. (I hope) I would live in a semi detached house with three bed-rooms. I hope to have a family and only two children. I would leave my children in the care of a redistrad child minder while I go to work. I will learn to drive and have a car. (a Estate car if possible) I would come home from work at half past 4 and get tea ready. I would pay the child minder £3 a week. (or 3005 because of the decimal system) When my children go to school I would help them a little bit (not to much) with they home work at weekends we shall go down to the forset. (on Saturday_ and have picnics. For birthday treats I will let my children pick were they want to go I would let there imagenation ran free and won't laugh at them if they belive in fairys I will let the pick there own holidays. (as long as there not to expensiv BUT I wouldnt let them run to free. I would care and look after them untill they are to old to be looked after when they have a family I would help them all I can I would'nt fuss to much at all. and I'd let them had a wonderfull and exicinting life.
