I am in the Air Force and I am a profesional pilot. I won my wings a year ago. I am married and I have one child who is a boy. I am very interested in aircraft and I make models of them. I do not drink or smoke so I am well off with money. My rank in the Air Force is a Pilot Officer. The aircraft I fly are the Anglo French Jaguar, strike fighter and trainer. Breifing before flying takes about two hours atogether and when you land you have to be debreifed.  Words: 96
