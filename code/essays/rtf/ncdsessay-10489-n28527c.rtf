My name is Mrs ****. I am 25 years old, I have a husband who goes to work every day from 7.30am till 5-0o'clock pm, I also have a son 1 year old and a dauter 6 month old. On the 20th of November it is my sons birthday and on the 10th of October it is my dauters birthday. Every morning when I get up I have to Ian his bottle of milk and give him a bath Jane does not wake up until 9 o'clock and is very good. My husband gets up at 6 o'clock and does the washing for me while I dust round the house and get the milk ready for ian and Jane. When they have both had their milk they go to sleep untill 2oclock, they go to bed about 5 o'clock just after their daddy has come home.  Words: 146
