I am married I have no children so we can go out a lot that is why my life is so vere interesting. We are all ways going out to new places and meating new people but while this is all happening we are still hoping for children and to settle down in a little cosy house. We are allso hoping that one day we can buy a little cottage in the country. Becouse at the momant we are living in a big city. I expect we would be a bit bewildered with the new surrounding but we would get used to it in the end. we are hoping to have about three children we hoping one will be a girl and the other be a boy it does not matter what the next one would be. I have a Job of looking after the computers so in the morning I get up and go to work then come back at night and do the house work I am so tierd so when I am fineshed I feel like flopping in an arm chair and falling a sleep But injoy my work to much to give it up. I earn about twenty pounds a week. The one thing alot about my Job we have plenty of holidays and so does my husband so we often go to other country we have not long to wait and we are going on holiday to spain for two weeks. Often when I tell people were I have been they always say they which they were me. sometimes when I have over time the I get one of freinds to do my house work for me. And that is what my life at the momant.  Words: 291
