Beening at work is very intresting e*sphaly going to diffrant countryes by plain sometimes when I am over in Spain I bring my pearnts a preasent. But sometimes My father argues with me about diffrant things of others * countryes but mom sayes it is best not to argue with him, he knows nothing about it. When I am in diffrant countryes I colect stamp to put in my book at home. In another three weak time we are going to the U.S.A then we fly from there to New Zealand. At home I read a lot of book and watch Television a lot. The best thing I like doing is helping in the house work. When I am on a Long jounrye I miss My mom & Dad. On the nights when I am at home I usualy go out to night clubs dancing or ice s*ating. When I am in town buying dresses and my mom is with me she always sayes I buy dresses to short then she tell me about the odden days when the dresses are down paste the knees. I keep telling he we are in 1969 not in 1939. I like the job as an airhostes because I like to get about a lot. When i am at home my little sister alway wants me to play with her and take her down the park.  Words: 232
