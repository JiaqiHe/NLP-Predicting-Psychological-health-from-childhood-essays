I live in a flat on my own I sometimes wish I had somebody to keep me company and other times I am glad I am on my own. I enjoy watching television and listening to the radio. I am a school teacher and I am glad I got the qualifications for this job. I enjoy my job and am sometimes glad to get away from all the noise. I am glad when the playtimes come so I can go to the staff room and talk to the other teacher and have a bit of peace. I try at home to think of the best idea's for things I can give the children to do. Somethings the children enjoy and others if they don't pull faces and most likely think have we got to do that. I like to take the children swimming as I like this very much myself. I also like music I can play the guitar, piano and recorder. I like new things for my house such as small things but they add a bightness in the place. My mother and father don't live very far away and they like to read some of the childrens work. There are some children who I have to shout at I don't like doing this but I know its for their own good. I am trying to save up for a car and its just like me to want one that is very expensive. I enjoy letting the children cook and I know they enjoy it to.  Words: 257
