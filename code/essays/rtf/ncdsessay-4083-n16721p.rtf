I am now turned 25 and I am growing up to be a fine overlocker. when I retire I will do odd jobs like washing up, cleaning, dusting, drying and all sorts of other jobs. if very difficult to believe that you are 25. because I will be 26 next year probebly I will die when I am about 50 or 60 I dont know I will probebley live like im a hundred and two if im lucky. When I used to go to work on a monday we used to have more work. on a monday when we had in a week on fridays we used to get paid and on saturdays when we went to work we would probably get about 10% about 10 % of our ordenary work and we would be very pleased with it as well. I would go into the town and so some shopping and buy all new things like a handbag a hat or some sweets probebley I would get something about myself and how I lived. but probebley I'd get somethingmore interesting there I will leave it.
