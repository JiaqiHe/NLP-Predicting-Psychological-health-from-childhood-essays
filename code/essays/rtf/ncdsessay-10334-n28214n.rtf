I would first try to get a house and then I would build a famuily and I would try and make my famaily happy and teach them how to respect oather people. I would not let oather people tell me how to do my buisness. I would like to be a Carpenter and I would go to a club of Wiaght- liftling. I would like my family when they grow up like when I once was twenty five they can help them self and lead a good life. I would take my children to the Zoo Somethimes and to their famaily but outher than that it is for my wife to take them out.  Words: 114
