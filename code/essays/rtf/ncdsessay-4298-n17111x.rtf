If I was twenty five I would live in America in New York and I would work in a office.
Then I would get married and I would leave my job and I would look after my children. On Saturdays I would go horse-riding and I would go on picics with my family. And in the summer we would go to Majorca. We would watch television and when the chidlren were older they would go to school and we would have a dog which I would call Milly because the dog I have now is called Milly. And I would go shopping in New York City and somtimes we would go to parties and we would go swimming. On Sundays we would go to Church. Sometimes we would go to parks for a walk. If I had two girls and two boys I would name them, [female name], [female name], [male name], [male name].  Words: 153
