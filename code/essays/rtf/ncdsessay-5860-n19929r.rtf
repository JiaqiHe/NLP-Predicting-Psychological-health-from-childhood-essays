I would like to be a profesinal cricketer I now play for a cricket team in London and I am working as a bank manager my home life is not very exiting because I am always playing cricket. But when I am at home I am studing bills cheques and orders. I play cricket for a leading London cricket club called the London terriers we play at wembley way. We have just won a cup and all the team are celibrating. The week before we won another cup and a cheque for 100 pounds and gave 50 pounds to charity. I have two children called [male name] and [male name]. They are 11 years and 12 years old. My wife is called [female name] and we lived in Doncaster before we came to London. She workes in a shop in carnaby street. [male] goes to wheatmaster Junior school. Inside our house is a picture of all our football teams like Everton and Chelse and Queens park Rangers. Yesterday we started talking about where we were going for our summer holidays and I sugested Majorca. My wife is interrested in making dresses and making patterns and also for making new clothes for the shop in carnaby street. There is a new T.V. programe just started called Davie and his people. In which a boy called Davie gets involved in a murder. When we finaly decided to go to majorca we took the boys with us and when we came home we were very very sunburnt. When we came to london we were very happy and even today we are still happy.  Words: 270
