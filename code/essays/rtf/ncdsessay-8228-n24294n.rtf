----------------------
I live in a house near the river, with my husband. Every morning I go to work in [town], my daughter (who is 2) goes to her nanny while I'm at work. After, when I come home, my husband has come back from his job and has made me a cup of tea. Usually I either knitt, or watch t.v. in the eveing, but sometimes, (when our daughter is alsleep), we go to a cinema. If the pub is open, after the film is over, we go and have a drink. I work in a factory, making radios for the people who want them. My sister is 46 and has 4 children so my husband and I go to see them, and sometimes stay to tea. When we get home I wash-up and do the ironing, while my husband digs the garden. In Summer the whole family either goes on a picnic or has a swim in the river. On Mondays I do the weekly washing and sewing. At about 1'o clock we have our dinner, after which I wash-up the dirty dishes. The  Words: 184
