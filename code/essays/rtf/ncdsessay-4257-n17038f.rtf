I am now a Bachelar. My job is a carpenter. When I started I got 9 pounds wages. And now I get twenty three pounds. I work verry hard for my mother. I give my mother 14 pound's. And now my mother gets four pound's penshion. So that make's 18 pound's. Because if I wa not a bachelar I would have to keep changing the nappies for the baby. Now my mother buy's me clothes instead of my-self buying them. Today I am gowing fishing in [place name?]. I catch Pike, Roach, Bible, Pearch, and other kind's of fish. I will go on a holiday, with my mother. I have sunday off. I don't like fish and chips. But there is two things I like. They are patty and peas. When I was smaller I didn't feel very big but now I feel like a giant. Now today it is my birthday I feel as good as gold. I have got two pound off my mother and, a pair of long trouses. And we are gouing on a holiday to [town]. It takes about two hours. to get there my mother is enjoying herself like I am. Befor we came we took some packing-up. When I was smaller I went with my brothers and sisters. I felt like faling- to sleep. Now we are on our way back again.  Words: 229
