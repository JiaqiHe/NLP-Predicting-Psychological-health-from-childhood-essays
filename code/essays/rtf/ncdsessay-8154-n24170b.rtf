When I am twentey five I shall be married and I shall have one son. I hope to be a profeshiel swimmer and win medals I all readey can swim 800 and 80 yards* which is 36 lenths. I hope to swim a mile when I get to secondry shcool. For my holbey I shall play golf on Sundays. When my son gets older I shall teach him to swim and be a profeshiell like me, and swimming will pass through the families. I hope that my son will have some children and teach them to swim like I did to him. I hope I shall be the best wimmer in the world. I will try to keep the championship for swimming for a long time then I hope that my son will take it from me and he will win it.  Words: 142
