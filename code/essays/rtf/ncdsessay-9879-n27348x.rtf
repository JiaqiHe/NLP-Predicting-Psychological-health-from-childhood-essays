By the age of 25 I hope to be married and settled down in a bungalow. Also at the age of 25 I hope to be an engineer at [town] Steelworks. My first immpresoions of my job was to go right up on the management side of the steelworks but my father who is a foreman told me that it would take a long time to get to the management side. The bungalow which I hope to live in I would it to be in the country but not two far away from a town for I would have to get groceries also for if we have another bad winter.  Words: 110
