Every day I get up and go to my class at college. This class is in general catering. When I get home about lunch time (because I have only got half days at college now), I make my own dinner. Then in the afternoon I go out and work in a small restaurant until five o'clockish. About once a week I go for an evening class for silver service waiting. In a week I am finishing these evening classes and college. When I have finnished these things I am hoping to get a full time job as a waitress. I am really only intrested about my work but I still have a few hobbies. A few of my hobbies are reading, sewing, and writing. Every week I go horse riding and I aslo enter a few gymkahnas on a horse of one of my freinds. In my evenings I sometimes go out with my freinds from college. We go to the cinema about once every fortnight or so. Every month* I go to a dance somewhere. I live by myself in a small flat near a shopping centre. All the money I spend I earn myself, so I can not afford to have to many luxyries such as parties, new clothes (not to many) and fancy food.  Words: 217
