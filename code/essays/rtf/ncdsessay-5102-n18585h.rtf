...dad a cup of tea for my dad and told my dad all that had happened at work that day and then went to bed but before I went to bed I set  the clock for 6 o, clock so that I would be able to get up to make my fathers breakfast the following morning. The next day I got up and went to make me and my fathers breakfast. I had my breakfast and went to get my father up for work because he had to be at work for 7.30 and I had to be for 8 o, clock. When I got to work the manger wanted to see about [name] I told him what I knew about her and then asked why was he asking me all these qustions and he told me that [name] had killed her self be taking a over doze of tablets that night before. Then the manger told me that I was to go up stairs to help [name] in the cafee because it was getting packed and [name] and [name] needed more help with the customers. All this had come to as a shock about [name] killing herself. I was going home when all of a sudden I stopped I could hear someone calling me so I went to have a look who was calling me I found it was [name] and [name] and they asked me if* I was going out that* night.
