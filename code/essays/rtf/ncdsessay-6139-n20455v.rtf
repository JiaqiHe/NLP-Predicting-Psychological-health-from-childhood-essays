My work is a teacher and I enjoy teaching the children history and Geography. I think teaching is the best job anyone could have, because you have lots of holidays and you could learn something that you have never learnt before. You get paid well and you don't get bored teaching the children. My intrest is going* out every other evening to play tennis with the rest of my friends while my husband would go to play golf with his friends. On Saturday evenings only* I would go to a club and play cards and bingo. When it is 9 o clock and the bell goes all my class would go into the hall, after morning service in the hall the first lessons I would talk about would be Scripture and Maths. Then after we have done that we would have history and english. Every Monday and Thursday we would have P.E. in the yard, we would do some exercise then we would do group work then to end it we would all have a game together. On Thursday morning we would have art and model-making. At weekends I would dig my garden and plant flowers and vegetables ready for the spring. We would have lots of things up on the wall like art and written work. In the evenings I would stay behind after school for about an hour and mark all the children's work that they had done that day.  Words: 242
