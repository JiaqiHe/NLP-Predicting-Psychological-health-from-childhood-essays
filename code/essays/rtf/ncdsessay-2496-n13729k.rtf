I'l get a job as a policeman or try to if I can't i'l try and get in the army cadets if I cannot get job in the army il get one in a shop. I might marry at the age of 28 but I doubt if I will because I dont like going to church and listening to a speech that lasts about 15 minuates. I get bored unless its interesting. My interests will be one of my fathers which is gardening and **stering. I supose if Im not married il have to get a little bunglow and furnish it do the housework etc.... my work at the age of 25 will be hard if I join the police force espechaly trying to track down crimanules and burglers and other stuped people like drunks from a public bar or special. duty during night or patroting in a panda car if someones ill. I'l retire somtime if Im still alive about the age fo 50-55 and get a park-time job things like a cinama countess or a cook in a Hotel or restaurant or even a t.v. studio.  Words: 188
