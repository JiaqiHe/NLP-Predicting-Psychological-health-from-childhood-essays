When I am 25 I hope to have a job. I would like to be a pilot or even an astronaut if it comes to that. I am at home ready for a space flight. I am thinking what sort of trip it is going to be. Is it going to go all all right or is it going to be a disaster. My head is full of the things and I can hardly concentrate on what I am supposed to be doing.  Words: 83
