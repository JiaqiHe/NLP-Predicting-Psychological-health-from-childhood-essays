I am twenty five years old, I am married and I have two children. I live in a city called Bradford, my children are twins and there ages are both six months old. I do not work but I am soon hoping to work. My next door neighboure will look after my children for me. My husband works on the Trollie Buses, he cleans them up in the night. He is called a night shunter. He works at [village] Bus Shed. I myself am hoping to find a job in a store called, Marks and Spencers. If I can not get a job in Marks and Spencers I should like one in a dress shop somewhere in Bradford. I don't want a job anywhere out of Bradford. I want a job 9 until 4-30. My parents are both dead now but my husband's parents arn't. I have one sister who I still fight with. My husband has three sisters and one brother. They are all younger than him and my sister is younger than me. I have just got a job in Marks and Spencers and I work on the Hat stall. The job that I am on I don't like so I am going to work in an office.  Words: 210
