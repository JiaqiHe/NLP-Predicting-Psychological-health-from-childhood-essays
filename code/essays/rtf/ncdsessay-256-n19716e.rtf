I have two children one 4 the other 6. I am working in a school as a teacher. My husband is an Estate Agent. In the evenings we have tea and each person tells the rest about any interesting avents which has happened to them. Then we have a sit and talk about what we are going to buy or if we are going to buy a house or not. We then watch Calendar and the news. At half past seven the children will have a bath and be put to bed. Meanwhile my husband will be seeing that the car's engine is all right so that we shall not be stranded any where is something goes wrong. After that I shall do the ironing or washing or any other jobs that want doing. At Eleven oclock we shall go to bed and get up at seven oclock. At eight oclock I would take the children one to school with me the other to her granma's. My husband goes to work at nine o'clock. At school I [illegible] teach first English, Maths and Art. In the afternoon P.E., Projects and History. On Sundays in the summer we will go to the sea for a day or go visiting. In winter I [illegible] stay at home and watch television or bake. Every Thursday we go to my mother's or mother in law's. At home I do all the housework at night after tea. When I am twenty nine I shall go to another school or stop being a teacher.  Words: 258
