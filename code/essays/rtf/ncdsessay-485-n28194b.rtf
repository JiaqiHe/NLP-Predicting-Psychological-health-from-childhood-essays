I go to work as a Ballet teacher and in a childrens nursery. I am married and live in a pretty cotage called rose villa. I have a small dog called Tinker which gets a lot of fuss. I like to make garden have a lot of colour in it. Inside my cotage Thier is an antique walking stick. It has a dogs head carved on the top. I am expecting babies soon. I hope they are twins and that one is a girl and the other is a boy, If I have a girl I will let her have very long hair so that she can sit on it. My husband is a electricail engerner. After a while when my children are about three I will move into a semi detaced.  Words: 132
