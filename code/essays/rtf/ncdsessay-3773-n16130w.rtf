"My name is [name] and I am twenty five years old. I work as a carpenter and I like it very much the reason is, if I had the wood at home I can make anything I like. 
      Ding! Dong! the bells gone now I've got to go home for tea. I am not married yet but I hope to get married when I am twenty eight. My mother takes very good care of me and she says ""When you get married I hope you get a nice handsome girl"". 
My main hobby is football because I like it very much my football team is called [football club]. We are playing tonight against the [football club] we hope to win but they are at the top of /league/ first division and we are at the bottom.
      Although Im not married I have a girl-friend and her name is [name] my father said ""she's me very nice"". I hope she will come up to see me play because it will make me play very well. 
I do not smoke because my father said it is very bad for me he says this beacuse once he had cancer. He was very bad indeed he was in bed for two weeks and when he got up he was very week indeed. I used to do the work my father done. I better not tell you any more because you most probbely fed up now. well I've got to pack my football kit now because I've got to play football. Do you know what I am yes Im centre-forward*. 
      Good-bye I've got to call for * [name], [name] and [name] because they are on my side too."  Words: 285
