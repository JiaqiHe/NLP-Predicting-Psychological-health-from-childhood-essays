I have been twenty-five for about three months and I am married. I have ben working for four weeks and I enjoy it. The work which I do is teaching lessons on music, the instruments which I teach on is the piano, violin, guitar and the viola.
My husband name is Mr. [surname] and mine is Mrs. [surname].
The house we live in is a bunglo near the sea there is about another twelve houses near by. Most of the time I am teaching but in my spare time I have to do housework.
I live a very straight forward and I do not wear posh clothes.
I have been married for about one and a half year, and soon I will be getting a baby. At the moment I can not do very much teaching because of the baby. 
Half a year or so passes and I've had the baby, we have named her sembra. When she grows up I'm thinking and hoping she also will become a teacher on music or go to concerts and perform there.
