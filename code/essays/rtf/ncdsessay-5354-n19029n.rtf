We were to go on 13th July to her house the day came when it was time to go I picked my bags up My brother's were not going because they went to see a football match and were more intrested about that than going to my grandma's for to stay with her. I got on to the train and put my things in the luggage comparment the train started to go and I sat down knowing it was only one hundred and eighty miles the man came for the ticket's, I gave him my ticket and he said wait a minite lady your next' all right I whispered under my breath.
