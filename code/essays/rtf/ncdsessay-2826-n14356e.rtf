I am 25 years old and I have just got a job on the *ut it is alright but you have to get at the place at the right time. I get home at 12 o'clock sometimes but it is nice to drive a big coach load of people to the sea side. At home I do alots of things like play at cards with friend I lose alot of money but it is not bad. But I might play darts with my father. We have our breakfast about nine o'clock and dinner at one o'clock and then go to work. I may take a load of people to [reservoir] or [village] I would take my tea with me and a bottle os shandy that was one day over. I might go out in my fathers car till it is time for work or go to town for my dinner and park the car in the car park at front Woolworths it would cost some thing about 1/3 to 2/=. I might just by a few things for my mother a few potatos a lb of apples and sometimes run her in to town it would be fun. it might be a very good job not bad wage to they tell me. I would take a bag of sandwiches and take something to drink sometimes the club that I take calls in at Lincolns grand hotel it would be fun woudent it.  Words: 242
