"I am a Doctor in the (hospital) Hospital. Every day i go round the patients to see if they are all right. I start work at 9 . 0 am. and finish at 7-30pm. When I come home I have my tea and then go to the pictures or sometimes I just stay at home and watch the television . Other nights I go to see friends . I get up at 7-30am and go to bed at 10-30p.m. Next year I am being moved to a hospital in (place). I have 30 patients two of which are children . The children both have just had their tonsils out .
On a Thursday night I go out to see friends and on a Friday i go to the pictures . I have a boyfriend and I go out every Saturday with him.
When I come home on a Saturday I usually help a lot in the house. I have one brother and one sister. My hobbies are doing first aid . I usually go out on a Monday and teach it at a night class.
My boyfriend is also a doctor at a Hospital in (place).
During the whole year I get 22 days holiday . although I enjoy ""my holidays I always look forward to go back to work. I am very happy with my career."  Words: 223
