I have left University and have joined the R.A.F. I have a wife and 2 children and I playu for The R.A.D. football and cricket team. Last season our football team was in the final between another R.A.F. team and we beat them five nill. I scored a hat trick. 
being a pilot for the R.A.F. is a good life. The pay is good as well as the food. and there is always a chance of exitment up in the clouds. I am training hard so I can fly a gnat* in the Red Arrows formation. At the moment I am flying an arrow vulcan on patrol duty.
When I'me at home I usualy treat the wife and our boy to a day trip some where. last lear we went to black pool fair where I saw one of my friends. Next day I do odd jobs around the house and at night help our boy with his homework and when he's in bed I tell his thrilling bedtime stories about the R.A.F. Then When he's asleep I go out to the snooker club with our neighbours. I won ten shillins off them last time becase he said I couldn't pot more than one ball a shot. I poted three. Then I just laze around till its time to go back to work.
We have a cricket match in five minutes SO I will have to stop remenising. It is the final and funely enough, its with the same team the we beat in the final of the football cup.
At the end of match I had scored a century and had taken four wikts for nothing.  Words: 274
