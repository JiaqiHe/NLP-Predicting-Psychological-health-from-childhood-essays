I am now twenty five years old. When I was at college I took up the study of natural history. I have been interested in nature since I was a little boy. My life is a very normal one We are not rich and we are not poor. There are six people in my family and I am not married. I am especially interested in the prehistoric creatures that once were roaming the earth. I get on well with my family and I am living in my mother and fathers house and always will be because I am never going to get married. I can still rememeber when I used to go on nature walks when I was only eleven. I have got my own study with a lot of books and charts about nature.  Words: 135
