I am now 25 Years old. I have a job as an electrician in the army and I like it very much. In this job I see very important people who protect the country. On my leave I go on holiday and make the most of it while I have no work to do. During my working hours I have to work hard to keep radio's, planes ect. working. I took up this trade so that when I left the army I could go straight on to another job having to learn a trade. This is a very interesting job and I can fix any electric things in my house without calling any electrician to do it for me. Just now I'm interested in planes and how they fly.  Words: 129
