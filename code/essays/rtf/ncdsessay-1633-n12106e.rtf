I am not married and I will not marry until I have a deposit on a house, a secure job, and some money in the bank. My interests are reading, watching and playing football, swimming, and driving and working my car. I get up about eight o clock in the morning and go down to the doctor's office and get ready for my patients Some nights I am called out and have get out of bed to go to where I am needed. I ame helped by three other doctors and we take shares of all the calls, rounds, and we are ready to cope with anything that turns up. We all have cars because sometimes we have to take people to hospital in our cars. I like driving and I going change my car every two years as it is doing a lot of running around in two years  Words: 193
