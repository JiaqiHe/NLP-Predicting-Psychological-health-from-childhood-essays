I am leading a very interesting life teaching a class of infants. Some of these children are clever whereas some are no so We. I give them two or three small sums a day as well as drawing pictures and working from cards. At home I help my mum with the house work and make my own clothes. I have two horses that I ride every day and in my spare time at weekends I enter them for various shows I have another hobby which is swimming which I enjoy doing very much. At the school where I am working the other teachers are very nice and friendly. Before I started teaching attended colledge. I liked it there and had many freinds which have now gone to different schools to teach. Some times we go out together for a meal. At night I spend most of my time marking the backs and papers that belong to the children. The rest of my time I spend with my horses. and helping my mum.  Words: 172
