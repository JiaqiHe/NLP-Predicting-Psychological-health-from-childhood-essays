----------------------
My name is (name) I left University at the age of 21. I was aiming to be at teacher. I studied history, english mathematics and I took a degree. I passed and was told that I had qualified for a teacher. When I left I got married. I was 22. I was a teacher in (place) where my husband was headmaster. We had a son two years ago. His name is (name). I teach a class of 45. Some of them are quite inteligent, but other's find it hard to catch on. Out of school I enjoy cooking, dancing, and if I can find the time reading. I teach netball at school and most of the girls enjoy it. But some are sulky and dont play. We are doing a tournament at the moment, and all the girls are trying hard. When I was a little girl I used to dream about being on the stage, but of course little girls dreams dont always come true. My husband is a marvellous cook. Being a man this odd, but he`s had a lot of praise for his cooking. He enjoys judo and fencing. (name) goes to nursery school, because as (name) (thats my hus-band) parents are dead and mine are in Switzerland there is no-one to look after him. Well I hope you've enjoyed hearing about me and about my work and family. I'd like to hear about yours some day. I hope its possible.
Goodbye.  Words: 244
