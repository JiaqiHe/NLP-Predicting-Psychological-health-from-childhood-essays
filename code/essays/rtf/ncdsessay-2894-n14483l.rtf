I am 25 years old and I have joined the Navy. The ship I am in is the H.M.S. Mitilda and it is a battle ship. I have to scrub the deck every day. We have to sleep under the deck in hammocks. When we get up in the morning we get dressed and have breakfast. After breakfast we have to scrub the deck again. On low* boat* it has 6 guns and 4 rowing boats. There is a man who put us on course if we are lost. And when we come back from the sea we go home.  Words: 100
