When I am twenty-five I hope I shall be an arkeologist and that I will soon digging up some Ancient remains of something that was built (or alive many yearsago.
I also may be an international swimmer . I hope I will be married with three children. I would take my children to the baths quite often.
I hope that I will be living in the country.
I hope to find some old remains of prehistoric reptiles .  Words: 75
