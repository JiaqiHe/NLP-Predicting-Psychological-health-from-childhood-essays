I am 25 and I left Collage four years ago, I teach at [name of school] Junior School and I teach Junior 3. I like my work and I like the people I work with. I have one child at the age of two, when she is about three four or five she will go to dancing class. I do not own my own dancing class but work Saturdays mornings at one, we teach tap dancing and ballet dancing. I am intrested in dancing and I hope my child will be. I hope she will pass some exams and get certificates. I have my own house with a big garden. I am leading a happy life and enjoy everything in it. While I am at school my little girl go's to [name of nursery] Nursery and she enjoys it but she always likes coming home. I have a car of my own and can drive it I passed my test first time. My main intrests are dancing, knitting but sewing I hardly ever do because I don't get the time. At school I like teaching history and Maths. I have a needlework and knitting club on Wednesday lunch times for girls that are intrested.  Words: 204
