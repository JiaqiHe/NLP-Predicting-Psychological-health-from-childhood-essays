My life is tough, and in my spare time I go fishing, and play rugby each Saturday afternoon. At home I get on very well, I am not married and I get two thousand pounds a year. I have over one hundred people employed and they make motor cars and fix engines, and I am a engineer. I have been interested in radio's and woodwork. My games are Football, Tenis, and Table Tenis. I like reading in the night, I am a very good swimmer. My men that work for me are making a new car which as only now started so we cannot tell, the men get twenty five pounds a week.  Words: 113
