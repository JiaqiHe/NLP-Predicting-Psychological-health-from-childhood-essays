The life which I am leading is quiet common I am a marine at Portsmouth. I live in the brarots (sleeping quarters 12, which is the best quarters in the barots.) When I have leave I can go and see my mother and father and take my corpe to. When I am at the barats I receive letters from my mother and father and we deside where we are going on holiday and when I can get leave from it and how long we are going for. When we are not on dute we can have games and we can go out of the barats and if you are not on time from breakfast dinner or supper you may lose some of it or get no food at all Each morning at 7 am we get up and be on prade by 8 am. After that we have to do training and as I am aengineer I have to keep up to scratch we how to get things which have to be put together such as a brige. over a river.  Words: 181
