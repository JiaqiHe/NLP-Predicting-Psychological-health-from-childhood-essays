----------------------
I play for a profesinal Rugby league club their name is [town] Northern. 
I have a very nice home in [town]. It is a semi detached house with all modern applieances and has three bedrooms.
I have been married now for about three years. I enjoy coming home to my wife and kid. My main intrests are collecting stamps and looking after my garden. I lead a very good home life I set off for work at ten o'clock and return at 7,o'clock unless i'm playing Rugby my other job is a P.T. coach at a local school. A lot of my life goes to my family every SUnday we go for a drive in the car. Sometimes we go to the lake district for two or three days at a time.
When the season restarts I don't spend a lot of time at home, well really I dont have the time we are either training or playing Rugby or sometimes we go on tour. My life has been affected since I started playing Rugby, my whole life has altered I feel different I get a lot of money and I have a family who depend on me and I have a wife. I feel realaxed when I am at home, I alter when I am at work I feel as if I have the urge to do well and go far in life and please my wife and make her proud of me. I want also the public proud of me. But most of all I want twenty five to be the begining.  Words: 262
