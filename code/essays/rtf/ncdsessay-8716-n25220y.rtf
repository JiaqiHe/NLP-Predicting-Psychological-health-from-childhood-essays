When I am 25 I'd like to have children and have a nice home for them. I would have a dog for us all. I would books to read and I would have a part time job working in a shop when they were older enough for me to leave them. When they were old enough to play in the garden I would have a shed for them to play in. They would have a swing and slide.  Words: 78
