I'm not quite sure really. But I might be a scientist, I'm thinking of at the moment. I would be a scientist of astromony because at the moment. I'm very interested in astromony, if I have failed the 11 plus scholarship exam, I don't know what I would be. I'll be a astromoner if I pass the 11 scholarship exam and go to grammar school. 
     My hobbies would be stamp collecting, coin collection and a few other hobbies. 
     I'm might be going to live in U.S.A. and live there the rest of my life, I could be living in Texas or Florida and keep my life on rockets aswell as planets and stary. every time a rocket with astronouts in it, I might contact them by having a large radio station like Houston space centre but smaller and could contact satelites with live television pictures off spacecraft what there doing testing the journey to get there and back to earth. 
     As well I can be a firm manager of capsule legs for re-entering and to land on land much easier.  Words: 183
