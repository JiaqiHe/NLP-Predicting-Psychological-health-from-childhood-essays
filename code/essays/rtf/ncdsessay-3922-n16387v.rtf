When I am at the age of 25 I think I would like to join the Paycore with the army. I would like to reach a brigerdar* in it. I should hope to live in Germany becaues I live thier now and I like it. In my holdays in the winter I would go skiing somtimes*. I think the work might be quite nice as well as quite hard but I think I might like it thier. I think I might get up quite* early* about qauter two eight. during the day I would do most of the work thier and bring some work back to do at the house. I might have a dog as a pet I think I will live in a army house near some small hills and a wood. In the summer I will play crickey with the army and go swimming. Take my dog for walks in the wood. I hope to have quite a big garden with a apple and cherry tree in it I would have some strawberry plants My dog would be an asiation.  Words: 183
