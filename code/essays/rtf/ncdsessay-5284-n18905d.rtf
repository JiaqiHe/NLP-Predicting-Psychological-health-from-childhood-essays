I am now 25 and married I have a baby son and a morning job, at a shop which my husband owns. Our help looks after [male name] my son while I am at work. when I have finished the work at the shop I go shopping for things I need. I get home from shopping at twelve o'clock, and begin to cook the lunch. I am not a very experienced cook yet so sometimes I have to look up in a cookery book. After lunch I usually take [male name] out to the part in his chair before he goes to sleep, the is only just round the courner of the street so it only takes a few minutes to get there. At the park I let him have a run and we sometimes bring along his ball so we sometimes play throwing the ball to each other. We spend about half an hour at the park and we go home so that [male name] can have a short nap. While he has his nap I go round the house tidying up the which our help did not. I practicaly do the same things during the day that I have done today.  Words: 203
