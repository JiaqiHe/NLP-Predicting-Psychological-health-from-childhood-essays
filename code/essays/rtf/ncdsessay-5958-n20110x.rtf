I am married with two children my husbands name is [male name], he is a woodworker. My children are at school and I have lots of things to do in the house. Often at night I am worn out with looking after the house. My husband is leading a hard life like me he works long hours every week. My life is easier than [male name]'s but we have quite a big house and it takes a lot to keep it clean. Later in the year we moved to a smaller house and I was able to take a job as an assistant in a big supermarket the work isn't too hard and I can still find time to work at things that interest me. I like to do a bit of gardening now and then most of all I like to play the piano I have got a few certificates for it so I can entertain people by playing when they come. I have still got my job and I like it, the manger is very nice but soon I shall have to stop work for I will be having another baby. [male name] is still a woodworker but he doed not have such long hours and he gets good pay in this area. My children [male name] and [female name] are five they go to a public school and they get on very well in most subjects. [female name] takes after me she likes to play about on the piano and make tunes up on her own [male name], the little boy likes to make mud pies in the dirt but I am very happy and I like my home and every thing in it.
