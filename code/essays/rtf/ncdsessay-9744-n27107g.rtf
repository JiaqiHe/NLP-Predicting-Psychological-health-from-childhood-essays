Now I am twenty five years old and I am studying very hard to be a doctor at a university near London. Already I am a quallified swimming instructress and give lessons to schools every Thursday. Also in my spare time I do gymnasts at the university. The university is just for girls but boys are allowed in all day on monday. I am 5ft 7ins tall. My hair is shoulder length and I wear spectacles. My parents live at [town] and each week I send money home to them which I earn on a Saturday by helping at a hospital. I plan to keep studying hard until I am a qualified doctor and then get married. I would like to have some children of my own. Then I plan to come home and live and work at [town].  Words: 139
