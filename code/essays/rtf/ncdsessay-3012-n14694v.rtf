I am 25 years of age and I am a part time nanny because I am married and I have two children of my own one boy and one girl. It is very hard to be a nanny when you are married and have children of your own but I manage. To be a nanny you have to have a lot of years practise going to places to learn about it and when I had finished my training and went in for a test and I passed I was very happy because I have little children. Sometimes it is lovely with the children but sometimes it is terrible because they scream. The children have all different kinds of natures some are very nice but others are nasty. The ages of the children I look after are from being a little baby up to five years of age. I get very well paid and I get quite a few holidays too. There are quite a few other nanny's that I work with too they are very nice. When you are a nanny you get changed to different places and so you get alot of friends. but sometimes you get so attached to one place that you don't want to leave. When you are really good enough you might yet picket to look after an important person's children but most times the children are spoilt and nasty so it is not a pleasure to look after them. I am not quite good enough yet but I am quite near to it.  Words: 259
