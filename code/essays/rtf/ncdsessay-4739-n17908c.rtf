I WOULD LIKE TO DRIVE A CAR WHEN I AM 25 AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE A MOTOR MECANIC IN A GARAGE. IN THE HOUSE I WOULD MAKE THINGS OUT OF WOOD LIKE BOOKRAKS, WOODEN FLOWER  BEDS, AND A TOOL BOX TO KEEP MY TOOLS IN. I WOULD WORK IN THE GARDEN SOME DAYS* AFTER WORK I MIGHT GO OUT SOMETIMES WITH MY MOTHER AND FATHER, I DONT THINK I WILL SMOKE* BECASE YOU COULD GET CANCER AND BE VERY ILL OR DIE. I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY FOOTBALL IN MY DINNER BREAK WITH OTHER MEN FROM PLACES* NEARBY THE GARAGE. I DONT THINK I WILL GET ENGAGED NOT AT 25 ANYWAY*. MY CAR WILL BE A Px FAST CAR LIKE A SPORTS CAR. OR A LONG FAST ONE.  Words: 130
