I now work in a shop called [xxxxxxx] in [xxxxxxx]. In the shop we sell sweets, biscuits cigerettes and pop etc: Well one day when I was working in the back garden and the shop was shut, I noticed that we needed a new fence and some bright flowers, so I went to get some new flowers at some fencing. As I am quite good at handicrafts I soon built up the fence. On Saturday afternoons I go to the football match to see Chelsea o Manchester United as I now live in Chelsea. I am also in a choir, singing tenor or alto. In the shop on Mondays I get at least fifty orders for some groceries and confectionary, and for about an hour [illegible section] at giving them to [illegible section] altogether in [illegible section] out of that I have to give [illegible section] monthly which is 5 extra a month. Out of this money I keep £5 [illegible section] and about £10 for stuff for [illegible section] in the trustee savings bank. When my wife goes over the shop in the afternoon I have a part time job at the football Ground [illegible section] cleaning players boots. I sometimes when [illegible] get [illegible] autographs for my son Stephen. At night when I get home from the Ground I usually have a bottle of pop (or beer) and one or two cigarette from in the shop. At about half-past ten or eleven o'clock at night I go to bed. Our house has three bedrooms, one for me and my wife, one for Stephen and one spare room.  Words: 269
