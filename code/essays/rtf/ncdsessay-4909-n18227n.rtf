My job is a school teacher, I teach the seniors. The school I teach in is called [school name] Secondary School. It is a very interesting job. I teach French and Latin. I am not married because I believe it is a hinder to my job. Every day at three p.m. I leave the school in which I work, and go to the baths. I am not boasting but I a very good swimmer. Nearly every fortnight I enter swimming contestsm and win each one. Then at five-thirty p.m. I go back to the school to take a homework class, which lasts usually for an hour or so. When it is round-about eight o'clock, I correct the French and Latin homework the children have done, at least tried to have done. On a Saturday morning I go riding with a friend of mine. I am not good at riding, and I need the hat, for without that I would certainly have head injuries. On Sunday I go to church for two hours, then go out with my friend. Then it's back to school on Monday morning. Monday seems to be the worst day at school, everyone is so grumpy because of the five school days to go. Of course, I am the most cheerful one of them all. I stay at school until it is four o'clock this time, because I do not take homework classes at five-thirty. So I do not give the class homework.  Words: 246
