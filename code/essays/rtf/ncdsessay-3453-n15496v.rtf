I am interested in aircraft and space. I would like to go to America and Cape Kennady. I like drawing and painting animals, aircraft and ships. At home we have two dogs and a cat. Every morning before I go to work I give the children a lift to school. I am the pilot of a VC10 aircraft. My car is a Ford Capria and is scarlet in coluor. The house is white with blue window silles and edges with a glass front door. I help my son make models which cost more than ten shillings. The dogs play with the cat. I hope to save ten thousand pounds to by my own aircraft  Words: 114
