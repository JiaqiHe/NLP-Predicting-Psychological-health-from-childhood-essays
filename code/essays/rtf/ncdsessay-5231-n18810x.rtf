Now I am 25 years old I drive a lorry and I play football for a football club. At the weekends I go to football matches and go shopping. The shops are not very far for me to go in my car. Some times I watch my television. I am going to get married in September. I left school when I was fifteen years old. I like working better than school.  Words: 71
