I am trying to become a Architect so I go to university most of the day. When I come home I firstly do my home work. I like desighning my own modles and painting I like to do some gardening and things of that nature. My best athletic field is swimming and I like it best. I live on the outskirts of London. I have no real wish to get married but stay single If I don't pass I would like to stay with engineering and Desighning. I like to spend money ecenomiklly and get bills etc... payed as soon as they come sailing through the door. I would like to have some pets but I could not keep them. For Holidays I prefer hot countries and I like flying and taking risks.  Words: 133
