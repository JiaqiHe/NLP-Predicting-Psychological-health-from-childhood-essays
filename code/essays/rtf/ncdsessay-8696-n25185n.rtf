I've been learning to be a piolet at Collage we all have to wait 2 years before we can fly in a plane. I took my piolet exam and I passed. I was then sent to a flying school to learn to fly a jet areoplane. I soon was able to fly a Jumbo Jet 747. The pay for being a piolet was good and I was enjoying this job of flying all over the world. I went to Manchester to see about a house for me to live in, I saw a bungalow on a hill which I thought would do nicely for myself to live in. I looked at the price it was resnerble. I bought it, and bought all the furniture for the bungalow. I am leading a happy life living on my own but its a bit of a problem cooking, and washing ing clothes. In the day time I fly to other countries but at night I just stroll around the placies where I live. I walking into the [pub] and had a drink a girl came in and I offered her a drink she took it. I asked her her name she said [name] she asked me my name I said [name], we soon got to know each other very well after a bought 2 months I asked her to marry me she said Yes. We have know a child and are leading a very happy life. I have a larger house which has a swimming pool at the back of the house.  Words: 259
