I would get up at 6.30 to wake my husband up to go to work. Then when it was 7 00 clock I would get my child up who would be about 3. I would get washed and dressed and make the breakfast. When my husband had gone to work I would let my child go out to play if it was nice. When it had gone out I would sit down and do some knitting or sowing. Then I would put the hover round and do the dusitng and wash up the breakfast things. After that I would make the beds.
At about 11.00 I would start to cook the dinner. When it was done I would call my child in and make it wash it's hands and sit down to dinner. At half past one I'd turn on the T.V. for my child to see watch with mother while I washed up the dinner things.
My interests would be knitting for my children and Jumpers for my husband and cooking. When my husband got home I would give him a dinner and we would have a tea.
I would put my children to bed at 6.30 (the 3 year old that is.) And then I would go to the W.I or cooking lessons and leave my husband to took after the children.  Words: 221
