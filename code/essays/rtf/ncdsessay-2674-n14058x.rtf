I am Miss K [surname] and I live in a flat in London with a friend of mine who is called Miss B. [surname]. I am a designer and I design womens clothes and hats. [female name] works in a dress shop which is just across the road from our flat. Almost every night we go out with our boy friends but sometimes our Mothers or Father come to visit us and then we go out with them. 
I get up at about 7.30 to make our breakfast and when it is ready I wake [female name] up. she usually grumbles and say's that its too early for her to get up, but I don't take any notice of her. For my dinner I go to a restarant and I sometimes meet my boy friend [male name] [surname]. After I have had my dinner I go striaght back to work. I think the best dress I designed was Evening Rose, which was a long tred* gown with a lovely rose pattern on the front and a lace trimming at the back of the gown. The Hat that went with it was also red but this had yellow flower on it with a large red rose on the top, at the back was a yellow and red ribbon that hung down. The total price of this outfit was xxxx990.
Lord Graystoke bought the dess and hat for Lady Graystoke Of course the dress and hat cost nothing to Lord Graystoke for he is a millionheir.
I enjoy my work and the way I live and there is nothing else I would wish for.  Words: 270
