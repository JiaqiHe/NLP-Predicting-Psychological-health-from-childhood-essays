[name]   110234      I hope that I would be an artist, so that i can paint scenes, and make the sceneary look all kinds of beautiful greens. I would be able to draw farms, scenes, and people, a lot better than what I can already draw. I would be able to draw without making any mistakes. I would be able to do lots of pictures, frame them and send them to shops, I suppose I will get quite a lot of money for all the pictures that I will be painting, and I will enjoy this because of the lots of money I will be earning. I am not as good as an artist yet but in a few years time, I am sure that I will be Artistic.  Words: 128
