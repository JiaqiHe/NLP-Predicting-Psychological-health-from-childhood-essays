I am in gajed, in four weeks I will be maride. I am planing to go to another countre I have plentey of money saved up. The money I saved was from selling my picers. When I am at home by myself I site down and start to draw some drawings. My hobbey is a artist. I started as a artist when I was 17 that was when I left school . but when I dont whont to draw I go into the countreside and just smell the fresh air. But when I am maride I will have to give up my jobe and find a new one. I was thinking to be come a long distant lorrey driver then I would get much more money
