Know I ama vet mty work is quite tough I live in a maesion in Norfolk. My bother* is an aprentice Jockey and my farther works at a dog racing track. I am not married and still live with my mother and fartehr. My hobbys are fishing, hunting and gardening. 
As a very I have to look after peoples animals. mainly cats and dogs. But when I have any spare time I check the helth of my animals. In the evening I go to a school for lerning how to look after farm animals and to protect the cows from foot and mouth deses. I sometimes have to get out of bed at 2 o'clock in the morning to travel to different places such as Birmingham or London.
I have a surgery joining on to my house there I kep al my necercery equipment I sometimes go to the library for books on gardening and vetrinary.
In the week I hardly ever get time to do any hunting but on Sundays when I dont do anything I get plenty of time I mainly hunt foxes and rabbits. Next year when I will be 26 I will go on a tour over England I will then learn about animals bones and all things like that. When I am 39 I will retire and just kepp my hobbies of hunting, fishing and gardening.  Words: 229
