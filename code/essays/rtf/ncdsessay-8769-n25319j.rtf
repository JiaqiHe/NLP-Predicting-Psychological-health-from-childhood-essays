I would get a job in an office and go home to dinner every day. I would like to go out at night times for a meal in a restarraurnt and go to people houses a talk and take my parents out to places. I would like to get a car I would live with my parents. travel to places like London and scotland. And I would have a jolly good time and buy lots of things and have parties.  Words: 80
