I am now 25 years old and I am married. I have no children yet. I have got a job as a secretary in a bank. It is nice being a secretary in a bank because you can go around the hole bank with messages and you meet people every day. you have got a type writter for your self and you have to count money. When I had just started at the job it was hard for me to count the money because I forgot how much total was so I had to count it all over again. When the day's job is done I go home to my home which is a new home because I left my other home where my parents live. I do not drink or smoke and my husband is a manager of a foot ball team.
