I am leading a happy life I have a good job and I have plenty of interests. I will start with my job, my job is a short hand typist and I have to take letters down from forty men who are in this area of the [company] then I have to go to a little room where a type writer is there then I type all the letters down. When I have finished I have to put them in an envelope and take them to the post office. When I have finished that I have to go to the boss and I have to write a letter for him in short - hand and then I take it to the head girl and see if its write, then she puts it in an envelope and she posts it again. My interests are cooking, dancing and going out on a night. First I start with cooking. Cooking is my favourite interest because you can cook many different things. I like dancing because it gives you some where to go on a night insted of just sitting in the house watching television or reading. When I go out on a night I go to a dance or to a club with a boy I have met. Sometimes I go to Party's if I invited by one of my friends. My home is very happy especily my little brother who is always getting into mischief my mother and father are always happy wen if one of us is bieng told of by one of the they are always happy. My brother who is 15 is alway misrible if you say something really happy and everyebodys laughing he'll just sit there. but otherwise every body is always happy.  Words: 295
