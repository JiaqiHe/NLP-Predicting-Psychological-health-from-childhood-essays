I am a school teacher and I teach children of 11 years. It envolves a lot of patiense to be able to teach propally. There are times when I get very cross, but I try to hold my temper. I have 38 children in my class. In the morning I have to get up quite early in order to tidy the house and cook my breakfast. When I come home at night I cook an evening meal and wash up. Before I mark some of my children's work. I am interested in lots of things expesially drawing and painting. I also like having a game of chess now and then. I am leading a nice life. with not much to grumble about. I am very pleased when the weekends and the holiday's come. for I can relax, soon I'm back at school with lots of things to think about and do. At night I am very tired and often I wake up in the morning with such alot on my mind that I get a headache. Being a school teacher is a hard job. When I take the children out for a day somewhere I have got to be on guard all the time. That is worse than looking after a herd of pigs. I try to do my best. I am quite happy with my job for we get paid during the holidays as well as during the week. I like being a school teacher not because of the wages. I think that it is a worth while job.
