My life is a happy one and there are too many things going on in this world for me, that's why its so puzzling. I have not got any children and I live in a country farmhouse with my husband. We lead a life of different things between us for instance we both work on the farm but only when he gets spare time he does it but I do it mostly.
My husbands job is on the dairy factory and earns xxxx19 per week, and with our animals and mile to sell we earn a bit more. 
Each day I have to do my washing ironing and cleaning my house.
My hobbies are to explore things going camping, reading when I get time. etc
I hat doing my house work and spring cleaning, but I have to do it or else I will have an untidy house. We like living in the country because its' quite and peaceful besides we both like working on the farm.
my favourite cow's are silver and goldey. (thats their names.) We have a few geese, hen's and chickens. a lot of sheep, 2 horses and a few pigs.
thats the life I lead at 25.  Words: 197
