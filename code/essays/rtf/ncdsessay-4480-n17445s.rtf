My job now is that I am an architect and I am designing buildings such as houses, flats, shops, ETC. I am married and have three children my hobbies are decorating, gardening, driving and helping in the house.
At home we all help each other and in the summer we often go out. We live in a bungalow near Ipswich. When I come home from a days work I like to have a cooked meal and see the family and I hope to have a dog.
When we go on holiday I would like to take my family abroad alot. I would like my wife to be blond and with nice atitudes.
I will be firm with my children but not strict. The car I have is a nice family car not to big not to small and quite powerful. When my children grow up I hope they have a good education and a good job.
I would support a local football called Ipswich town. I read papers of interest to me and my wife and I watch alot of television.
I don't smoke and I only drink sometimes.  Words: 184
