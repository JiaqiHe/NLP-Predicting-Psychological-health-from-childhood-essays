My job is a pilot for B.O.A.C I fly a VC10 and I enjoy my work very well. I fly all over the world and when I am not working I look around for a fishing place and when I find one I start fishing. Some-times when I can't fish I go swimming. I mostly fly to America and Australia and as soon as I get there I either try and find accomadation or if I can't find it I sleep in the plane. Then in about two days I make the journey back home to England. I mostly land at London airport but when the is bad weather I land a **** airport.  Words: 114
