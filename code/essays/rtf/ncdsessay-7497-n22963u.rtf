I am now 25 and I teach people and children to look after ponies. I have three children myself and they like riding as well. My husband is in the navy and is on leave. I have a child of twelve one of eleven and another of 10. We all have ponies and horses for ourselfs. I have got a lot of money. So we are quite rich when you think about it. One day when we were all cleaning our tack we heard thunder we quikly ran and got all the ponies in the stables before lightened struck and the rain poured down. One of my children almost got struck and was frightened very much by it. One day as we were riding one of the ponies stumbled and my child fell off and hurt herself. She had broke her arm and was unable to ride for a couple of weeks. Then one day my husband came home from on leave but he had to go back again on Friday today was wednesday and my children and went for a ride. Then when he came back next day we all lived happily ever after.  Words: 195
