I have been training to be a doctor. I am working in [country], in a hospital near the capital, [city]. We have lots of patients in our hospital including tourists from England Germany etc. My house is on the coast overlooking the sea. I do not live in an isolated position I have a big garden, and ducks and geese in it, to keep the grass down. At home, I often stroll down to the beach and pick up rare shells and fossils. I go bird watching on the cliffs also I drive into the town where the hospital is, in my car. In the afternoons I do some studying in my office at the hospital. In the hospital we have about three hundred patients to tend to. I do many operations. In my spare time I also enjoy to go riding and fishing. Sometimes I go down to the harbour and buy fresh fish that have just been caught from the trawlers*. My two brothers are living in England with my mother and father, sometimes they come down and spend a Summer holiday with me, and the following Summer I go to England to see them.  Words: 197
