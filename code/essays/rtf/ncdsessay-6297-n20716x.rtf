I am twenty five years old. I would like to be married to a dark handsome man. My aim in life is to be a secretary to a boss in a big firm. If  I had three children and two were girls and one was a boy I would call them [name], [name], and [name]. If I had a chance to emigrate I would like to go to Sweden. If I had the money I would buy a big manor somewhere by the sea. The colour that I would have it painted would be a light yellow and dark red. I think these to colours go together quite nice. I would like also to own a big red sports car. If I could not own a manor I would like to have a farm. On the farm I would have cows, sheep, pigs, horses, fowl and geese. If some of the fields were covered with grass I would let all the sheep, cows and horses on. I would teach my children to ride the horses. Some of the cattle I would sell to cattle markets and also at the same time buy some. At the age of twenty five my interests would be quite alot, such as reading, looking after some sheep and feeding the hens and geese. I think that when you are twenty five you are at a nice age for things. I would like a colour television because in black and white it does not seen very realistic.  Words: 251
