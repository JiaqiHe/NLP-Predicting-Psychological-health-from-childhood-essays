I am now 25 years old now and I have to enjoy life I will start to watch football matches. I am hoping to get married and to have a family. I will buy a car and take my family out on holidays. I will try to get a good job. I will not drink beer or smoke cigarettes I think smoking is a filthy habit. I will buy good things for the home and for the family. I hope that i can join a club of some sort. I hope I can come to visit my parents regularly and visit my brothers, wherever they will be living. I do hope that I can visit some of my old school mates and see how they are getting on. I will now start to make things like clay models, book-cases and bird tables. I have a lot of aunts and uncles that I can visit now and again. I used to enjoy visiting them when I was small Now I am 25 I cannot do things that I could do when I was younger like playing football. I used to like going bird-watching which I still can do now which is good for me I do not know yet what my children will like when they grow up. I like being older because you have better things to do although you cannot do some things. Anyway I enjoy being old in someways  Words: 241
