I am now 25 years old I live in [district] in a very modern tall block of flats built in 1982 before that I lived with my mother and father but now I earn xxxx40 a week I can afford a house of my own. I am an accountant in a big company. I have to add up sums of money and as I used to like arithmatic in school I don't find the job too difficult. I play for a little sunday league football club called [football club] who of course come from [district]. I play at inside right in this team and I really enjoy my sunday football. On some nights I go to watch football matches in [city]. With my wages I give xxxx5 10s to my parents, my rent is xxxx7 and therest is for things like food, electric and clothes and I have to give some of my money to tax. I do not smoke or drink, and I am not married. I do not go to the cinema very often and when I am in bed I have to read to get to sleep because I am restless. After my sunday football I have lunch then I run round the park with my tracksuit on. Last year I took my parents on holiday to the Canary Islands they had a lovely time and so did I. We really got brown as berries. In the next 5 or 10 years I hope to own my own buisness.  Words: 252
