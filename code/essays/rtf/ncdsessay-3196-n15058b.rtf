I work at the same firm as my father. My favourite sports are moter car racing and horse riding. I am married and have one boy. His name is (name). I have recently bought 15 acres of land. I intend to use half for a Go-Kart track and half for my horses. I hope to be an electrical engineer soon. Every year I go to a different countrie for my holiday. This year I am going to Portugal and I hope to stay for 3 weeks My father helps me with any difficulttes I have with my car. I have got a small speed boat which take to (town) some-times. I have my own work shop which I tune and mend my Go-Kart engines in. I have a very good friend who lives at the farm down the lane. He helps me with my horses and lets me leave them with him for the blacksmith to shoe them.  Words: 202
