I am now 25 years old and I am taking a part time job as a student taking Needlework. On Saturdays I go to a dressmaker in town to help her. I am going to have a baby if its a boy it will be called [male name] if its a girl it will be called [female name]. I will still collect stamps and encourage my ten year old girl at games and P.E. My homelife is not to bad as I enjoy cooking and my daughter does the washing and wiping up. She will help me a good deal. The garden has a fish pond in it with 4 weeping willows round it, where my daughter lives to play. We have a wide lawn round the edge and a border all round the edge. The house has 4 bedrooms a big kitchen and a living and dining room we have a piano in the living room. We also have a colour television in the living room. The radiogram is in the dining room and the playhouse is round the far side of the house there is a drive up to the front door where we have planted crocuses. The front garden is a quilt of flowers packets of seeds have been thrown any old how into the earth. There is a path through the middle and a stream hidden away behind the flowers. Where goblins are fishing swimming swinging and dancing where insects swoop down to sip the water.  Words: 250
