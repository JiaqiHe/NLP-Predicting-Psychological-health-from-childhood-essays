I am married although I have no children. We live in a bungalow in [civil parish]. I have a part time job, working in an office in [surname]s. I go to work in the afternoon and so I clean the bungalow in the morning. One day I hope to leave my job and bring up a family instead. My interests lie in dancing, and every Saturday evening my husband and I go to a dance. I can play the piano and recorder. At home in the morning when my husband is at work my job is to make the bed and sweep and dust all the rooms. Then I make the dinner. I arrive at work at about 1 o'clock. In the office there are about ten other woman all typing out letters like me. When I arrive home I start to make the tea. My husband arrives home about six. After we have had our tea and washed up we sit down and watch the television. While I watch television I do knitting. At the moment I am knitting a jumper for my husband. On Sundays when the weather is nice and it is not a special date when we go to church, we go for a drive in the country. We take out tea with us and we picnic by a lake. Here we stay until about nine o'clock when the sun is just setting. It is a wonderful sight.  Words: 242
