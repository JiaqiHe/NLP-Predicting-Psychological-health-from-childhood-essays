I had been in the navy seven years, and now I had been discharged. I had became a captain of a frigate, but now the days were over I started to lead a peaceful life as a shop-keeper. I owned a green grocer's shop, and I managed to buy a boat and an out-board engine. I sold most vegetables, and some sweets, I close the shop all day Sunday so that I can go out boating and fishing. I open the shop at 9 a.m. and close at 5.30 pm.  Words: 90
