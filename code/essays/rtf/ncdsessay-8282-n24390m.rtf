I have not got married yet, but I am engaged. My work is at a nusery school ([school]) but I am not really interested in it. My spare is for Poetry or Athletics. I have recently made up a poem about The Eagle. And it has been published. 
      My home life is not dull, my brother is now 19 years of age. My sister is 31.
      I go to work at about 8.00 and get there about at 8.30. I leave at 3.45 and get home at about 4.15.
      I go to [location] for my Athletic's Training, and [name] trains me.  Words: 102
