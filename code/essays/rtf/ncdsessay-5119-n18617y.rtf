I am 25 and I am 3 ft 1inch and I way 6 stones. I have a part time job as a nurse. I am married and have 2 children. I get up a 7-o-clock in the morning have a good breakfast and a wash. I am at the hospital at 8-o-clock, I wash my hands well and start getting the patients up when I have done that I make beds. The sister of the hospital then tells me to take temparatures. Some patients are not aloud to drink bear* or drink like that. The visitors who come brings the patients a bottle of bear. If we find out we don't shout we speak firm but kind. After a morning's work it is dinner. I have 3 quarts of an hour for that. I go home in my car and get a dinner ready for my husband and children. My husband is an electrician and comes home at 4-o-clock. At quarter-to-one. I go back to the hospital and help with the patients. This afternoon I am just arranging flowers which people have sent to patients when I have done that there propbably is another accident come in. like a child who has had a dog bike and needs a tetinos jab. I would do that or another nurse. At half past three I go home for good. If I have any spare time at home I clear up and then go* fetch the children from school. Then all the family have tea, then we watch telly or go out.  Words: 259
