I wake up in the morning at half past seven. Get dressed and go downstairs. My husband goes out at the same time as I do he is a directer. Today I am going to Top of the Pops. My husband said that Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich were on the show. We have not got any children. I like dancing I used to do ballet when I was younger.
