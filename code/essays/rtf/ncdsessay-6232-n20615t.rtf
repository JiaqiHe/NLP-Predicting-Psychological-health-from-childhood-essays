Now that I am 25, I like helping mummy at home, doing the cooking etc. I like u**** and collecting stamps. I have got a job as a girl floom at a stable, and I enjoy my work with the horses. It may not be a very profitable job, but I enjoy it, as I like horses. I still enjoy drawing and writing short stories, but they are not nearly good enough to be published (yet;) I hope I will get one published though. My sister is 21 now, and she whes reading, much the same as me. I still like cooking, and looking after animals, especially cats and horses and dogs  Words: 112
