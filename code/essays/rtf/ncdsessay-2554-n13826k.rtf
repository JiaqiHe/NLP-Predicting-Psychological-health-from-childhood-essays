I am in the RAF flying one of the latest types of aircraft. My job in the air force is to fly to diffrent countries, and diliver very secret plans and messages. My favourite hoby is football and Iam in the station team as goalkeeper. I live in a flat with a mate. I like to muck around with engines. I am ingaged to get married. I go to go cart tracks and racing car tracks and football matches. I used to like go cart racing very much when I was 10-13. I am very happly with my job and when I stop flying hope to become a man in the control tower of a spaceport. I am leading a very nice and happy life with the air force.  Words: 129
