If I was 25 year old, I would get marrid and go to work at a shop, then I mite go and look after animals. I would look after a child but I wouldn't rase one muyself. If I was quite rich I would go to differant country's and a house with a maid. I would like to see all the differant places.
If I did work at a place were you look after animal I would clean them feed them, but I would hate to be a doctor to the animal. The shop that I would like work at would be a Mark and Spenpeds or interanation Stores. I would like to pake the things a bage or put thing out and label them. The husban would be rich and handsome, and quite stronge. The places I would go would be like germany the West Indians and New Zealand.  Words: 149
