I will teach my children how the play football if it a boy and my wif e teach netball if its a little girl. I hope they will be good runers like me. And come nights in the week I will out for a drink with my wife and our frends and then will mite have a rest up a sentrpark. When I come home from work I will have a game of tennis or billerds. If I don't get a job as a sports teacher. I will buy a little shop and open it as a sweet shop. and every wensday I will go to get some more stocke at the sales room.
