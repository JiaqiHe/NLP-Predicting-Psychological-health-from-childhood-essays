Every day I would get up at half past seven and go to work and stay there nearly* all day coming back a six o'clock. I would have a late tea. Sometimes I would be asked to go to a dance I enjoy myself coming back at two o'clock. Sometimes in a year I would have to go abroad for buisness and come back exausted. A week later I would go to my parents for a night. Every night or sometimes I would go to the pub.  Words: 87
