To me I think that I'm an aduilt now because I'me twenty five and I am. But I'm not getting enough to support me for two weeks. thats why I'm looking for anouther jod. You see I think that a girl of twenty five should be earning more money than 20 pounds a fortnight. So now I've got a new jod as a shorthand typist and I'm getting 20 pounds a week. And I can still go on running of a Sunday morning and fullfill my life ambition to run in the Olimpice games. As I'm a shorthand typist I sometime home work and have to stay up quit later of a night to get it all finished in time. to take to work in the morning.  Words: 127
