I work in the Natural History of ancient creatures in New York North America. It is rather a good job, interesting. I live in an apartment in on of the grand hotels. I like studeing about dinosaur skeletons in the muesuum* which help me a lot. I also like swimming as well, In the out-door swimming pools. When there is nothing to do I read a book or a magazine. And **sk book* for jokes to tell my friends at work. Its not a very high paid job, because its my job to keep the skeletons clean. But the superviser lets me do some studies with him though. Its a good life here in America working at the muesuem. I like the apartment to, its peaceful anyway. I'm on the fifteenth story. In my spare time I go to the swimming pool, where I either sit on a deck chair, are have a swim. My day of is sunday that is when I go to the swimming pool after mass. I usely go to bed about half past ten at night. There is a lot of things to clean at the muesuem. Great big things. For some I have to stand on a step ladder to reach to the top. On sunday afternoons I do studies on on dinosaurs at home for about an hour then * go for a walk somwhere. Sometimes through me of the parks.  Words: 238
