When I am 25 I will probally me married and I'll work at a hairdressers and if I am not married by then I would like to emigrate with my family to Australia because people say it is good over there and the jobs are good. I have a good home and I like it very much. The people are very good I work with I start work at 8 oclock nearly every morning except Sunday and I don't finish till half past six at night. And my day off work is on a Tuesday and I useally tidy up for my mother when Im off and sometimes I go out to the pictures or to the town for some shopping. At night time I sometimes like to go out and enjoy my self.  Words: 134
