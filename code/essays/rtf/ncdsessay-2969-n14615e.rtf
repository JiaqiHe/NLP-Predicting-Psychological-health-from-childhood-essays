I am a veterinary surgeons assistant and one day I hope to become a fully quallified veterinary surgeon I live with my mother and my father and I am interested in music. I go in for festivals and play the piano. At work I am very busy as I have all the dogs their vaccinations. I sometimes help with operations too. At home I also do quite a lot of office work and I barely get time to go out. Also I visit houses to see that their pets are all right. If they are not well I take them to the surgery and examine them. Sometimes we keep dogs at the surgery for owners when they are on holiday. I puppy walk some dogs training to be guide dogs, and I take them to a training class every week. There they learn how to walk to heel, sit, down and stay. After they have been trained I take them on to the busy road in the town. After some weeks they go to London to meet their blind owner. You really do miss them after a time but soon you begin again with another dog. I soon hope to be married and settle down and have some children. Of course when I get married i will get a dog for my children. I also hope to have a surgery of my own with all the equipment needed for an operations and I also would like a study at my own house. Sometimes I go to a main surgery where I help at operations. I have got deveral pets at home who are very healthy indeed.  Words: 276
