I am a student at university. I am studying the life of birds, how they build nests, what they feed on and all the interesting things there is to be found about them. I like to be alone sometimes, to think private thoughts and settle down with a good book. What I like to do best is to go out into the country and be alone with nature. My main interest hovers around wild life. Someday I'm going to be a great naturalist. I'm not so keen on society. I never get along with people much. I like to sit at home and watch television, or is nothing good is on, then I like to sit and talk with someone quiet. I'd like to do something really unusual. I ive a quiet sort of life, though I read books about mystery and wonder, excitement and adventure. Anything exciting and a flame shoots up inside me. I like the work that I'm doing. I like to spend hours reading about it. I like to sit back in a comfortable armchair at home with a fire blazing in front of me. Then I think about facts and figures, and fathom out problems. I think about what it is like to be the wonderful age of 25.  Words: 214
