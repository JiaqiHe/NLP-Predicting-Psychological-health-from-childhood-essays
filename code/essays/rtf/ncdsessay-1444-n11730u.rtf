I think I would like to be a proffeshnell football if I am good enough, if not a School teacher. I would work hard for the club I was part of, and carry on to be a manger. of the club: I would like motor racing as a hobby. If I was a school teacher I would like to be a games master at a senior school I have always liked sport so I think I would like it very much. I would buy a car and try to be a fit player. My main ambitoin in life is to play for England even if I only played onece or be a reserve for the team. If none of these things worked out I think I would either go into industry or the Navy I like boats and the sea I should like to serve on a submarine. The submarines of tomorrow will be a vast improvement on the ones of today, the thought of gliding along underwater fascinated me. It is hard to say what life will be like in about fifteen to sixteen years to come. I like football as it is today in a few years time we will propely have computers for referees and the same for the linesman I would'nt like to think that a cup like the the world cup lay in the hands of a machine. it does - not sound very nice to me. I like to watch motor racing I like speed even if it's only in my bicycle it's faster than walking.  Words: 262
