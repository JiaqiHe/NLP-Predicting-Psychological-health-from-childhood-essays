It took from ten at night to seven in the morning till we reached [xxxxxxx]. I was on my feet the hole time first of all I was helping people to get on the train next some one was sick I had to get a bucket out of a shop by the station which was still open. I was just getting back to the train when it nearly went with out me. But luckily I scaped on in time. By the next morning I was tired. After that I went on as a airplane pilot that was not so bad.
