I lead a quite life as a nurse I have been intrested in nurseing since I was small At week ends I come home to see my parents I have learnt many new things in nurseing and enjoy my job. Nurseing helps many people to get better or wounds to heel. When off duty I keep my self oypied by reading or going out to danceing with my friends I have been a nurse 6 years now and hope to carry on along while more I am intrested in cooking and at weekends I do alittle cooking for my parents. They do not mind me being away through the week and enjoy my home coming. I work all through the day sometimes I'm on night duty but not often. Every year I get a weeks holiday if I'm not needed badley at the hospitle. I learn more each day about what can happen to people and what treatment they nead and how they nead looking after. Some just come for cheak up. Others come for mentle treatment. Many of the people who are getting alot better can get up and watch Television others must stay in bed and rest as much as they can. I am kept very busy most of the time I'm in the wards.  Words: 217
