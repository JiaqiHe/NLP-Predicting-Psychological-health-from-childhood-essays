I have a wife and a child, a boy whose name is [male name] his is aged 2. At home I make cupboards and put up shelves and I sometimes bring home some half finished paintings, or sculptures to finish off, and when they are finished I sell them in my shop. At the back of my shop there is a workshop where myself and five other people who I employed are doing paintings and sculptures, some of the things that I do a worth up to one-hundred pounds. I have only another couple of interests and that is reading and writing books and then hoping that they might be published. To get some or most of my paintings I go out into the country find a scene which I think will look nice if in* painted and just paint it. When I do this they fetch up to quite high prices.
