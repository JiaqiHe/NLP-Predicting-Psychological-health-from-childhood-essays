At the age of twenty-five I 've got a job as a window dresser. My hobbies are stamp collecting. If I could have another job I would choose to work in a pet shop, as I am very fond of animals. In my spare time I sometimes go to London for the weekend and perhaps get a better job in a bigger store. At home I would read books. Sometimes I would go out with my friends to a party or a dance.
     As a window dresser I have to dress up for models in the clothes from the store a put them up in the shop windows for people to look at. Also if decorations are needing they have to be made from things from the store. If I worked in a pet shop I would feed the animals and see that they were quite alright. After work is finished for the day I take a bus home and have tea sometimes I might meet my friends and we would all go out together. At the weekends when I haven't much to do I help Mum with the house work.
     If I got married I would give up my job and stay a home with my children until they were old enough to go to school, then I would get a part time job but always making sure that I was in when they came home in the afternoon from school. Most of the week I  Words: 247
