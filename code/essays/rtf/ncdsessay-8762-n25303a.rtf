I have joined the Royal Navy, and I have to go away on a Naval ship, called, H.M.S. Ark Royal for two years, the Ark Royal in an aircraft carrier,  I would probably think the ship would leave about October. The captain gives the order, full-speed ahead and off we go, probably to the Far-East or somewhere like that. I would send letters to all my friends, and they would send them to me. When I get there I would buy presents for all my friends, we probably would stop a few days, at each place we visited on the way, also on the way back.
When the time is up and we arrive in the dockyard and my friends and other peoples friends as well, and give out presents to each other.  Words: 132
