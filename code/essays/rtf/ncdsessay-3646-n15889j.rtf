I am an air hostess. I go to interesting places all over the world, at each place I go I make new friends. I am very keen on sewing and I make all my clothes that I take on holiday with me. When I have holiday's I usually go to visit my parents and stay with them a day or so, then I go back to my flat and give it a spring clean, I usually invite some of my best friends over and make a special tea. My work is interesting and exciting, I have seen alsorts of famous places and when I am old and retired I will settle down and live in the country.  Words: 117
