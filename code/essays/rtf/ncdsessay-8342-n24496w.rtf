By the age of twenty five I would have liked to have completed a course at a university. By this time I would like to be married. I expect my intrests will not change a great deal. Reading will, I expect, will still be a main interest as will watching football. I think I will still like swimming. 
If I am married I would like to go out to work, I would like a flat and would work in it myself, which, I think I will enjoy.
If I am not married I will not mind living at home. I would like to live nearer the West End, because* I go up to town a lot now so I expect I will, when, twenty five, I would prefer to marry someone who would live at home and not travel around the country to much because I would not always be able to go with because of work.
