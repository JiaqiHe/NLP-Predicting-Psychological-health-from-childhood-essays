I am now 25 years old today. the start of a new year for me to beggin. I am still living with my mum and dad who are getting old now. My brother has got married and so there's only 5 people at home my handycaped brother is now 24 1 years younger and the youngest is now 22 all three of us in our twentys Brian and a girl are planing to get married next month. I am not very lonely now as I use to be when. I was left on my own. I still have my pet which is still full of life I work in the morning a hairdresser and night time at chivers which in quiet enough for me as a hair dresser I don't earn much money as I only charge a little 10/- for a hair cut it use to be 3/- per cut. but now things have changed for me the decimal system has been out for years now so. I just worked out in pounds and shilling for you to under stand other u*** it would be 50 new pence I have about 4 people a day so I get 400 new pence a day which is not to bad. At night times I go to chivers to work we get 20 pounds a week nearly 4 times as much 14 years ago I return at 10 pm at night my mum and I go together who is going to retire soon as she's in the sixtys live has nearly come to the end for a lot of people. I know as they were my friends' mothers I hope my mum lives and never die.  Words: 284
