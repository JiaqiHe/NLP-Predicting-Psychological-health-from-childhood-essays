----------------------
I go out to work, I am a part time teacher, I teach Maths and Music. The school starts at nine o'clock and finishes at four o'clock. The school is a girls one. It is quite an old building, in which there are about 300 pupils. I get up at 8 o'clock. I work Monday, Wednesday afternoon and Friday morning. Out of schooL I enjoy listening to the radio, at about 10 o'clock.
      I still like reading, but now I like murder and love stories. Most of them are paperback. I like going to clubs. 
      I do not want to be a teacher very long as it is quite tiring if one has rude or stupid pupils, and also because the pupil do not like me because I am stricter than most other teachers.
      I do not like the other teachers as most of them are fifty or sixty and they think I am modern. They all wear drab and dulL clothes not long enough to be a maxi and not short enough to be a mini about knee length, and also they think I am too young to be a teacher aech thinking that they have much more teaching ability than me, when the teacher I got at collage is more affient, and modener. 
      I live at home at the moment but I hope to get married soon.  Words: 231
