I work from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock. I get good money and I enjoy it there. The children are hard to handle but I manage all right. Most of the time I am out it the garden digging out the weeds. I hate doing the washing, washing up, clearing up etc. I have been maryed for four and a half years. While I go to work I have somebody to look after the babies.
