I was married at 24 years old. My wife is a fine one a one that can take a lot of fun. We live out in the country near [name of forest] Forest. Our house is not new but it is nice. My interests are Fishing and watching animals run about in the fields. I love animals that is why I became a zoo keeper a few months back. I take care of the cats which are, lions, tigers leopards, pumas and a cheetah. The zoo is called [name of zoo] zoo. My wife does not work she keeps the house tidy. When it is very hot we eat our lunch on the front garden. Travelling shops come around and that's where my wife gets all our food.  Words: 128
