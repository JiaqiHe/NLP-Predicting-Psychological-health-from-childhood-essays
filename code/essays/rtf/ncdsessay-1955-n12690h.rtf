I have a job as a footballer for Sheffield United. In my time I am not playing I have a paper shop about a mile away from the house. Also I have a caravan at cornwall. I have a car and hope to have some children. When I grow older I hope to be a manegar. I have a very nice house just outside Sheffield near the country. I have a bit of land and hope to buy some more. If. I gave my job up I would like to live in Germany. I think Germany is much nicer than England. I would like to have another paper shop in Munich. I would not like to leave all my freinds. If I could not get a job I would like to ride horses. And also in my spare time play golf with my dad. I am in [locality] golf club.  Words: 150
