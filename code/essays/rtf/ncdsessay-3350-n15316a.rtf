I am at collage and I am lurning to paint which is my intrerest. I have won a prize for a modern arcotect I made, and a medal for a painting a drawed of a cottage near [location], with a stream runing near the cottage.
At the end of the day I change my books and read and studey and when that over I go for a strowl then come back and go to bed. 
The end of the turmn I go home to find every thing the same as before. I help, wash up cook and take my parents for a run in the car in the country.
At home I paint and make models like I do at collage.  Words: 119
