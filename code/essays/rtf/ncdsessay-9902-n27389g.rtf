In 14 years I will be 25, but I am going to tell you what I hope it will be like. The job I would like is with animals in the zoo, I don't mind the cleaning of the animals house because I am use to cleaning out a horses stable. And also I can control a horse Quite easly. I am not afraid  *of any animal (excpected a loin that is runing at me). 
      When I went to the zoo about 6 months ago I was playing with a rinoe and an elphant got out of it house a was runing round the zoo
I am not sure if I want to get marraid or have any children I hope I will have a big house with a big garden and I expect I will still ride, If I do not  get a job at a zoo. I will try to be a show jumper. I can jump a horse called grey spy (he is very fast and high spirited) over a 3 foot jump I will heve a black horse and will call it Black Bouity like the book Black Bouity. that anne swell wrote. If I do have some children I will by a pony for them and call it marrying's like the Pany in Black Buaity and if I have* another horse* I will make Sure it is ginger so I can call it ginger and if I buy the mother of the horse that will be my jumping horse I will call it Duchess and when I am not jumping I will brake hores in and teach* children how to ride. I will try to teach my children how to jump a horse.  Words: 288
