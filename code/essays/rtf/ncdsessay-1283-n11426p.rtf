----------------------
I am leading a great ife, my intrests are rallying (car) and racing, my work as a telivision director is rather tiring after all 2 programmes a week is a bit hard on one, But I manage. I keep a small house in London near Elstree where I often produce, although I have directed at other studios. My car is a MGB GT which takes me nice and fast down to the docks where we sometimes film. I direct a secret Agent programme actually. Anyhow my house is in [street name] London. I often direct abroad so I use the studio helicoper or my own plane to go to Southend Airport to fly abroad, I was filming last week in Holland, the week before Germany. Next week I'll be in Japan perhaps? I really don't know. About my home life I am not married for a start. In what little spare time I get at the studios I sleep I shoot wildfowl at Romney Marshes on occasion. Often I take my holidays in Kent  Words: 174
