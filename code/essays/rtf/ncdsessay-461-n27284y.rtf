I play football for Leeds UTD I thought that is very good and I am very happy with my money and I am very content. I have two cars one Ford Escort and 1 ford capri. I have a very nice Day at the Leeds cluB. I talk to the players and the manager, I am not married but I am engaged to some one. On Teusdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays I work in an employment office, I start at nine oclock and finnish at four thirty. I go home and get my tea and then go out some where and then come back at 5:30 and Just sit down and read I have a nice Life. Next morning I would get up and washed and ready by 8.00 and then go to the cluB and have a football Practice and then sit down then read and wright I think it is Great.  Words: 152
