I am 25 years old and I lived in **** all my life I have lots of interest like building balsa* airoplane molds* that fly I like reading books like treasure Island, kidnapped and thrillers. I have a happy life playing football for **** I scored 96 goals this season. I go to night clubs with the boy and getting a few bruses by the time I get home. The green up the road I go and fly my radio controlled airoplanes and the other day I took one of my planes up to the green and fly it, and it got out of control and I had to send it for a crash landing and instead of crash landing it flew away with the wind I went home thinking I had lost it but when I got into the garden I found that it was in our next door neighbours garden so ale* I had to do was go round and ask for it.
