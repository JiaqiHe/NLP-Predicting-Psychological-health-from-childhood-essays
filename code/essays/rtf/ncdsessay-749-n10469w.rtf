----------------------
I am twenty five and I work in an office, doing short-hand typing. I live at home with my parents, But very soon I will be getting married. I have some hobbies and interests, which are swimming, dancing, and I like singing, although I have'nt got the voice to sing on a stage, or in concerts.
      I go to work every day, except Saturdays and Sundays, and I like my work very much. I never get bored when I am home from work, for I am either in a dancing school, or probably taking my younger sister for a walk,
When I get married I am going to live in [city] still, and I am going to try and get a house somewhere in the country side. And while I am single I will stay at home and help my mother with the work, around the house, and when I am married still I will still carry on my dancing, swimming and singing.
      I also travel to different countrys like Switszaland Germany, France, and South Africa. I like to have a wardrope full of clothes, plain but attractive, and I am very fussy, in my appearence. I think I lead a very joyable life, except when everything goes wrong.  Words: 208
