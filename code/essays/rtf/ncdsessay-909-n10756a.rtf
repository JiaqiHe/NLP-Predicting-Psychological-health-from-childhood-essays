My name is [female name] and I am 25 years old. I am married with 2 children. I was married when I was 21 years old. My oldest child is 3. His name is [male name]. My youngest is one and that is a girl. Her name is [female name]. My husband and I love them very much. My husband [male name] works as a plumber. I do not work as I have to watch the children and cook. Before I was married I planned to be a school teacher. My life is mainly spent as a housewife. I have very few interests. My main interests are swimming, reading and liesure. We live in a bungalo. It is our own house. We would not change it for anything. When [female name] is about five or six I think I will start working. Then I will have to find a school for her. We each have a car of our own. We both go out sometimes to a dance etc. None of us smoke or drink. The children have very good friends. We think we have brought them up the correct way. This is my story and I am pleased with the way I spend my life, and spare time.  Words: 209
