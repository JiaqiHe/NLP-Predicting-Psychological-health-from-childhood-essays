I am married to a man, I live in a house in London, I work as a secatary. Later on I would like to look after children all over the world, I am hoping to do this because I would probably travel all over the world. On my days off I would like to play tennis and swim, and invite people to dinner, when I leave my Job as a secatary, I would try and get the Job of looking after children if I could not get this Job, I would try and get a Job as an Air Hostess, to get a Job as an Air Hostess you have to speak many languages. What I would really want to do is become an actress, then if I became famous and rich I could travel all over the world, but I wouldn't like to be to rich. I would travel from place to place and make many friends, I would meet interesting people, some would probably be dull and boring and others interesting and gay, I would also like my husband to be an actor so that we could probably act together in the same film, and travel together all over the world, and when I had a holiday I would visit my parents, and visit all my of Friends, I'd stay there for about a weke and then I'd go on holiday to Greece, and travel onto Israel and to Cyprus when my sister was born and thern onto Rhodesia where my mother was born.
After my holiday I would start making films with my husband, I would ride on horses and play tennis in my spare time, also I would love to have a house in France.  Words: 288
