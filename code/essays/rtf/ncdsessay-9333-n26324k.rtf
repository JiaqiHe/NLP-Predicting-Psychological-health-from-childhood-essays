I am twenty-five I am tat University studing French, Latin and Mathematics. I hope to become a teacher of French Latin and Mathematics at a girls grammar school. I do not mind working at this level and I enjoy it very much. I often go out with my friends to watch tennis and I often play tennis myself. I have nearly finnished my studing and although I have enjoyed my self very much here I am looking forward to getting a job. When I have a holiday I go home to parents in Surrey for a few weeks and then I go on a club holiday because in the holidays I am a club assistant leader. This year we are going away to the Lake Distrect At University we have quite a few nice master but some of them are very strict I like going to the lectures very much and if I cannot become a teacher I would like to become a lecturer. I like helping others and becoming a teacher or a lecturer, I think helps people to become* what they want to become. In my spare time I read a lot and when I can go* swimming.  Words: 200
