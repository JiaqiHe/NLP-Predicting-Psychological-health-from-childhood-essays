In the mornings I go to work on the train with my type writer in my case and a few papers. I usually meet my friend on the train as she's in the same department at work as me. We work for Mr Crabb and his wife as well. At dinner I have a small lunch in our Canteen at 2 o'clock. I must be back in my department and start the dictation. I usually write about six pages afterwards I have a cup of tea and perhaps something to eat. We have half an hours break, When I get back I typed the dictation out and set in off to 100, [xxxxxxx]. In the evenings sometimes with my husband we go to the Cinema or visit some friends. My husband bought a car that day and it is called a Viva Deluxe.  Words: 143
