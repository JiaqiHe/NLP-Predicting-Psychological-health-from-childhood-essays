When I grow up I want to look after my pets and do a lot of painting. I have a lot of pets Birds, Cats, dogs, lizards and so on. It costs a lot of money to feed them all. A lot of my frogs have died because someone comes in and puts them on a rock and they get dried up and die but now they are in a safe place.  Words: 72
