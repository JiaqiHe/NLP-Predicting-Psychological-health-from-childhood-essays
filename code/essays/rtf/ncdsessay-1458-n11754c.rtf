When I am 25 I would like to live in a house not to big and not to small. The place I would like to live in would be quiet. I would like three bedroom so that I can have two children. I would like a blue door and a nice small garden at the frond but a little bit bigger at the back. In the kicthen I would like the floor red and the kicthen can be not to small. I would had a big bed in are bed-room. In the childrens if I had a boy and gril they can have their toys in a cupboard. I would go round the house and make it clean every day. We would live near a seaside so that the children can go to it. In the house I would like one pet and that is a carnry. Downstairs I would like a nice blue carpet and big blue flowers one. There will be some pictures on the wall. And there might be nice chairs.  Words: 174
