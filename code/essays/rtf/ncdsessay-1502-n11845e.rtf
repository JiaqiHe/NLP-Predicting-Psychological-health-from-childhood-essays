When I am twenty five I should like to be working, but at about twenty seven I should like to settle down and start a family of a boy and two girls. I also should like to live in a fairly big house, but not to many rooms, I should like all the girls to have fair hair and the boys dark hair. When it was time for them to go to school I should like them to get on well, and when they get to the bigger school I should like them to pass their exam. But befor then I should like life to be very pleasent for me and my husband. I should like him to be a teacher and befor that a studnet at any school.  Words: 129
