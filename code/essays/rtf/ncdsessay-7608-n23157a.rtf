If I were twenty five I would like to be a bank manager and keep the peoples money safe. My home would be a big one with two children. My interests would be in maths and other studies I would have a rest at home and then do the house work. I would have a assitant when I was working The bank would be made of solid brick. I would have a husband that was rich and good natured. My home life would be easy at week ends and at week days it would be very hard. Also in my home life I would make dresses, skirts, and Jumpers for the children and my self. My own money would go in to the bank straight away. I would take a little of it out at a time. I would keep two or three pounds to spare each week. I would have to be careful with the money when checking it. My bank would be open from 9 am in the morning to 4.15 pm at night. My assitant would write the books up for me.  Words: 185
