"Now I am 25 years old, I am working as a sales man I often go abroard. I sometimes am abroard for 1 to two weeks. I lead* a live of traveling. In my spear time I am very intrested in the wild animals of each country I visit, I spend my free time looking at these animals. My home is in London I have a small house with a big garden I look at the birds in my own garden. At work abroard, I often stay in hotels in big towns. Once when I was in London I got picked up by the police for they thought I was a nother man. They gept me in for two hours then they said ""they were sorrey"". When I am at home at weekends I often go to the park or to the cinima, I have a wife. If I am not in the park or cinima I often go to the golf club I am not bad at Golf. But It is not often I am home at weekends, for I often have a few days at home in the week. I have a small office in London but I am not often in it, this is were I do bits of paper work. The office is just out side the City of London. When I am abroard I do not like some of the countrys dishes so I often have a English breakfast the same for all my other meals. I often do not have my meals in the hotel for I meet* people in the restraunts. The country I like going to best is France and Germany and Holland."  Words: 281
