I am working as a aprentice welder and I am trying to past my test on welding. I have made a lot of friends and I am very happy. The place wher I work is ICI. In my spare I buy stamps. I have lots of stamps now and I am getting my thir album sone. I am still living in the house I've lived in nearly all my live. I am married and have a baby boy. I have traveld a lot, and I go fishing a lot as well. I have a dog and a rabbit. I have past some of my test's, at my college. I have also a collection of coin's. I collected them because the decimal coin's have taken their place. When I am off work I go down town to buy things for the baby. I make little chiars and try to sell them I have made one for the baby. When I have enough time I wallpaper the room. At my works when we have lunch break we play a lot of cricket. I am saving up some money to go to Scotland, also I saving money for a car so that we can travel more.  Words: 203
