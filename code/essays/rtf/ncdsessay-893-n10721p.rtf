I am 25 years old with a very good job which is working in a bank with my sister. I go to work in the morning at eight o'clock and come back at twenty past six. I work at trusty's bank in London. My friends are very nice and help me out with things I have to know. At lunch time I eat my dinner in the canteen with my friends.
I am interested in playing the guitar but I have to keep on going over bits. My hobbies are the same but I have to do part of the cooking. I don't go roller skateing anymore. I make most of my clothes and do quite a lot of knitting. I go to a club of judo.
In the week ends I sometimes visit friends and always travel in my car. When I'm free I bak e acake or else make the dinner. I have saved up for a holiday to France, for two weeks with my friend. I am going to have a lot of fun with her. Most of the spare times I go bowling. I go swimming to.  Words: 189
