I am married to a man called [male name] [surname]. I have 2 girls called [female name] and [female name]. I work at a place* called [business name]. its just across our road I don't need to worry about the children because my mother-inlaw lives with us so she looks after them. I put the tablets in the bottles, sometimes I put to many in or another time I don't put a enough. So we don't get hair in the bottles we have to put white hats on, or white overalls to stop the powder getting on our clothes. On Saturday nights I go down the [street name] Club with my husband. or go to partys sometimes we get in at 1'oclock in the morning. On Sunday mornings I cook the dinner and in the afternoons we go to play tennis or go for a swim. My interests are cookery, sport, reading, going out and enjoying myself. I like staying up to watch the midnight films.  Words: 166
