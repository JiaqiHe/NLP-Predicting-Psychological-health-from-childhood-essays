If I was a Toy-maker when I am Twenty Five I would make about 2,000 Toys with other people then I would have a Shop of my own. I could have a large Shop like pricerites. Then I would make a notice for people to work in the Shop, when I have got the asistants to apply I would have two counters for baby things with toys like Pushchairs furry teddy bears and dolls. Then I would have a counter with Shoes and Sandals, Plimsoles. then a counter of Shoes for grown ups, After that some Stools for chrildren of 10 to 14 with toys in then that would be an up Stairs department, and I would have moving Stairs to go up and moving stairs to go down, because if you brough a lot you would walk down the Stairs and be in other peoples way, where if you had moving stairs you would have one Step to a person. And you wouldent be alble to carry it down. In the downstairs department I would have a counter with cinny camra thing and films for the camra Set and I would Sell cases With your camra in, and I would have people to Show you how to work them. Then I would have a Stool for Jewrely and a counter for make up. After that I would have mens clothes in a corner where they sell Suits Jackets trousers Shirts and all things for men to wear. then after that a counter for womans things then I would have an advertisment. But I have to have a lot of money to have a Shop of my own.  Words: 278
