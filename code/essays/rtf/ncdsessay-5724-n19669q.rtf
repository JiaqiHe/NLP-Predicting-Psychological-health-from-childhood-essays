I live in a cottage in the contry I keep my cottage tidy because I can't stand a untidy house. I have two children, two girls one's called [name] and the other called [name]. My husband is a police man and I am a teacher in a Junior School and my favourite hobby is finding more about Britain My two children are well mannerd not very noisy. [name] is 3 and [name] is 3 they are twins. My husband and I like walking about the country side. My other hobby is reading exciting stories once I get a exciting story I can hardly take my nose out of it. One thing I dislike is cooking and sewing I can't stand them. My husband is well mannerd and dislike's drinking and smocking. I do not smock but sometimes I drink. My favourite drinks are shandy and Bitter lemon. My children* sometimes are naughty but they get smacked for it. My children are also tidy. I have a very bad temper. My husband is tall and very well built and has a beard  Words: 181
