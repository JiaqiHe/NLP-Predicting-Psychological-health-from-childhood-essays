I have just brought my first shop, it is an out-door. The only thing we don't sell is papers. Each Saturday go to see Manchester City. I have a friend who comes in the shop every morning, who all-ways bys at least 5 packets of polo. He can get me any cup tickets or away match tickets. My house is above the shop we have three bedrooms, a living room, and kitchen. We have two boys a one girl, a dog, cat and two rabits. The boys are 3 years, 2 years and the girl is 6 months.
