If I was 25 I would most probely move to some place away from [town]. I woudnt mind moving back to London. The life I would lead would be as I hope now a footballer but I can't say at the moment as I'm not old enough. I would like to play as goalkeeper if I do make it to some club. I'd like a few pets but I wouldn't want to much but I am fond of animals. I am not sure wheather I would stay on to at school for another year. I would like to spend holidays abroad to other countries like Spain france or Italy. I would'nt wear my hair long so it came right down low but there again I would'nt want it to short on me. I might take an intrest in swimming I am not sure. I would like some type of moter vechial to get around to places on. I would like to be able to play some instrument such as a mouth organ or voilin (Which I have tried playing). I would'nt go to church regulary but I might go on the occasion of Easter, Christmas or some other time of the year.  Words: 202
