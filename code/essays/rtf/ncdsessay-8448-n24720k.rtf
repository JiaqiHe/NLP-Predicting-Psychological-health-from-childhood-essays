When I am 25 years of age I hope to be a footballer, well I would not start my cerria at 25, I would start about 19 years of age, and and my carria about at 38 years of age. But when I was 28, I would try and be in a first division side. and I would proubly in the forward line, on one of the wings. Most of my spear time, would be training. If I will be a profesal footballel, I will defently be in a northern club side, like Everton or Manchester City, or Leeds United. But all in my spear time I will go out with my wife, and my children, and when the summer comes, you will have time to go on your holiday probly, but you will have about 2 weeks. Then you will have to do more training for your next match to play. When May June and July and Augest come, you don't have any maches for four months, But the thing you will know if you play a bad match, and you are droped for about 4 game you will have to get over it. So when I am 25 years of age I hope I will be a 1st class Footballer.  Words: 212
