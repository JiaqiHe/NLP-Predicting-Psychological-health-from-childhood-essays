I have just left Zoo-ology collage and I now work at London zoo. I get up every morning at 6 o'clock and get ready for work. I go to work by car every morning at 8 am. I look after the cats all day every day exept Saturdays & Sundays. On Saturdays I have to Wash down the Elephants. On Sundays I have the day of and usually work out how long it will be befor I have enough mony for my own little game reserve. When I get home (6 o'clock) I study zoo ology. I have supper at 8' pm and go to bed at 10. When I have a holday I would spend my time at minehead or other parts of Devon. Every year juring Animal week I would help the RSPCA. collect door-door. Every monthly Sunday I would go to see dad. (IF HE'S still alive.). I would get a higher & higher possition at the zoo for the longer I Stay there.  Words: 167
