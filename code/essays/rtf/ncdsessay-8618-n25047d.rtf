The life I am now leading is very diffrent from the one I was leading a few years ago. A few years ago I was in school but now I am in a office working behind a desk. I sometimes go out with a girl friend. I still have carpentry as a hobby and stamp collecting. Sometimes When there is a new british stamp Isue I go to the post-office and bye it. My home life is also diffrent from what it used to be a few years ago. now I can go where ever I like, but before I had to do as I was told. I work in the office of a department store. The department store is situated in [road] near [road]. I have to make up acounts for the people who come in-to the store and buy things. The shop atendants send up the money and I have to give them the change, and send it the chang down again. The money goes up and down by a tube. I work in the clothing department of the store.
