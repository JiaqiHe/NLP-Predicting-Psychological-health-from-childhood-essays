"I am twenty five and I go to work in a hospital I have been going to (place) and I am fairly good I am hoping to look after little children but while I am a nurse I go home at four and start at six when i get home I cook my tea and wait for my husband to come in. The handle of the door moves and I push to the door and get my husbands slipper he has had a hard day's work at the office he goes into the lounge and he sits down at the read *id table after tea we go to my mothers and she makes us a cup of coffee because we don't like tea very much the I have to put the television on because my mother can't walk she had a bad foot when I was a baby I give her her supper and put her to bed then it is about ten when we leave and I did her washing and wiping up for her then we said ""Good night"" and turned off the light it is very dark but we were o.k. the when we got home we went to bed I spelt in a small room with a fairly big window then the alarm went in the morning at quarter too five and I pull back the curtain and get the toast on for breakfast then I was and dress and go out to work I look after the childrens ward today so I went along to the childrens ward **** of the babys had been burned like one of them their mother put the baby in boiling water without testing it I lead a happy life I go to have my dinner after I have taken the children to dinner then I get out a book I was reading and I read until my dinner is ready then I eat my dinner and go back on duty some people say it is a horrible life to lead if your a nurse but I don't think so I love nursing and I hope one day I will become matron it would be nice then I could go in with the children and look after them soon the day is over and I go home and get the tea the when my husband is in I sit down and read my magazine it is called woman and it is good I am following a story in it it is called hate to your wife but is good and I like to read the paper as well then I get out my sewing things and I am making my-self a summer dress it is a flowery material and it is going to have **** around the sleeves and round the neck and the edge it is not going to have any sleeves I would have liked to be a sewing teacher but I chose nursing when you are in a hospital you meet a lot of people good or bad. I don`t care who they are but I can say I have met them."  Words: 525
