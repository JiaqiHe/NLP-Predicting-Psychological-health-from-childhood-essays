I am a game warden in Africa. It reaches to about 120 Farenhight in the summer and 70 in the winter. There are many different kinds of birds in Africa and I like to watch them. I live in a hut with a high fence round it. the rest of my family live in Nairobie. My work is to stop hunters from shooting in the park, I also have to watch the migration of the animals. I also have to keep count of the number of animals in the park, I have a helicopter to help me, with this. Some days I have to Dart Animals and transfer them.  Words: 109
