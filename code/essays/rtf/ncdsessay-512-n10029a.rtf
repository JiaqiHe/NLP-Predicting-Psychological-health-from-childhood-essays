----------------------
I am now married, I have no children yet, and I got married when I was nearly 24 years old. I am a teacher at a junior school in Leeds. I am a teacher of reading, needlework, and art. At night I like to watch television with my husband or read an interesting book. I like my work very much. I enjoy my myself very much at the weekends. I sometime take my sisters, two little girls out for her, if she is very busy at the weekends. I visit my mother very often and try to take something up for her. I hope to have a baby of my own very soon. I never really have much time for going to the pictures at weekdays, but I try to go at the weekend. I sometimes go out with my friends if I have time when I get home from work. I get home at about half past-five to six a clock. I don't really have much time for shopping as I do it at the weekend. I go in town for most of my shopping, and the rest I do round abouts. My husband is a teacher as well but not at the same school as I. He is a teacher of woodwork art and geography and history. I hope to have a little girl if I did I would call it a name that we both agree on.  Words: 240
