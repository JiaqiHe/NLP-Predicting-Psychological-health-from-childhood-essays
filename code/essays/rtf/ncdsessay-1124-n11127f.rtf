I am twenty five to-day and I have got a one year old daughter her name is [female name] and my husbands name is [male name]. I am bakeing a cake for my own birthday [male name] brought me a glass rolling pin and some flowers, the flowers are irises and I like them very much. My next door neighbour gave me a nice big vase it was green, yellow, red and orange. [female name] had her first piece of chocolate this morning and she kept on dribbling I am used to it though as she is always doing it. I used to be a secretary a private one. 
Now I can do the odd Jobs about the house if I do not want any jobs I always get one by [female name] spilling somthing. Now the time is five o'clock and it is time for tea so I am going to get Julias bib and a clothe so I can wipe her face because she is always getting a dirty face and her nose.  Words: 175
