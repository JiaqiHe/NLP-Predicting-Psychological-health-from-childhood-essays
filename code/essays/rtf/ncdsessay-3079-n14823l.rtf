"I have just left University and beginning my new job. I am a teacher and starting with the smallest class in school ""the infants."" It is just after the Summer Holidays and there are a lot of children crying . It is difficuly trying to stop the crying and starting them with work.
I go out nearly every night of the week and my husband comes too. On Monday nights I go to the Youth Club whitch is good Tuesday nights I am a Brownie Captain Wednesday nights and Thursday nights I don't go anywhere , but stay at home watching my little baby. Friday night are the best , I go to the ""Golf Club."" My husband and I are very fond of golf and we play nearly every week-end. My mother watches my baby girl .
The school finishes at 3.30 p m, so I get home quiet quickley to clean the house but sometimes the house doen't need clean so go for all **** ****. This is Friday and I just can`t wait till ***** and tomorrow when I go the club and go **** I am a good golfer my handicap *** * ***** I started playing golf at the age of 10. At the age of 20 my handicap was 18 so your must say that I have improved .
