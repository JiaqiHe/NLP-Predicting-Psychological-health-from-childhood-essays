When I was 18 I went to Collage I studied for three years and then i became a teacher. I had had a class of 42 pupils and I taught English, my class were very good and hardly ever screamed and shouted. All my pupils were leaving that year so I was looking for another place to teach(eA)* I got a job at an **** primary school and taught for three years, in the meantime i had been saving up to go on a pleasure cruise. With my time I used to read looklets on pleasure criuses and study looks on English. When the day came for me to leave I was given a farewell present. And then. the time came for me to go. on the criuse. I was so exited that I could hardly wait, on the boat I met a young man who asked me to dine with him i axsepted very gratefully and went to dive. From then on we used to go swimming and we played tennis we had a lovely time and where we got back we were married and we emegrated to Aostralia.  Words: 190
