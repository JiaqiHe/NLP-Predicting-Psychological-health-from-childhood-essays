I am 25 years old I am working in a nursery and at home I have a beutiful garden with lots of lovely flowers. and some times when there is a football match on I will play. One day I would sit down and read the newspaper , a magazine or a comic to see what is intresting. I would often go out and weed the garden and plant more plants or even apple trees. at last what i have hoped for , it has come true .  Words: 88
