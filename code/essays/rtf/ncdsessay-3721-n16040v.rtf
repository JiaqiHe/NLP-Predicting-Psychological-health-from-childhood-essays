Now that I am old anough Mum and Dad let me ride by horse to suitable camping places. Of corse, much of the time I am working as an astrominer, so I only a little spare time. I also spend a lot of time grooming my horse, Swift. Another of my hobbies is sailing, and I often hire a ship or canoe. I share an observetry with a friend of mine. We have already spotted two new stars. I have very little home life, but what time I have at home is taken up by gardening. I would not want to work in an office.  Words: 105
