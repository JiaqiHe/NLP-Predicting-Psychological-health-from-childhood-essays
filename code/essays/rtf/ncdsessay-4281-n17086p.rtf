My name is [name] and I am 25 years old and I live in [location]. My main hobby is going to watch football matches. Sometimes I go to watch cricket matches but football is much better. I work in an office at a big factory. Mostly it is a very boring job but I like it. I am secretary of the sports commitee at the factory. We go to the sports field at nights after work to play football, cricket and tennis. I am a batchelor and I live in my own house about two miles from the factory. I also have an Austin Mini car which I go to work in and go to football matches in. I also play football for the factory team. I have quite a lot of money in a bank for when I retire from work. My house is out In the country so I have no neighbours. Except for a farm that is about two hundred yards away. And it is also very quiet with no one about. There is a camping site about half a mile away and quite a lot of people go there. My house is on a hill with a long drive down to the road. I have two brothers that live in the next town but no sisters. One of my brothers is a director in a bank and the other one owns a garage.  Words: 237
