my intrests are clay moddeling and wood work. I have a Job at a factory in [city] making guns for the army it is a very interesting Job and a very noisy Job but the noise dosn't bother me becouse I'm use to it. some people grumble But I don't see any reason to grumble becouse we get xxxx28 pounds a week and thats enough to keep the Family going. we have six children two girls and four boys. I like coming home from work becouse I can have a peacfull afternoon and when the children go to bed my wife and I watch the telivision and then we go out for a walk at eleven oclock and come in at hald past elleven and go to Bed. when I haev a day of I spend most of the day modeling and come times I make toys for my children for when its there Birthday and where lookking forward to getting a small flat. for my wife and I when the children are grown up. so you see you can't grumble at the age of twenty five becouse its not a very old age and you can always find somthing to do in your spare time I can remember when I was young I used to like wood work and if I couldnt do anything The wood work teacher would tell me never to give up and so from then onwards I have liked doing wood work. I am doing very well with my clay modeling I am making vases when I have finished making vases I will paint them and sell them and that will help with the house keeping  Words: 281
