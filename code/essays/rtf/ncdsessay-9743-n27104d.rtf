I am now twenty-five I have just left University I am married and I have one daughter. I still like ho*es, swimming and tennis. I like swimming the most and I belong to a swimming club
      I work at a big store in [city] in the make-up department I am the supervisior. I work from nine in the morning until five at night. My husband gets home at six and so I have time to cook his dinner We have a nurse who comes in and looks after the baby.
      Of a weekend we useally go out to some kind of sport Sometimes we go and see Mum and Dad but they useally come and see us. When we go on holiday they come with us too. We have got a yacth. Dad isnt to keen on it but we all beg him to come
      We like to go to the zoo or places where there are animals and we let the baby Stroke them and get used to them When she gets older we plan to buy her a pony and get ourselves a horse. 
      We live in a flat in the heart of London but we also have a small cottage in the country We are going to live there when our children get older and leave home*. But that is a long time yet.  Words: 228
