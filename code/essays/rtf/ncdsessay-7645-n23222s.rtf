When I am 25 years old I hope to be studying at a college to be a macanic at a firm or a Garage. When I am 25 I hope to be married and have a home of my own I would most like likley have a flat and later on in life I would try to by a house out in the country not to far from a town or city. I should hope to work from Monday to Friday as I would like to play football or some sport for a team at week ends. I would move down to [city], if I did not get a job at as a macanic and work for a firm I would work for a ship yard, as an Engineer.  Words: 129
