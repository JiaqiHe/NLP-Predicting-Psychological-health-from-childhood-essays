When I am 25 I hope to be a housewife and I hope to have two children only two because more would be much to cope with. If I do have two children I would call them, Andy and pandy. I hope to have a very big house with a very very big garden for the children to play in. If I did have a very big garden I will be very striked about it I will try and kept it very tidy NOT bit of paper laying around the path. And if I get a very big house I will try and kepp it tidy I wount a very big bedrom with lovely wallpaper and a big bed for my husband and I to sleep in (if I get a husband.) When the children are 6 to 10 the will be going to bed a 7 O clock to half past 8 NO LATER.  Words: 155
