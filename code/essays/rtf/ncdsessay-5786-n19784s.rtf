I live in house no 29 [street name] Oxford. I get up and have a quick breakfast and go of to University, in [street name]. I am a sociologist, and at the moment I am interviewing students. In, the afternoon I have a lecture to give. At home I listen to records and check the book I have written. I like listening to classical records and orchestra. I don't really spend much time at home but often I invite my friends over. Sometimes I go out to a concert in the evening. I am married to a man in the university. We usually do our work together at home but he won't go to concets, he has done once or twice but he didn't like it, its not the music but the people he dosn't like. I like playing the piano and I used to want to be a concert pianist but I havent got the time. Sometimes my parent come to stay with me. My sister is an archeaologist, she stays with me often as I have a house quite near some archealogical sites My brother is what he always wanted to be a conductor he never stays with us, I havent seen him since he was 18, exept once I saw him conducting but he didnt see me. 
At the moment I want to move nearer our university but my husband won't go just yet he says that we have really only just settled in.  Words: 247
