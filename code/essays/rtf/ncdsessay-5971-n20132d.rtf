I am now an air-hostess and am enjoying it I have no husband or children.. I wear a navy blue uniform. I am bassed at London and I live in a flat not far from the air-port as a child I learnt french and now I can speake it fluently. I can speake German too. I have no worries and I am paid well. In my spare time I go out with friends, that is it I have no work to do at home. I have been an air-hostess for five years and I have been to France, Germany, Canada and New Zealand. An air-hostess is a hard job and you have to do all sorts of things. You have to run up and down for passengers. Asking them if they want anything to eat or drink, and telling them to fasten their seat belts and telling them not to somke and to wind their watch on or back. I have got to get on a plane to the U.S.A.  Words: 170
