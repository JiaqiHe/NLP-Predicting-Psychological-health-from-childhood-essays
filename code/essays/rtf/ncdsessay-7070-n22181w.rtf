When I am 25 years old I hope to play Football on Saturday any other sport. My job would be Enginearning or Electronics. I would try to be helpful in any way posible*. I would not be on dogs or horses only do the football polls which I do not think is betting. I would try to make friend with people I would also like to travle to other Contries and learn their ways of living. And maybe go on a Sirfari or an Exploraction of an unknow place. Or* go down to the deeps of the sea in a submarean. Taking fish from difrent dephs and seeing if they were diffrent in any way. Or quite diffrent go up in a space rocket and land on a planet many* miles from the earth. But if I lead an ordanry life I will try not to lose my temper or be cruel to animals or people. I will do exercises in the morning to try and keep fit strong and healthy. I would liston to people people how were explaing things. And try to understand and remember what they were saying if I did not undersand I would ask if he would repete it. I would try to do well in tests games or comerptions try tiil it was overthise* thing would do try to do anyway.  Words: 227
