I would like to Bread Horses as I am very fond of them. I would start a riding school in the country. And I would get a house and settle down. and if I were rich enough I would have swimming baths, tennis courts ect. If I were to breat horses I would have fifty ponys and sixty nine horses I would also have a simmer house at Filey in Yorkshire. I would get married and have four children two girls and two boys I would not like to have twins as I could never tell the differance. I would also like to be a Lawyer But most of all I want to bread horses. It would be so much fun getting up early in the morning and Grooming the horses. I would also like to own a small farm and have a few pigs, cows sheep, hens, ducks, And I would own a Vegatable farm to I would grow Peas, Carrots, tomatoes, colliflowers, lettuces, turnips, patatoes and things like that. Each morning I would get up feed all the animals and get freshly laid eggs for breakfast. I would have to have a few hundred acres of land. After I had had my breakfast I would go along to the riding School and teach the children how to ride. Then after my busy day I would go hom and read the paper then go to bed and wait for the next day to come and do the usual ru**an. On Satuardays and Sundays we would clean out all the sheds where the animals were kept and then go for a picnic. On Sunday morning we would go to Church and then come home and have a nice roast chicken.  Words: 290
