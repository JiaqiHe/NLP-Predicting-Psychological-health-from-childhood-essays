When I was twenty five years old I had been in the police force five years as I had decided to become a police man five years before I decided to become a police man. I new it was a dangerous Job sometimes I am up all night on duty, mainly when I go home I Just sleep i am that tired but when Im not tired I make big models of ships this I like doing very much as nobody gets in my way as I am a bachelor, living in a very nice cottage in [county] in the town of [town] wich is not far from [town] the police station is four miles from my cottage and I cycle their from home. I am a cuntable my beat is now because it has been changed going past a new houseing estate wich has only Just been arrected and familys are moving in to fully furnished houses with back gardens and a small front garden the chief thought this new gang of burgalers that had been raiding the district might try to raid this new housing estate that had Just been arrected Some youths had already broken some of the side windows but when questiond they denied it and we have been keeping a close eye on them ever since. I am in the police cadets football team this is my other hobby.  Words: 234
