I am now twenty five and it is the beggining of a new day. I am a student teacher at a college near London. I share a room with my friend [female name] who also wants to become a teacher. I already have seven O levels two A levels and a G.C.E. In my spare time I write letters to a girl who has been my pen-friend since we were eleven. We have seen each other in nearly all the holidays. Next year I start teaching in a junior school called '[school name] Primary School' I sometimes work in a Jewish School. 
My hair is long now and I am married to someone called [male name] [surname]. He is in Chelsea football team. Sometimes we go to the pictures. On wednesday evening we attend night classes [male name] goes to study enginneering and I go to study teaching at the moment I am top of the class, I also have received another O level I had a letter telling me so in the post only this morning. My mum sends me Five pounds a week, and I give [female name] two pounds for my share of the rent. I also give her another one pound ten shilings towards the food. As my husband is away at the moment I am sharing with [female name] but soon I will be moving into my own flat. I must be going now or I will be late goodbye.  Words: 245
