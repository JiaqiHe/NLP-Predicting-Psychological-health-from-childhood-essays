I work as a partime teacher in London at a big school. I live in a large house on the outskirts of London. I have two children one aged three and on aged four. Every Tuesday I catch a train into London I leave my children with my friend. I get home at half past four collect the children and go home to make tea for my husband. My husband works in a large factory. Every evening I put the children to bed and I start my sewing. I like doing sewing.
Somtimes in the weekend we have a picnic. On wet weekends we stay at home and I do oil paintings. Sometimes on Tuesday evenings I bring books home to mark.  Words: 121
