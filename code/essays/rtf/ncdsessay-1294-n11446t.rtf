At 25 I hope to be in the R.A.F. piloting either Hawker Harriers or Long range maritine patrol aircraft My interests will be the same as they are now My home life, on leave, will be rather short but in this time I will be visiting my mother and father. I might visit my sister if I have enough time. As I have asma flying may not be possible and if this happens I would like to join the R.A.F. police working with dogs.  Words: 84
