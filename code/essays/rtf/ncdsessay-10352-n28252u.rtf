One day we were looking around when we saw a coat shop it had beautiful fur coat in the window, I said, ""Oh It's gorgeous."" [name] said ""Do you want it?"" I said yes. So he went into the shop and bought it for me I walked to the car with it on then I asked how much it cost and he said fourty four guiness. I said goodness where did you get the money from? He said I have been saving my money for a month. My husband bought my children a lot of things for Easter"  Words: 172
