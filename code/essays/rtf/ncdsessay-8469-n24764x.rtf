I am a RAF pilot flying a English Electric at [airbase] and I like my job. I would hope to have a sports car also I would hope to have is a wife. My job would interest me a great deal because I am intersted in aircraft at the moment. If I don't do that job I would like to be an engineir for a garge. This job would also interest me because I like fiddling with engines and models. The only troble is that I might not like these job when I am 25 years old. If I do get this bob it would be near* [town]* because I would hope to live in [town]. in a flat that I had bought from the consil. I would furnish my flat with all the modern furniture I would traval to work in a big red sports car. At the weekend I would take my wife either to a rally cross race or a ride in the country*.
