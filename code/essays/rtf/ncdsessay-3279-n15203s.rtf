I would not mind being a tennis chapion. and go nearly all over the world playing tennis against other chapions. I would like to get married and have a baby girl and boy. I would like to marry a man who is not rich and poor, and that he has good mannars. I would sometimes go out and play with my children when they grow a bit older and teach them how to play tennis. If I did not have to play tennis I would go and work outside somewhere, like Woolworths. I would be leading a good life and help my mother and father when they wanted me to help them. I would go to them about three times aweek My husband would go out to work all the week except on saturday afternoons and one Sunday. I would like to work in Woolworths because my sister mite be there, and I would like to work in boats. I would go over and see my sister sometimes and take my children to see for children. I would decorate the house when the old wallpaper was getting out of fasion. I would make my children dolls clothes or their own clothes if they wanted any. I would do the cooking and be friendly with my nieghbours. I would take a *art or *ie up to my mother and my father I would do all the house work and I would would do some gardening with my husband and help him all I could*. If I and to move from some where to i* somewhere else I would. I would see *o I don't want to. I might have to more b*****e I was a tennis player*.  Words: 286
