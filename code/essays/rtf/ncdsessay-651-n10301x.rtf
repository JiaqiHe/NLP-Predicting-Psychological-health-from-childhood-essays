I am just over twenty five years of age and am a needlework teacher at [school name] Secondary School. I work hard teaching all the girls who attend that school how to make dresses, how to bake, cook, english and foriegn dishes and many other small jobs they will have to do as a housewife.
I enjoy dox teaching these things. I have been teaching at this school a year. It is the first school I have taught at, as I have been to college and university since I left school.
To become a needlework teacher I had to take many examinations, like the G.C.E. I was quite nervous when I sat my first exam, but passed them with ease and was very thankful when they were all over. 
I am not yet married but I have a boyfriend, and we are hoping to get married sometime next year. We met at the Ice Rink when I accidentally skated into him. I enjoy skating but unfortunately I am not able to visit the Ice rink very often.
In the evenings I usually sew or knit I make most of my own clothes and enjoy doing it.  Words: 193
