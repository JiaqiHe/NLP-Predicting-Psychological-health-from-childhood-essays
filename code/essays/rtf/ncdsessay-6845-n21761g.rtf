I work at a factory where they make cars, it is called [factory] Every morning I would come from my home in the country-side, I have a M.G. G.T. which I go to work in. At work I was the car tester, I had to measure how long a engine would run non-stop on a test bench. I also drive them round a high speed track. For doing these Jobs I have good wages and I also enjoy doing these Jobs. I also have a 650 cc. motar bike which I like because of the fresh air rushing past my head. My house is a bungalow where I live with my friends [name] and [name]. We have a pet dog called Russ, he is an Alsation and he is very big. He has quite an appitite aswell, he somtimes comes in the car with us for a ride. We have a small plane with is kept in a small hanger in a feild just opisate our home. Russ hardly ever misses a trip in the plane, when we are in the sky he sits down and never gets in the way of the person controling the plane.  Words: 197
