I am hoping to go in the Royal Navy and some day I hope to have a ship of my own. I shall have a house of my own in (town). I would like to have a car. I do not want to get married. I am leading a good life and I hope I have a good life at twenty-five. I also like the school I'm at very much. I like painting and drawing. My interests will be painting and drawing. I will be an artist for a couple of years.  Words: 92
