My life at home is not so hard, I have not a lot of things to do. I have* more things to do up stairs, and to wash the windows and to change the beds. I have to send the, children to school and go shopping, at home I would have to wash the cups and all the other things as well. I have to keep the house clean, incase I have some friends coming round. I would have feed my pets and take the dogs out for walks. I am tired* and I sometimes go to sleep. When the children come home I have to make there tea and let them watch television and I will wash them and take them to bed.  Words: 124
