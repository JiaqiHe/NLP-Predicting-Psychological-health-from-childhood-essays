My intrests are model making reading and studying games and painting and drawing. My homelife would be digging the garden making improvements round the house watching television and growing vegetables. I would be an engineer or a welder. I would weld pipes and cars together. Or I would mend engines and make different sorts of engines. I would discover things about engines. I would find and Improve parts on the engine. I would try and make cars cheaper to run. I would make tyres last longer. I would make them last longer by asking the tyre industrys to use thicker and better rubber. I would try to make engines smaller. I'd make the cars safer. I would make the cars so that they had better steering.  Words: 126
