I am a scientist working on rocket research at ****. The work is very interesting and I am working on a long distance ground to air missile for message carrying and bombs. I live in a nice country house which is quite big and has three bedrooms. I have a wife and three children who say that they will try to get a job in **** when they are old enough. My fellow researchers are a nice bunch of characters and are always friendly. Mr Jones who is my assistant works an the fuel systems of the rocket. My friends work on things like the P.R.3.Q.1. My daughter is 5 and my two sons who are twins are 19 years old. The distance from my house to **** is twenty one and a half miles so I have to start early. I am a member of the helicopter club and also of the radar amatures society of Britain. The principle of my rocket is that when the atomic substance* that my assistant is developing exploded the exhaust gasses shoot out and propell the rocket forwords at a million miles per day. My wife is a good cook and when I get home at night i sit* and enjoy a really good meal. The wages that I recieve are very high and I earn xxxx20,000 a year. The twins own a department store in **** which does a very good trade altogether we are a very happy family.  Words: 247
