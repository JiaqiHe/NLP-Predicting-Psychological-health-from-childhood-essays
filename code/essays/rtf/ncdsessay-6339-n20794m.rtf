At twenty five I was living in a flat with one bedroom, a sitting room and a kitchen. When I bought it there was a small area of neglected land at the back and a bit at the side. Being a solicitor I was quite well of for a bachelor so I employed a builder to establish a small but adequate garage to house my Moms 1100. I got up every day at about 7.40 and cooked my breakfast, At about 8.45 I drove my car out of the garage and went to my office. I dealt with a client who was buying a house in the morning and then I went home to have dinner. After dinner I studied the afternoons work and at 1 45 I set off again. I was standing in court that afternoon so I took a law book to read. After the court case I decided that I would have tea out so I went to a cafe and fed myself. I then came home and looked over the next days work. Then I did the house work and then I finished off a cupboard. As the court case had finished early it was now only six so I changed into my gardening clothes and went out to weed the garden. At about 8'o'clock I came in and did a bit of sewing and I also darned my socks. Later I read and had some supper. At about 10.30 I went to bed after a hard days work.  Words: 254
