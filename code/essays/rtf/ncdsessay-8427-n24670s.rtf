"The next day was my birthday I am now 25 years old and my name is [name]. Even though I was a bit old to be excited for birthdays I couldnt help it. That very next day I went to work even though it was my birthday I work with my mum at a job called Tesco's it is a very big store to work in but all the same I enjoy it. When I got home that night I had my tea and my father said, ""Many happy returns on your birthday"", and with that he brought from under the table a very small box I was very curious but when I opened it I was overcome with joy and surprise for there in the little box was a beutiful watch I put it on it was very beutiful. After a few months it was my mums birthday I wondered what to buy at last I found something to buy for her I was going to buy her a new pot of her favourite flowers they are called Gerameims which she simply loves and a new green flowery dress but when I gave them to her I could see at once that she loved the flowers the best. One day on Sunday it was my day off work so I went to the park with my sister who is a year and five months younger than me when we got there I sat down on a bench thinking how much I loved family hoping that we would never part. After a while my sister and I walked all the way around the park then we bused it home. When we got home we had our tea and I decided to have an early night so after washing up the tea dishes I went to bed only to dream what a sweet and warm-hearted family I had got and I thought to myself how lucky I was to have such a happy and wonderful family like this. and that is the story of my wonderful life and home."
