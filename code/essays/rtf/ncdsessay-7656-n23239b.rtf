I am now twenty five years old. I have just left university. I am going to get married. I would like to have a far*a as I live animals very much. If I can't live on a farm I would like be a mother and live in London. I might get a job, I don't know. If I lived on a farm I would like to have an old house as I think they look very pretty. I am very fond of animals so I think I would enjoy being a farmer's wife. Of course, I would have a lot of work like, looking after the diary and the hens, but I would not mind. I would like to have a few children as children make the house look very homely. When they are babies and are crawling about or todling they make the house look jolly and happy. It gives you a nice feeling. I was thinking of haveing two children and if I am lucky I would like a girl and boy. If not I would not mind two girls but I do not think I would like two boys. They make two much noise. If I did not have a farm I would not mind living in London. London is different from the coutnry it has a lot of cars and the country does not In the country you can find flowers and pretty dress but in London or any big town you can not. In big towns you would not get a big house, you would have a small house with practiculy no garden. If I had the choose of a house in london or a house or farm in the country I would chose a house or farm in the country.  Words: 296
