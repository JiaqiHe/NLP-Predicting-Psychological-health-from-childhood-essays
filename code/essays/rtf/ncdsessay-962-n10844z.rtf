Now I am 25 I am still a batular but I hope to get maried soon. My job is an electrition and I'm still living in the town I was born in. I live with my mother but it wont be long before I by a house. I will of course still viset mother some times, and keep in touch with the family. The good thing about being an electition is that if you have a power failer or the t.v. might have gone wrong you can put it right wothout getting an electric shoke or having to thump the t.v. so hard it falls to peices. I have taken up stamp collecting an enjoy it as a of work hoby. Foot ball is still a game I find fantastic and I still support manchester U. And as I'm 25 I'll go to all those Dracular films which are x films.  Words: 151
