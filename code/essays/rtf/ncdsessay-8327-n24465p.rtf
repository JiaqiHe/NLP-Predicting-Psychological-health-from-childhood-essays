I am very happy in my home, I live with my three children and my husband in a little bungalow up in the blue mountains in Astrailia. Every day my husband goes out to work and I tidy the house, I then take the children to school. there ages are 6,7, and 8 then I go off to work, I am a Make-up artist and I enjoy my work very much because I meet very interesting people at four o'clock I go home and collect the children then I make supper and my husband comes home from work. Sometimes we all go to the sea-side and enjoy our-selves. My life is very happy.  Words: 113
