----------------------
I am leading a straight and enjoyable life, my intrest is entertaining children with music and puppet plays. I am living, alone in my own house. My main work is with a cartoon film company, next year I hope to marry someone somewhere. Life at home is all right, but Im away working most of the day. Cartoon making is enjoyable and one film takes a long time to be made.
If parents go out and want their children out of the way I would be very glad to entertain them so that dont feel left out of their family.
I shall visit my parents very frequently and give them gifts on special occations.
My enjoyable life shall go on for ever and I shall not get bored of doing these things.  Words: 129
