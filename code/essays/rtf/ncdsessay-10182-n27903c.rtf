I am now 25 and living in London, that is if I am not away in some other land. You see I am air-hostess and already I have been to Rome, Italy, France, Germany and Switzerland. In the years to come I hope to have been to a few more countries. When I am staying in London I like to go sight-seeing. The history of London is fasinating to me and I enjoy very much visiting the historical places of this large city. Apart from sight-seeing I also enjoy reading, skating and playing my guitar. Being away quite a lot makes it difficult to see my parents although I try to get to see them as much as possible. In London I make the most of my short holidays by shopping and visiting my relations. As my parents live in [village] I have to go by train to see them. I used to go riding but now I don't do it so much. My friend is a vet and I like going to her surgery as I am very fond of animals. Although I live in London I prefer country life to that of city life as the city is inclined to get busy and it makes you feel rather trapped. I am interested in stamps because I had a fine collection when I was young. I enjoy my work very much and think I lead a very good life.  Words: 240
