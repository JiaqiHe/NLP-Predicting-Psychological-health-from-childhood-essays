----------------------
I'm mostly outdoors working in fields or on the farm. Poughing, sowing, haymaking, harvesting cleaning out sheds and feeding dairy cows take's up most of the time but I can have days off when my brother will do all the work and the other way arround. I'm never bored because theirs alway's something to do. I have a bungalow but not married. I don't drink or smoke.  Words: 67
