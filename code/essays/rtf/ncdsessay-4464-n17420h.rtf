I am leading quite a nice life at the moment I am not married I have no children. I go to work and I have been going since I was 16 1/2 years old I go five and a 1/2 days to work a week I get up at 6 O' clock each morning and do a bit of work then I leave my house at quarter past seven because I have to get to work at half past seven. When I come home I get something to eat then I tidy up the house and go to see my mother by the time I get there it is about half past seven becaise I leave work at 6 O' clock then by the time I get home and have had something to eat and tidied up and caught the bus it is about half past seven, when I come back from by mothers it is about 9 O' clock then I put the kettle on and make a cup of coffee and go to bed On Sundays I go to my mothers to stay then I go home about 7 O' clock because I have to go to work at quarter past seven. f I am ill I have to go to the doctors and have the day off I try and get better as quickly as I can then go back to work.
