My name is **** I am 25 years old. I am living in a bungolow. I am leading a pleasent life. I have a lot of housework to do. It is the dog that makes the most mess. At the moment I am a part time nurse. I now live in Luton but I am thinking of emergrating to Germany. My bungolow is rather small. It is called The Nest. I go to work in the morning and some home at dinner time. While I am away my neighbour **** looks after the dog. I have a car. I am going on driving lessens I take these leasons in my car. In my spare time I do needelwork. But sometimes I read books. I belong to the **** libary. Were I live we do not have rauch sunrise because there is a tall factory blocking the sunlight. At the momet I am reading a book on nursing. If I have the chance I will become a scholl teacher. I will teach night soholle*. The times will be from about 7 o'clock till 9 o'clock.  Words: 184
