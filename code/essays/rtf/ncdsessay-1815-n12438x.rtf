"At the moment I am on a mission on an Island in the Pacific Ocean doing under water exploring for rocks diffrent kinds of seaweed and fishes Yesterday* when I went exploring with my mate [name], we found baby octapus and some rock that if you touched it would crumble, so we had to take bits of it. Also we were almost trapped by a landslide but we just managed to swim to saftey Today we hope to explore right under the Island which by the way is uninhabited In a couple of weeks I will be going to my Mother. ""Better get the boat ready. [name]"", I said, ""Which part of the Island are we exploring to day"". ""I, think we will drop anchor on the south side"". Next Day: Hey [name] we got some good things yesterday yes we sure did. Espeically that queer fish all those blue striped one's Hey [name], yes [name], a telegram for you from England. Bad news, yes my Nan has just died and my Mather wants me to go home for the funrel she's booked a seat on the first plane tomorrow. Give us your address and we will call in when we come home. I had better go and pack. Next day: See you [name] see you [name]. In London it was a lovely day and my Mother was there to meet me. It was a sad occasion for all the family. I have never seen so many people at a funrel."  Words: 251
