At the age of twenty five I am now a happy contented man working as a helicopter polit for men in the oil b**sness I go to far off countrys like south America to help build or carry bits of machines to the Jungle because boats can,t reach the places for the rivers are to short. 
      When I am on leave I go to stay with my farther and mother who live in [district] (thats in [city]) where I stay for a few weeks untill my holiday has finshed I have my own home but my mother is some times worried about the life I lead in dangerous countrys so she arsked if I would like to stay with her a few weeks and of couse* I cannot refuse.
      My really interest is* football and when ever I have the chance I sink into a chiar to and watch Grand stand which has been on the air for the last 15 years.
I go to dance halls and play tennis with my friends.
      But sometimes when I go on a job It takes six to 8 months or even a year. But even when I have helped out in the building of the tower I will still carry men so that they can carry on with the job. An like my job and I would never swop it for any thing mianly because its exiting.  Words: 235
