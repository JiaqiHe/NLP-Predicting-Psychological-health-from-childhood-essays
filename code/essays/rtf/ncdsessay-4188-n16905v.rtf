In the mornings I stay at home and do the washing for my husband anc children. At twelve o'clock I get the dinner for my husband and I, because my children stay to school dinners.
In the afternoon I go to work. I'm a secratery for a sheet metal worker, like giving the men their tea in the afternoon break, and writing letters to our customers.
I usualy do this every day. I enjoy my life a lot. At 4 o'clock I come home,  because my children come home then.
When my children are in bed of a night I stay up and do some neelde work I most of children's clothes. And I knit them socks and woolies. When my children grow up that they will get a good job and make use of their spare time.
I also want to send my three children to university.  Words: 144
