My interests in my life is making things buy hands . Iam making cuboards, chairs, models etc. My home is that I want a girl and boy to look aft*ter and bread birds when Ive got no work to do in weekends or any other holidays. And my family grow up so that they will be able to be married like me. My work will be making things out of wood and metl. I will play the horn in band. I will have a big house with lots of things in the garden a pond, flowers and vegteble a crockery, and have a car to drive. When I retire of the job I would keep on with the bre*ding of birds thats part of what my life is .  Words: 129
