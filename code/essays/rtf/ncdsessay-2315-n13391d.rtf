The job I do is a mechanic for [company name] I go to work on a motorbike but I am saving up for a sportscar probably a lotus Elan, if I can afford it. The money what I earn is enough to keep my flat heated and to buy enough food to keep me alive and also save up for a car and a house
One of my pastimes is motor bike trials the motor bike is a 250 cc. Greenes*. The bike I go to work on is a 650 cc Norton. When I get the car I intend to sell the Norton Keep up the Trials riding. But might get a bigger bike and go in for Scrambling. My Mum and Dad live in [village] and I go and see the twice a week and sometimes they come and see me.  Words: 142
