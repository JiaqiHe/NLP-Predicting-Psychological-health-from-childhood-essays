I am twenty five years old I have joined the army and I am a fully trained soldier I am leading a good life in the army I have interests like football drawing painting. and when I get leave I would go home I would help cook the dinners and oither jobs around the house ******* could ask for action to be transfered to Aden I would go to Aden because there is a lot of action in those parts I could be exchanged for another young man who has not seen proper fighting so he would* not be scared he could take my good place in a office at desk work while I fight.
