I was married at the age of twenty one my wifes name is (name) who workes at the nursery in (place) my son (name) is 3 months old who is at the nursery where my wife works. my house is quite nice now considering I papered and painted it myself. I have a car it is a Morris 1100 and does well in summer when i go away on far distances. I find me and my family very nice and my job it is boring once in a while but I soon get over it. I quarel and shout but soon relaxe with a shandy or a lemonade drink. I like being twenty five at least I dont get told off all the while by parents, and tallmented by brothers and sisters . I ride down to the house and see my mother and father and sometimes take them out . I get two weeks holiday in easter, four weekes in summer, and two weeks holiday at christmas. Some times I have to do painting shops or sighn writing on factories. I would sooner be back at school and work.  Words: 219
