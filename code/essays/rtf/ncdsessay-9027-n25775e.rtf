I am married and have two children. I work at teaching children to swim in my spare time. My husband worksat G.P.O My children both go to piano lessons, as I go and have won many cups and certificates. I enjoy playing the piano very much. I also teach children to learn the piano as a full time job. I have a very busy life what with feed the children and feeding their animals and also doing the housework I get quite worn out. 
     I don't like cleaning out the children mice very much. They have to mice which are both very friendly, They run in and out of your pockets and go up the sleves of your jackets.
     My childrens names are Jane and Paul. They are very lucky, I think because they have two mice, a dog a bird and a goldfish. and now they are talking about having a cat. But I say to them they can'ot have one because it will chase the mice, catch the goldfish and bird and then the dog will chase it and then it will run away. 
     I also go with my husband to play golf on the crazy golf course. We go on Wednesday evenings and get the next door neighbour to babysit. We have a very good time playing gold. 
     I am thinking of giving up teaching swimming and I will then work as a playground lady at an infant school, because I like young children very much. Jane and Paul go to an infant school so then I could look after them as well as the other children.  Words: 273
