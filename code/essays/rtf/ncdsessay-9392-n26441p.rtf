I am jsut getting up, the time is 9.35. I switch on the automatic tea maker and I have a nice 'cuppa'. After that I get dressed. I read the newspaper, then I get in my hovercraft and go to work. I am a teacher. I work at one of the few 'old fashioned' schools where the teacher teaches. Todays lesson is History. We are writing about the world, 15 years ago. I tell the class that the countries prime minister was Mr wilson, how he was displaced by Mr Heath in 1970 and how in 1973 the rival parties joined together to make a united goverment. Britains entry into the common market was an interesting subject. So was the prison systemn. Now the prisoners work their way out. What I mean, a prisoner is sentenced to a certain amount of work. in 1969 a prisoner was sent to prison for an amount of time. Football was the same then as it is now. In 1969 a team was awareded two points for a win, one for a draw and nil for a loose. Now you get a point for every goal.
My hobbies are meteorite collecting, (these fall very frequently in England), and coin collecting. Our home has the new inflatable beds and the 'home computer'. Also we have the 'A.S.S.7' Burgalar Alarm MkII. This alarm rings a bell and drops a net on the criminal.  Words: 236
