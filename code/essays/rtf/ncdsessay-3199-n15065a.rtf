At twenty five years old I will most likely go to work either in a fruit shop or a factory. If I worked in a fruit shop I would have to know what change to give. And if I worked in a factory I would have to know how to work the machine. I would like to have a baby if I was married then. At home I would have to do quite alot of work. And at night times I would rest. Then if I couldn't get a job like in a fruit shop or factory. I would get a part time job like helping in a school kitchen. I would live in a flat or a bungalow. Because I wouldn't like a big house. And I would like to work at an airport in an office. My hobby would be perhaps swimming and ice skating, and I would like needlework and stamp collecting. I would sometimes go out to the pictures if I could. I would have two children twins which will be two girls. They would be named (name) and (name). They would be fair haired or dark haired. That will be my life when I'm twenty five.  Words: 201
