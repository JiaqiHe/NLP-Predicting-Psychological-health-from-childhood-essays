I am 25 and I am having a very interesting life I love animals and I often go for walks and study animals, bird, and insects, I love watching animals grow up my work is studying animals bird and insects and writing books about them so that every one can now about them. I keep insects. And I watch animals and insects change. At home I have all sort of animals fish birds insect to watch And I take notes on them every day I have some lambs to bottle feed when they grow bigger they will eat the same as there parents And I will let them into a field where they can run around I have a dog And I feed that too. Yesterday I saw a buterflye lay eggs And now Ive let it go.
I am trying to find how many different colour on all the birds and which has the most. I live in a house a long way a way from any one eles so that the noise of the animals cant bother any one. I like finding difrent homes of animals like the rabbit borrow the haire and gox I looked after a starling and a thrush I have a avery and Ive got all sorts of birds in it I have a minor bird and it can talk it says Helo good by How do you do good After noon.
