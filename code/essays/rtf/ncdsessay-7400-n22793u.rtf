As I am now 25 years old I go to work. I am a school teacher which is quite interesting. At home I sometimes watch television because I take part in after school activities. I am married and have a child so I spend plenty of time with her: taking them out amusing them etc... My main interest is music, but I have less and less time to hear music or play the piano at home. I teach in a junior school which has been my ambition ever since I was a child. I wanted to be a teacher because I thought it was interesting and I have found out that it is.  Words: 113
