I would live on a farm I think looking after the animal's and alway's have plenty to do. I think would get married and have a famaly but not to young. I would like a nice big farm house with not too much garden. Horse's cows, and sheep I would like on the farm but no poultry. I think I will most likly have a small riding school for the ponies. Idoubt weather I shall do my swimming as much as I do now although I shall go now and then. I would like to live the country but only a five* mile's from a village. I would like to do as a job a swimming coach part time that is. I mite even work for my dad as a secatery as I some now but no on the type-writer. I would not have too many clother's just a few realy nice one's.  Words: 153
