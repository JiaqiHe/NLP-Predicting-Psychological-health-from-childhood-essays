I am now working for English Electric and I am director of engine fitting for British Railways, the trains are much different from what they were in 1969 when I used to train spot, they are driven by rockets instead of the old diesel engine now. I live in Derby near the works, Derby is a very big city now, even bigger than London, there is talk about it becoming the Captial City. Men are working on building a huge bridge across the English Channel because the was a small leak in the tunnel. I have a small speed boat and enjoy going out on it at holidays and when I have the odd day off. Some times I go to scrap yards to see if there are any diesel engines left that I have not got. I am not married but I lead a happy life with out one!  Words: 150
