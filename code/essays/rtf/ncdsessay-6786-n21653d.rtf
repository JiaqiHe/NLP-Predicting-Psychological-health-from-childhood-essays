I am 25 years of age and I am a secretary, I am not yet married, I have a beautifull home and a lovely car. At the weekends I go out to clubs, and sometimes I stay in and watch television. Where I live is in Wiltshire near Bath, I sometimes go to Bristol or Bath in a coach to look at the scenery. When I am married I am thinking of leaving my Job of being a secretary and have another job some where closer because the other one is in Divises and its to far to go. The number of our house is 58 [street name] Rd. I am thinking of being a typist and work in a office, I finish work about half past five and go strait home for dinner. My kitchen is blue, with wood on the wall, and bath Room is also blue. My father Put seats in the kitchen to sit on and also put the wood on the wall. The colour of the car is mustard and matches with the curtains. Our car is a Woldley 6/1100. I have a cat and god their names are Dinkey and Peter.  Words: 197
