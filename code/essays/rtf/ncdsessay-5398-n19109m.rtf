"I am 25 today and my husband brought some flowers and chocolates home after work. I had a very tiring day at the theatre where I work, rehearsing for the evening performance of Coppelia in which I play Swanilda one of the leading roles. I got home that evening I went straight to bed with a drink of Coca and an asprin and when I woke up the next morning I felt much better. After having my breakfast I washed up and set out to clean the windows, but then it started pouring down with rain so I had to dash in and find some thing else to do, then I remembered my husband was still in bed ""oh goodness"", he will be late for work"", so I dashed up the stairs and woke him up he greeted me with a snort and to my relief he said he had a day off from work because he had to go to the dentist. Then a knock at the door I opened it and there stood Mrs [surname] our next door neighbour, I've got something for you she said, and pulled out a gorgeous black and white kitten. ""for me,"" I said ""how lovely. Mrs [surname] said she was in a hurry so she left me standing there holding the kitten, I wonder what I should call it, Mrs [surname] said it was a she ah I know Samantha would be nice yes I'll call you Samantha. I went up stairs and told [male name] my husband, He siad it would give me some one to look after now and it did because she turned out to be a little rascal but very affectionate*."  Words: 283
