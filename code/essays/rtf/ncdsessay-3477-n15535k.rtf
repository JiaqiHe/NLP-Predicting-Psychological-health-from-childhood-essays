I am a teacher and enjoy it very much. Sometimes the children are very naughty and I have to tell them off. I live in a flat in London by myself and visit my parents every Sunday. Nearly every Saturday afternoon I go swimming because I like it very much. Other wise I go for a ride in my car. Yesterday I took my class to see the Tower of London, British museum and sience museum. They were very good we got back at 6 o`clock. After wards I went straight home and had my tea then I watched television and corrected work from school. The next day was a Saturday so I stayed in and stuck stamps in my stamps Album. After dinner I watched Television. On Sunday I remembered that I was on holiday. So I thought I would on a camping holiday for a week. I started out on Monday at 8 o`clock in the morning. I decided to camp in the New Forest. I got there at dinner time and put my tent up. and had dinner. when I went to bed that night I went straight to sleep. But about 4 o` clock in the morning I woke up and found that the tent was on top of me. In the night a horse had pushed the tent down so I had to put it up again. I went back to London on the Friday night.  Words: 241
