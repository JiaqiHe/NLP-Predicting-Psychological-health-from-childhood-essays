"I am at collage learning to be a teacher, and why I want to be a teacher is because I love children, and I like the way they talk, Play, and odd things which know one would think of normaly. And every day I come home and make my brother's and sister's tea. Then after tea they would all go out to friends or clubs. But I have to stay at home because I have to do all my home work, and when I have finished I would watch T.V. then go for my yongest brother at his pals next door the we would both go to the fish shop for a patty and chips then go home after that we would go to bed. The next morning is Saterday and I go shopping in the town and after I finished all my shopping I ran afeter the bus but is was to late. Any as I was a bit fauther on my bascket split in half and all the food went all over the pavment and a man came and helped me pick them up and ""he said I will help you home with them"" and I said thank you, then we both caught the bus home, then he said what is your name so I said [name] and he said [name] then we got engaged the we got married then we had children, but I gave teaching up"  Words: 240
