"My Name is [male name] and I am Chef in the [restaurant name] Resturant. Just now I am making a steak Pie garneshed with Brandy. A Chef was what I always wanted to be and now I am one. I started last week from my Apprentaceship. The managers name is Mr [surname] he is nice but everything you bake has got to be perfect for him. When you show him a burnt Pie he will say ""cant you cook"". By the way I am 25 today and I wanted to be a chef since I was 10 I hope I am going to like it."  Words: 105
