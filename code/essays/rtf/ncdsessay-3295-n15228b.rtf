I would lead a happy life. Enjoy my work and work hard. It would be a nice JOB like working in an office. It would be a job where I could have Saterday and Sunday off. I would still go for long walks go and see horses and animals if I where married then I would not go to work I would have some children 2 is enough. Keep the house clean and tidy try and do some in the garden. I would like a cotage and a big garden, plenty of flowers and a little stream and water fall. I would go out with my husband and children, Tuesday night, Thursday night, and saterday afternoon and Sunday Afternoon. I would have animals for my Children and a cocker Spanil for the house I would have it while it is a puppy and train it to behave itself. I might have a pony for myself or my children. I would be in subjection to my husband and we would have a car to go to places we would go to the sea-side and go place's together I would not marry a man who drinks smokes swears and gambles. look after anyone in my family if ill go and see my mother quite often and would make my clothes and my childrens clothes I my child is born an inverlid I would care for him or her and treat him or her like my other children.
