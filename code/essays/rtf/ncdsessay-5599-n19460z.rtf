I am married with one child, a boy, and I have a job as an enginer which brings in enough wage to keep us in a large detached house. We have not long been moved into this house soIam generally getting sorted out and Iam putting up shelves and baying carpets and doing things of that sort. For a Honeymoon I visited America andwehad a wonderful time touring the states for three  weeks. At weekends I often go out with my family to admire the country we live in or else i would stay at home and read the news paper and do jobs about the house****, of which I like doing as i work hard and I enjoy my spare time  Words: 122
