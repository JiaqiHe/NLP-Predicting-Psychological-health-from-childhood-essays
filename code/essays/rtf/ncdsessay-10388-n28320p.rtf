I have a quiet interesting job, I am an architect . It is really a quite interesting job, at the moment I am making an old house into as modern a house as I possibly can. I am grawing abroad next year with another group of architects to see the style of hourses they have in America this should be quite interesting really this job takes you out and about and I think that is what makes it interesting In my spare time at nights when I finish my work I wold maybe watch television or play a game of cards. On a Saturday afternoon I go to the football match if there is one or else watch the telvision . In the summertime I go fishing rain or shine but I like to go best when it is raining because the fish can't see you and you catch more In the future I am ** haping to emigrate to canada for a better job out there I like making things out of wood such as carving boats out and giving and painting them some ***** I **** I put a radio controlled engine into them I do the same thing with aeraplanes and some cars that I also put mators too  Words: 212
