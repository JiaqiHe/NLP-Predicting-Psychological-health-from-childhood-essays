When I grow up to be 25 years old I want to work at a zoo or any other places were there are animals pond life, & birds. I shall try to buy  a house with a big garden, so that I can look after animals. And I will try and live next to a river with fish in it. And I will own a motor-bike or a car. I hope to go on a trip on Safari. And when I have my spare time after working at a zoo I hop to work on a farm. I shall not drink or smoke, becaus it is bad for you. I will have many pets. And I shall go out with my frends. I do not no wheather to get married or not. And if I get a moter-bike it has to be a big heavy norton. I shall have three dogs sheep-dog, Alsasion and a bulldog.
