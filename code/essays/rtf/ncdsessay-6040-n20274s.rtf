I am in a nursing home (hospital) I would have finished my training and I would probably be married. i would like to be married (or engaged) to a slim man with golden hair. I would live in at the hospital. I like reading and geoghraphy as well as watching television & listening to the radio. On my nights off am going to go to dinner or go to the pictures. If I never lived in a hospital I would find a flat or my mother would let me live at home. On afternoons off I do some cooking or house-work; or go shopping and by my-self new clothes or if it is someone's birthday I would be buying presents.  Words: 120
