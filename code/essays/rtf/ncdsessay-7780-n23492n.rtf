"I am twenty five years of age. I am a Veterinary Surgeon I enjoy my job very much and I have my own surgery. I get all kinds of grumbels from people about their pets, for instnace the other day a lady came i nand said ""Oh dear my pet dog wont eat anything at all"" but really it was a case of overfeeding the dog. I am vey interested in sport expecially swimming, I also enjoy hiking. Every year my husand and I go hiking in [village], Darbyshire and the Lake District. I also am a part time tailoress. In fact I make nearly all my clothes. I have been very sad this week because a burgalar broke into our house and stole a pearl necelase. The other day my three year old daughter had chicken-pox and I was very worried because she was-not very strong when she was born. When I reach the age of 30 years old I am planning to finish my job and to settle down to being a housewife. I am planniing to take up cake decorating and make very nice cakes. Any way I will have to be going now because I will have to be packing for my holiday in Spain."  Words: 209
