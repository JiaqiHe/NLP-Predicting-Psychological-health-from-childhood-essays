I am twenty five years old, my work is a cemist I usaly work five days of the week. I have a rover car which I drive into work. The cemist shop is a small shop where I develop films. At my home I do the gardening, and I am growing a good crop of tomatoes in my green house. My interests are fishing, down buy the bridge, once I caught a 20 lbed pike.
I am hopeing to get a new lorn-mower because the old one's moter had bernt out. The house is a two bed-roomed house with a garage. I am advertising my house in the lacal paper, I have had a few people visting my house but now one has bought it yet. The house that I might buy has a bigger garden front and back.  Words: 138
