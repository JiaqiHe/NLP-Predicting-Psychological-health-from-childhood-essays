I livein a bungallow in old [town] on estate I have one dog a bitch named pippa she is a cocker spaniel. I am a spinster I play the bassoon in an orchester i allso teach singing lessons and I have played at [catherdral name] cathedral. near to my bungallow is the forest and I take pippa my dog a walk every night there. I have always liked old [town] because it is very peacful and you never ever can smell the rexco which is terible. I was an only child and I loved dogs so my mummy and daddy bought me one, I would never stop having dogs because they are so friendly and faithfully. I am planning to go to France then to holland and then to Italy I will be takeing my dog with me because I could never part with her. Before I taught sinigng lessons I was a short hand typist at mansfield. New [town] has changed since I was a girl there are more shops and the old building have been knocked down. like the [school name] Junior school. People of old [town] are very nice and helpful..
The [church name] church is still there and the clock still looks and chimes the same way it used to 14 years ago.  Words: 216
