The life I would like to lead is to have a good job not out in the cold picking up paper. Id like to save all my money for holidays going out with my wife to a club have some drinks not to much because if I am driving home I would not like to have an accident and just sitting doing nothing in hospital reading cant get up to go out in the sunshine. But if all this didn`t happen I could be at home with my wife sitting at the fire or when its a good day we would go a run out in the countryside to see our cousins and live there for a few weeks to enjoy myself. One evening when we were alone she said she was going to have a baby and I was so happy for her the of course I would have to work double shift to earn more money to buy clothe likes of anarks hats jackets pockeys ad more of all nappies for the baby. When she got her baby it was a girl and we got new furniture for the house. And the baby had about xxxx2 in her bank from our cousins uncles auntys and her father .
My intrests was on the baby I cared for her she was bathed every night was in her bed at 7o'clock on the dot and she got her dinner her tea and supper she got her bottle and rice  Words: 248
