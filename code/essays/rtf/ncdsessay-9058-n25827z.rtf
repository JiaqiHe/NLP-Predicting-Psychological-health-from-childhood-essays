I had just arrived home from the science laborotory in the University. I was living in a flat with my husband. We had been married four months and were living in the suburbs of ****. I had been in the University since I was seventeen and was studying about diseases of people and experiment with animals. Also I was a lecturer and talked about my studies to younger students. My husband also worked in the University as a dental surgeon. We hoped to have two children a boy and a girl but we would have to move to a bigger house as out flat is small. There isn't much housework to be done but I like to make my own dresses and clothes. and it usually is cheaper that way. After a few years or so I will leave my job and settle down into an ordinary life and look after my children. I wouldn't like to move from out district because I would miss the excitement and my friends.  Words: 170
