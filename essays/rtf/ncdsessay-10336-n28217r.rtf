"At the age of 25 I am a married woman and I have two children. They are twins and go to school. I enjoy reading* and watching television. While my children are at school I go to the hospital from nine till half three. Sometimes I go on night shift. I do not work Saturdays or Sundays. On Saturday after lunch the family will go fishing. On Sundays maybe a picnic.
On day at the hospital I was told that I had to change my job and go round people's houses and tend to them there. That meant I had to have a car. The only thing that really bothered me was that I couldnt drive.
When I had passed my test I started my job. It was very exciting really I enjoyed it very much talking to old people, young people as well. My children didnt really like me doing this job for if I was'nt home they would have to make their own tea. When they were 11 year's old they passed their eleven plus and went to ""[school name] Grammar School"" which was in [town]*. They liked their school very much indeed. It was then that I decided to stay at home instead of working. Sometimes I took them to school. When I was 30 I had another babie, a boy. My daughter want to be teachers when they go to college. I hope they are happy just like I was."  Words: 242
