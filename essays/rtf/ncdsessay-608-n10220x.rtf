I am now a business manager, working at W.H. Smiths, [town] My hours of working are 9. AM - 6 PM. weekdays. 9.30 PM. until 1 o'clock Then I drive home through the town to my house in the town of [town] It's a 15 minute drive. When I arrive I put my car in the garage and walkinside. In the winter my wife normally has a bowl of soup handy to warm me up. I then sit down in the lounge with my feet up. 
I switch on the television to find Spotlight South West on talking about the gold increans of Fort Knox. I turn it over and much to my disgust I find Coronation street is on the opposite side. I switch of the television and read a book. 
About this time my son comes home from school He had just had extra work at school. It was Latin Extra work today. and he didn't like Latin, and was thoroughly bored he switched on the televion and did exactly what I did I went up to bed and sat read The Count of Monte Christo. After about half an hour I heard the downstairs clock ringing 7o'clock and I snuggle down and fall asleep. My wife came up to find me rocking and rolling. She woke me up and told me what I was doing and got into bed with me.  Words: 234
