to Now I am 25 years old I would like to start proper astronomy. I would like to live in a big house in the country so that my work would not be obsructed. I would like to have a lot of money in my bank account for astronomy is an expensive job. My money or pay would come from the Government if I can get a job as a proffesional astronomer. My home life would not be a very busy life as I would live in the country. My job would not gain a large amount of money as there is not much working in the job. In the country there would be less to do than in the town so my interests would be very small.  Words: 128
