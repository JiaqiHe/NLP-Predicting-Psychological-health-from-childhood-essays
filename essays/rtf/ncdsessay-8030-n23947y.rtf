I'm at work. I work as a telephonist and receptionist. I have a home no family and I live with my friend. I have no idea to get married and have children. I wake up at 8 o'clock in the morning and get to work at 9.30am. I get home from work at 6o'clock and have a dinner after that I either stay in with my friend or go out as far as I can to get away from the same old place (my home).
When I go on holiday I go with some of my friends also not married. We go all over the world. This year we are going to Holland. Last year we went to Switzerland. Well I'm still at work and I've just hot to put somebody through. I like living with my friend it is interestin. I wanted to be an air hostess, but then I thought I liked being a telephonist best. I have get a very enjoyable live and I'm glad I am not better.  Words: 171
