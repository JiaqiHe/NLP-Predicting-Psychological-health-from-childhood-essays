"I woke up one morning to find the crisp frost on the grass and the morning sun just rising about the clouds. ""Yes"" I said to my self it is going to be nice today. I went down stairs and got dressed. Soon I left for work. I am working in a school. I am a games mistress. As I was taking the 4th year today and we were going to play rounders. At home in the week ends I look for interesting places were I can take my class. Some weeks we go to museums and other weeks we go on picnics. I am very interested in pond life. I am interested in ponys as well because I often give a hand at the stables where I live. As tommer is Thursday I am taking my class to [museum] musem. These are things I am really interested in."
