My job is a pilot and I have to go to the airport at about 7 oclock every morning so I will not miss the flight. Nowdays airoplanes are things of the past. I do not pilot a plane I pilot rocket. At home my hobbie is painting. I sometimes help at home and sometimes I go to london to look at some of the new jets. When I go home I start to pack my pilot kit into a box. Now there are now wars and nobody ever fights. There are no such things as cars and lorrys. Nowdays jet powered veciles speed along the highway and people are used to the noise of jet rockets, People live in domes and if you go outside you would die within an hour  Words: 132
