I am a busnasman. I own a building site and I own a car factory. My interests are birds of other countrys and my own future of my life. My work is hard, designing new cars and houses. My life is troublsome sometimes* because of the many strikes I have in my factory. I am married and I have four children. I design three types of cars they are the Fords, Zephr and Singers. It is a very interesting life and I hope it will be when I get older. Besides my car factory I have my building site which is making my life easier in ways. I make good money for both my jobs. I am more relaxed at work than I am at home. I have one personal intrest at home and that is birds. I have an avery down my back garden. I have many more kinds of birds. For intance the humming bird, Zebra finch, Java Sparrows, I have also got some of Britains rare birds like the, Goldfinch, Jay, Hawfinch, Long tailed titmouse. It is a very amusing life for me. I have also got two snakes. They are both common boa's. I have brought five new designs out in my factory and many more to come. I hope its going to be a great success as a busnasman.  Words: 224
