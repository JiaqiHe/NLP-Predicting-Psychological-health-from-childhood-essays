I would like to live a simple life and not so boring. I would be married by twenty five. I would like to be a hairdresser. I would like to have two children one boy and one girl. So then I would like to have a house out in the country with a garden on a field. I would like to go to America so I can see many sights which I have only seen on the television or in newspapers. I would like to have a car. So went my mother and father are old I would take them out. I would like my husband to be a piolet so he may talk about where he has been what sort of poeple were on the plane. One time maybe we will with him and look down and see what is below. Or I would like to be an airhostess and go to many countrys and learn many lanuages. I could marry another man from another country and learn to speak his lanuage and he can learn my lanuage. We could do many things together and let our children go and have a good education. We would travel alot and trie to save up for a caravan and live in that.  Words: 211
