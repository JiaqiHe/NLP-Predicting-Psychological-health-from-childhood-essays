I am now 25 and I am in ** R. A. F. I do not fly airliners, as I joined, it became very exciting and as the years pasted I learned how to fly.
If you join the R. A. F. you don't get as much pay as you would flying airliner's, for if you fly airliner's you get millions of pound a year.
I joined the R. A. F as an ordinary boy, following my fathers footsteps, as he fought in the war , flying bombers.
When i joined all that I had read in books came true, now I play basketball, fencing and water sking. after I have learned about under water *wimming and last week we visited a wreck. Once I got leave for 2 month, and went to (place) to see the divers and was invited to have a go. I took this up and at 65 feet plunged in, I banged my arm on the bottom and although bruised, I was okay. Sometimes when i get a nights leave, me and the boys go to the cinema after tea at a chinese restraunt, with a british waiter. We often get excercises for bomb aming an gun practice. We have to get up in the morning at * get dressed out for inspection and then for breakfast made diffrent by woky, sour milk and porridge. Our base is in (place) and some time ago I went to (place) the airforce coll-ege. Sometimes I visit my family in (place) and spend about a week with them before going back ***** or somwhere else depending on how much leave I have. So th**** what lifes like in the R.A.F.
