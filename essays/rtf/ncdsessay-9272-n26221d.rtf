When I am twenty five I would like to have a job where you get a lot of money for easy work I'd have two children and a medium size house with three bedrooms and a large garden next to a forest and near a school I would go fishing on saterday morning and tehm watch football on the television, if I were near a football ground I would go there instead. my best team would probably be manchester city and Leeds. in the afternoon I would do the odd jobs at home and in the garden I would like curry on sunday at dinner time. I would like to ve a scout master up at the scouts hall. 
      If I could I would like to be a newspaper journalist and go to lot of countrys to interview people when I am a bit older I would probably go to another job.  Words: 153
