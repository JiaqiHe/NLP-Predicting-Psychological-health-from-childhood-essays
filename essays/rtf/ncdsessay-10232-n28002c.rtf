Well I would have left school, and I would have a job. I would like some of these jobs a chairman of a big firm. or an acting job. let us imagine I've got a job and move around* alot. I would like to have two or three cars maybe a lotus and a Rolls and something else.
As for a house I would like to have a big old house right out in the county, with a nice big garden. I would like to have a family, two boys amd two girls. I don't know what schools will be like in 15 years so I don't know about schooling for the children. The job I thick I would like best would be a actor and move around and see new places, and then if I get good enought. I would love to go on TV. For an interest I would like to watch races and have a small plane and when we went on holidays, I would like to drive the plane. (I would like to be well off) Coming back to actting, I am not shire what kind of plays I would like to be in.  Words: 197
