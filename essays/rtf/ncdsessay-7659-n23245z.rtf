I live quite a healthy life and meet quite a lot of people and animals being a vetenairy surgen. I have two girls to help me one to help with surgury, and one to prepare the instuments for the operations. Or do some clipping. I live in a big house so I can have a surgary ther for the Hampden P***hers can come instead of going into [town].

I have one boy and one girl. I like to have a rest about a fortnight a year and get a locome to replace me last time I had sombody called [male name] [surname]* a south African. I have 2 cats called Della* and Wong*.

I like to do a bit of handy-mans work. I have a cortina 68 model with a 1300 engine. You see I need a pretty big car to get cat baskets in and three or four dogs in.
I often get a fierce* dog in a we have to tie its mouth together to carry on with what we were doing. Or a cat we just hold it back and front legs together.  Words: 183
