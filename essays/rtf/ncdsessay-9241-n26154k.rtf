One of my other interests is football, I have bea* a keen westham supporter the most of my life My freind and I have often visited my home a* **** Essex. My sister is a nurse and she comes home every now and then* to look after my mum and dad. I have already served with the navel air force on aircraft carries* and have trained some greenhor* for clock* landings severel time* they cra**** that nonw was killed. Weve traveled to many overseas countries. Before I was at the squadron I was town forget dro*** up and down because black g*****s wanted to practice. and I was but by a small bit of shropral from a gunner off target.  Words: 200
