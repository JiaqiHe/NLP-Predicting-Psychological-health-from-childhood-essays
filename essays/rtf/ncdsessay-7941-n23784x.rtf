I am now an Air Hostess. I go to work about once every week. I enjoy the work very much and I like meeting people and also looking around the citys and countrys where I land. The work is not easy, but very hard. I enjoyed the trainiing very much. The uniform is very smart and I live in a flat with my friend and we keep in tidy. We take it in turns to keep it clean, when we are at home.
      I drive my own car, but sometimes I go by bus, or walk if it is a nice day.
      I took up this job because I like meeting people, and I have always wanted to travel  Words: 119
