I am now in the Navy the food is good and the ship is large. I have a house in [town] in Dorset I picked this place because I am interested in shipping and yachts. There is a large lage near by which on one side is a power station opposite that there is the poole model yacht sailing club which I have joined their pool is boarded off the large lake by a cat walk on stilts the whole thin is dissconnected from the sea by a railway embankment in the middle of the embankment there is a sluise gate which controles the water level. A road goes round the lake which a tunnel goes under the road onthe other side there is a lake with ducks and swans in. My house is near the Beehive hotel. I have some freinds in the Navy and am stationd at Gosport as a draughtsman. At the moment I am designing a steel that will withstand an armour piercing shell for a new ship which is being built. The house has a gold fish pond with a fountain. and water lilies in. It once had a green house but is now a summer house.  Words: 202
