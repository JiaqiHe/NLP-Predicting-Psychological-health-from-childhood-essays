When I am 25 yrs old I want to become a police man in (place) and help to fight crime. I dont want to get married I think I want to be a bachelor because girls are always being so**y. I will learn to cook for myself so that i dont have to have a woman to cook for for me. When I am 25 I will learn to drive a car then I will buy a Vauxall Velox as it is my favorite car in style and shape

As I have learnt how to do a few things on my dads car I will know how to do my own car when i am grown up and have my own car.
I will be able to drive all over the country in my Vauxall car. I will buy some polish for my car and keep it in the best contition I can.  Words: 151
