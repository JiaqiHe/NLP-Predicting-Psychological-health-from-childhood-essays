I am now twenty five, I had my birthday a few days ago, I am off to play golf, yesterday I won my friend in the whole round. I am hoping to win again today. I have had three weeks holiday, so I am off to France tomorrow to see all the exciting things. I going on a boat there, and on an aeroplane on the way back, So I am going to have a nice holiday. Anyway I have arrived at the golf ground, and now am going for hole six. I have finished my golf, and I did not win, but I am going fishing this afternoon with another of my friends. I am going into the house and dinner is ready, Oh boy, its chicken and chips my favorite dinner. I am now on my pudding, its ice-cream, another of my favorites. I have finished my dinner, and am now getting my fishing gear ready. Its all done, so I am now off in the car, my friend is driving so I can relax and admire the scenery. We got there and started to fish, first my friend caught a big one, and then I caught a couple of small ones. We did not get any luck after and soon it got late, so we went and my friend droped me off at my house, I had my tea and then I watched television until about eleven a'clock, and then I went to bed and drempt about the lovely day I would have tomorrow. But time soon flys and I will have to go back to the police force, when I come home from my holiday, and will have to do my serjants exam.  Words: 287
