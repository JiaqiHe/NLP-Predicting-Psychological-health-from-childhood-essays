About the age of 25 I would think of undertaking a job, my job would probably a Doctor. I would be thinking of marrage. I would be saving up to buy a house and a car. My interests would be of many things like racing cars, motor boats. At the age of 25 I would be studying all the time. for the exam which Doctors have to take before getting permission to practise on people. The life which I would be leading at that time would probably be a hard and difficult life and I would be staying up late studying. I would not smoke or drink and stay up to late or go to too many parties. My future wife would be kind, affectionett and loving. My home life would be quite relaxing (apart from the studying) and I would also be kind like my wife, and reading and watching television perhaps and alltogether leading quite a nice life. I would of course be hoping to succesful in my future career and earn sufficient money, not too much and not too poor either but just enough to keep us going. I would hope too have three daughters, all averagely brainy. I would like also be able to play the piano.  Words: 211
