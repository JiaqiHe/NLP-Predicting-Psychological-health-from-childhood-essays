----------------------
after I left school I would try and get a job. I would like to get married at about nineteen or twenty. I think I would like a small family I think. I wouldent mind living with my best friend [female name]. I then think I would like a easy job with quite good wages in it.
Another thing that I would like was to be a good housewife. Because I like looking after very small children and talking them out for walks.
If I had a family I think I wuld like a girl then another girl and then a boy. I like children very much.
Sometimes I might evern go to the cinema or go for walks. I like singing but I dont like singeing in publisity at all. I would like very much to have a car all my myself. Maybe a Sports car with the inichals of seven seven oh one 8. The couloure I think would be red with a black pull up roof. 
It would be very nice to go on a areplain trip to Itally or somwehere it would be very nice  Words: 186
