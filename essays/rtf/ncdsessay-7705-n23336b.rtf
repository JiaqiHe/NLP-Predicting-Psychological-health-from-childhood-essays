If I was 25 I would live in the country in a little cottage. I would be engaged to a man. I would get married at 26. I would not go to work as I think a womens place is in the house We could take the baby to the loch Katrine and sail in a boat. My husband would be a football player. I think my hobey would still be reading. I read lots of books when I was ten and eleven. I still have my favourite book whitch is All Because of Gina. My husbands hobey is football. He has lots of pictures of Rangers, Celtic, Scotland and England. He thinks that Goege Best and Colin Stein are both good footballers. He first started football at the age of 12. He has been in a lot of teams. Each year we visit Parkhead and Ibrox. We met Jock Stein and Davey White. My son is in Sandwood football team.  Words: 161
