I would try to study a lot, or go to university or college. If not take up a job or hobby. Try to find a boyfriend if I have not one. Go to clubs and meet people. Go and seerelations. Visit very intresting places such as museums. Look up things. If I had not a boyfriend I would still live with my parents untill the age of 26 years old. I would always be doing some thing, If it was a hot day I would go strolling around the park or doing odd jobs. Try to help people as much as possible. If I could get a job of helping at a school or a deaf and dumb school I would try to get it. I like helping children who cannot do things for themself. Children who Can't walk or children who are born not very well. I would also like a job as a nurse or doctor. If I could get to college I would try to study as a teacher. Especially in an infant class, I would also like to help my own parents as much as possible after all they have done for me.  Words: 197
