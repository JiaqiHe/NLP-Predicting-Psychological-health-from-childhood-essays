"I would leave my flat and go to my surgery, put on my white vets coat and help the vet, as I am apprenticing to be a vet. I would wacth him operate on the animals and give him the insrements.
I have done some operations on the animals, one on a dog, a cat and gave an injection to a hamster. The operation on the dog was to get out a sixpence which it had swollowed and it took gwite a while doing it. The operation on the cat was to get a thron out of its foot. 
On the hamster I had to put it to sleep even thow I didn't want to, Because that is killing it, this had to be done because it was ran over by a bus after excaping from its cagde. 
One day the vet was ill and I had to take chrage of the surgerey, and I had rather a triering day and after work I had to fill in bills and pay my rent. I also had to note what work I did to tell the vet when he gets back. He was away for 2 weeks and I had to keep on working and notcing the things that I did. It last he came back and was very pleased with my work and sent a report to the R.S.P.C.A. and told them what I had done and wrote back saying ""that I have now passed the test and can become a vet"" I was very please and soon became a vet."
