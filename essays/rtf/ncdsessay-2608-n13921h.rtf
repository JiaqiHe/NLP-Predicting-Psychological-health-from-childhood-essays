Last week I was 25 years old I have been leading a good life. I work in a shop. The shop sells nearly everything. It is a chemist The only things we don't sell is groceries. I like going home from work on sunny days and having a salad for my dinner. Then going out on the viranda to sun bathe. Sometimes I go visiting to see my aunts. Sometimes I go to pictures, dances. Some nights I stay in and to the house-work if my husband is working late. Sometimes I take the children down the [local park] Park if it is a nice night. It is a bit boaring going down the park every night your self so I ask my friend if she is coming down with the children. On a wednesday It is a half shut day so I do the washing. But if it is raining I go to my mothers. She lives in [district]. I usualy stay their till the night for the children is only two and four. The like their gran because she buys them a lot of sweets.
