The date is the [day] of [month] 1983 it is my birthday I live in detroit U.S.A. my parents are coming over to America this afternoon but this morning I have decided to go out and do the things that I am intersted in . I have joined the golf club in Detroit and so I though I would have a go at all 36 holes. this is my best interest. My second interest is the History of motor cars and Detroit is the best place I know to look up all the Veteran and Vintage cars. I have located a musiem that I have not yet had a visit to and so I have decided to spend the rest of the morning looking round it. 
When I got home I was greeted by my wife who had cooked a dinner which was already on the table. My house was not very big it was a semi detatched house but I found it just a good as any other. it had three bedroom a bathroom, loung hall, kitchen and basment but we had more nessescitees than luxeries.
Every morning I go to work in the middle of town its a small firm, my job is to design cars this I think is a very interesting job, My wage packet is very good xxxx50 a week but my only day off is on a Sunday each week. I come home at half past six in the evening when a evening meal is waiting for me.  Words: 253
