When I am twenty five I will be at work in an office and I would be leading a steady life. I would have a flat somewhere in [city]. My intrests would be making models. My days routine would be 8 o'clock get up and get ready for work and then go and cook my breakfast and then go off to work. The journey to my work takes about fiveteen minutes. Work starts at nine thirty and it finishes at five thirty. I have an hour and a half lunch in which I go to a bar for something to eat and drink. I have to be back at two thirty. At five-thirty I start to get ready to come home. When I get home I start to get my dinner ready and Its usually ready about quarter to seven. At about seven thirty I would go out to meet my girl friend at a bar and we would have a few drinks and some thing to eat we also danced. I went home with her and a just before she went indoors we had a kiss. Then I started to walk home. It was about twelve thirty before I got home and so I went straight to bed. About a month later I asked my girl friend If she would marry me. It had taken alot of courage to ask her and she said yes. About six weeks later we got married It took place at [church] in [city]. We went on a honymoon to France aftter a very big reseption. When we came back we stayed on living at my flat for a while and then we went to live somewhere in south-east [city]. I still earnied on the same work though.  Words: 294
