I have just left home for work. At the office it is like an ordinary day I have 3 hours for lunch after my lunch I go to the libary then back to work. After I leave I go to a football club until 10 o'clock on daturday mornings I do some shopping in the afternoon I play in a football match my interests in the evening are adding to my stamp colletion or reading. On some week-ends I go swiming in races against other people. In the summer some of my friends and me go climbing we tack with us some scouts and one are two adventure scouts. I am a troop leader on wensday evenings 7 o'clock to 9,30 pm. In my spare time I go conoeing in Norwich or around the coast. My home life is just the same as the other homes.  Words: 146
