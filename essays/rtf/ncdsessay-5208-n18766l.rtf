"The year is 1983 I am 25 years' old I live in Wales in a small bungalow off the Ronda Valley. In 1969 I became interested in batteries and bulbs I rigged up bells, electro magnets and all sorts of switches and am now an electrical engineer. I have a luxury building in Cardiff. and do a good bussniss because cars are run by electricity. I became rich in 1970 when I found a 1918 penny in my pocket, I got xxxx5,000 for it from a London dealer. My sister is married to a film star named ""Mickey Joe*"". She lives in a dump called ""Southall"". In my spare time I make hover bikes. The local station is made out of very hard plastic and monorails fly fast at 2000 mph. Jumbo jets streak a-cross the sky. Along the kerbs there are five feet high railings to stop children dashing onto the road. There are no zebra crossing there are subways instead. It's a very funny world these days. It's all new decimal coinage. There was a 4 penny peice out in 1979 it was square with a hole in the middle. Those were the days oooh! it brings the tears to my eyes the 1/2 d oooh! dearie me how time flys. There is going to be a new ship built bigger than the Titanic even. Its a wonderful world. Today the world is wonderful but we take all these things for granted."  Words: 244
