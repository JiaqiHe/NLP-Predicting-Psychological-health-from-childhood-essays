I am now training to be a doctor. One day I hope to be a famous one. My interests are playing tennis and watching television. I am singel, now and I don't intend to get married. I live by myself and hire a woman to do my cleaning up. I study quite a bit for my exams. I lead an ordinary life like anyone else. I have a couple of* years training to do before I become a qualified doctor I hope I will pass all my exams fairly easily. I shall try to save all the money I earn as a doctor. I shall only spend what I have to. I will try again to pass my exams if the first time I fail. I wanted to be a doctor when I found out about the heart transplants. I thought it would be wonderful if I could do something like that. It is very hard work but I am going to go to the very end. I think I am doing well at the moment but I cannot be sure. I hope nothing happens to change what I want to be.  Words: 192
