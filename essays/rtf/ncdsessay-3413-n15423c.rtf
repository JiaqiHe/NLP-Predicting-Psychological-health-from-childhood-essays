----------------------
I would like to join an orchestra with my violin. After I leave school, I think I would like to go for a holiday, then take up a job, as a vet. because I like animals. In my spare time I would listen to music and play it, I think I would have driving lessons and drive a car before going into a job. If I don't get to be a Vet I shall do something with animals or biology. If someone else was at the same job as me I think I would have a flat with them. If not I would live in a house or bungalow and keep some animals. I would visit some of my old school. friends. If I had a choice of where I would go for my holiday I'd probaly go to France, down to Spain and into Portugal*. I might join a club of some sort. When **** I would go and live in a large house in* the * country but not too far away from a town where* I would work.  Words: 181
