"My three children are playing in the garden. ""[female name]"", ""come and have your tea""! A regular treat that they like is rice pudding with a blob of jam in it. I always eat my tea when my husband comes home at 6.45. [male name], stop behaving like a 2 year old. Your 5, now stop it!"" While their eating their tea I sit down and relax, perhaps I'll do my crocheting or read my magizine.
We live in a bungalow about 4 miles from town we usually go shopping in town on a Thursday. The bungalow is a big place and it is quiet a job to keep it clean.
I take [male name] and [female name] to school in the car. Then I take my husband to work and go home. Then there's little [female name] to sort out. She's 2 and a little terror. She's into everything and every one. The school is about 1/2 mile from our house so the children can't walk, its to far
I love going for long walks in the country, the children love it. We often go to the beach in summer, we live about 1/4 mile away so we go nearly every day.
I have a part time job on Wednesday afternoon in town. In a boutique and I'm an assistant, but I mostly make my own clothes and the girls but, I can't make trousers. I don't know why. I make [male name]'s shirts and I knit. I have my own knitting machine and I really kept busy, what with dress making, knitting, part time job, and crocheting, and a family to feed, I have my hands full!"  Words: 275
