"One morning I said to my mother ""I have decided to join my father's businiss"". This was how it all started, I started on Momday the next week and all of a sudden I was one of the staff in [COMPANY] ESTATE AGENTS AND SURVEYERS.
      I would spend from Monday to Friday in the office. The next thing I decided to do was to buy a fLat in [location]. I found a very pleasant one which had one bedroom, a bathroom, Kitchen and Lounge.
      I decided to continue collecting stamps as by now I had rather a good collection. I also bought a cine camera for I rembered my father taking pictures of my brother and I playing golf with plastic clubs.
      I would come home in the evening dog tired only to find that in the post was the Income Tax! But I soon wasn't feeling to bad because the next day a premium bond came to the value of xxxx25,000. At this I was very surprised for it had always been my favorite wish and now it had come true
      Then next week it was my 26 birthday."  Words: 190
