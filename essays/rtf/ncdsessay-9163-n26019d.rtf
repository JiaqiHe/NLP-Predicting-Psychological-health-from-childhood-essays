Next year I will be 26 years old. I wanted to get married at that age because my mother was married at that age. I work in a hairdresser's. When I was eleven years old I always said I wanted to be a hairdresser and I am one. When I was eleven I used to play with my little cousins hair. At home at nighttime I just tidyed the house for my mother sometimes I went out with my boyfriend. I like going to the dancing with him the pictures, the town, it is great fun because I love him but I dont know if he loves me. To-night I will ask him. I asked him and he said he did and we are getting engaged. He said if I still loved him by the 21st of December he would marry me. Our engagement still lasted it was getting nearer it was now 18th of December. I started getting everything ready for the wedding. I invited lots of people. The day came that I was getting married. I was ever so excited I had to do my hair but dont forget I am a hairdresser. I had my bride dress it was white and it was straight. ect [male name] and I were married the reception was at the place just up a few houses from [school name] School. The reception was over we went to Spain for our holidays. I had a baby after we were married a year. We lived a happy life. That is all I have to tell you.  Words: 263
