I have been to the university for two years and I am now a jet pilot in the R.A.F. I fly a lightning at (place). I get there by car every morning at 8 o'clock. It takes me 30 minutes to get there going at 30 miles per hour. When I was nineteen I had a lisence to fly a glider. When I was 24 I was training to be a Jet fighter Pilot and now I have made my ambitions I have been at the university for now over two years. Yesterday my engine in the lightning stopped when I was going at the speed of sound. I had run out of fuel. One of the big RA.F. fuel tankers was coming in to land at that moment but luckely it came up and refueled me. I am married but I have no children. My father own a farm and when I have holidays I come and help him on the farm. I once went trough the speed of sound over my Uncle (name) greenhouse and burst the glass in it I got a terrible row and had to pay for the glass,  Words: 194
