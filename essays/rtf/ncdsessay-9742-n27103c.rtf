I own my own hair dressing shop in (town) it is called (company) big letters. I have my own bedroom which is quite big. In the corner I have a bookshelf which has 30 books in. My bed has a lemon cover on with pillows to match. My wallpaper has lemon roses on with green leaves and white background. On my window shelf there is a pot plant. The news at the window are white with frills on the bottom. My green and white curtains reach to the ground. The wardrobe and dressing table are light brown. There are three other bedrooms in the house. We have a car garage. My shop has a lot of customers. I employ eight other hair dressers who are very nice. We have a back room which we have our coffee breaks at different times. There are five wash basins and five comfortable chairs. Also there are five double tables with mirrors on them. There are six hair dryers and six seats to siet in. The front of the shop is cut off from the rest. My assitant has a desk and telephone there with a book that has all the names and times of the appo--intments my customers have.  Words: 206
