I am now 25 years old, and I'm in the Army. At 15 years old I joined the Army. I joined the parachute corp. The life I am leading now is a good one and full of interesting things. When I was 11 I had read many books about the Army and immediatly wanted to join We learn unarmed combat, the use of mortars submachine guns, and moving up with armoured support. I have been in the Army ten years now and enjoy it very much. In the Army there are different sorts of corps there the Royal Artillery Corp, Royal Signals Corp, Royal Armoured Corp, Catering Corp, Royal Engineers, Parachute Corp, there are a few more corps, and I had a job picking which one I would be in. In the parachute corp you get to see the world, sometimes you go to places where it is a very hot climate. In some corps you get xxxx25 per week and paid holidays. At home I have a wife and child which I go to see every time I go on leave. The child is 2 years old and very lively. In the corp we go over assault courses and hack our way through thick undergrowth, and mincing in with it if any enemy guards come along, sometimes we attack them from behind and bring them down to the ground and then let them go as it is only a practice.
