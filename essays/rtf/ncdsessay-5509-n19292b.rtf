When i am twenty five i will be an engine driver. I do not want to get maried because i want to stay with my man and dad. I will buy a new car, and I will take my parient to the seaside or to a show and have a good laugh. And i will take them to the picture it could be a comady or something. I will go fishing and catch a lot of fish. I will go to Gool or newby hall, with my friends. My mam and my dad and me will have a lot of fun together. I would take my mam and my dad to London and we would see all the sites such as Buckingham palace and Travalgur* square and the houses of parler ment. And we will have a lot of good time and I think my mam and dad will engoy them selves very much in deed. My car would be a Rolls Royce and wher I ever I will take my mam and dad with me. We will all have a very good time in deed.  Words: 186
