When I am about I think I Shall try to be a cricketer Somwhere and try to make a name for myself. But iff that does not work out out alright I dont know what I'll do in the way of Sport, I might be a footballer or a teniss player and Iff those three do not work out. I might try electrical enginering or some one like Tony Blackburn who introduces record programes on the radio 1 programe. But I am not 25 and when I am I might want to be Somthing else.  Words: 95
