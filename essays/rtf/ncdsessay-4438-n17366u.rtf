I think I would like to be a pilot and be able to fly round the world, and do tricks in the air. I might also be a doctor and fly to my patieants in africa and other countries. And in my spare time go fishing with my father. And also in my spare time I would make clay heads and pottery and would start going out with girls and start thinking of marriege.  Words: 74
