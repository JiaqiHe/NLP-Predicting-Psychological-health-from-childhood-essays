"I am now twenty five. My work, is an actress. BBC London studios is where I work. I am now in a film called ""The White Feather.""
I am leading quite a doog life, I hope to go on like this.
I am interested in filming, and all backgrounds of Hollywood, and also gardening. 
I hardly have any time at home, but when I get the chance, I go home as quickly as I can.
When I do get home, I do as much gardening as I can, but I also help my mother in many ways. Sometimes I go out for long walks, early in the morning, or go out for the day, to the sea, or somewhere like that. I help my father by weeding the vegtable garden or washing the car. 
I usually go and see my brothers and sisters, but by then I have to go back to Hollywood."  Words: 150
