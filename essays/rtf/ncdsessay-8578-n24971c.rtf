I am 25 my home is small I go and have a game with the boys like who can kick a stone down the Street first. Then go swimming. At night go to work. At  11 o clock go and see my mom then go and see my brothers and sisters. doo some washing then have a ride on me bike round the sqaure 50 times. At 5 oclock on a thursday have peas potatoes cottage pie. At night go out to bingo. I work as a shop keeper I work their because I like selling things. I'd have chips and pies of a friday and saturday and cabbage and old potatoes and roast potatoes on a sunday dinner. And fruit on sunday night. When it is my birthaday I'll invite my neibours and ants and brothers and sisters. We will have shampain, and pop for the children.  Words: 148
