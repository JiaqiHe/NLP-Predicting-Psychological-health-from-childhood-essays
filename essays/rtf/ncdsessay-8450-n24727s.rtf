I write them myself I think they sound very exiciting. Some Adeventure help me thin*k up my own stories, but others get boring when you read them because you always here the same over and over again. The goldcre*t is sopposed to be the smallest bird in europe ,and the humming bird is the smallest in the world Another of my hobbies is swimming although I caonnot swim very far. My favourite bird is the blue tit * it is not very easy to reconize it is very much (v) like the Great tit but the only difference is the colours. In (place) where my hobby about nature started I saw rabbits run alongside the car* and then run into a bush the same thing happens to the hare , but the pheasents aren't scared about anything. They go over peoples gardens and you are not aloud to shoot them in the air, another law is you must not shoot hares on Sunday. there is even one for the deer if you shout deer you will get fine xxxx50. Another hobby I have is fresh water fishing although I am not very good at it. I have caught mainly goo***** (place) is the place for fish.  Words: 244
