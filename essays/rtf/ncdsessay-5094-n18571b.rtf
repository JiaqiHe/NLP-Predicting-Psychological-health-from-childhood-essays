My name is [male name]. My work at the age of 25 is not bad. Things go well at E.C.L.P's [town] works. I drive lorries or other machinary. The only part I do not work in is the clay dryer. plant. Later on, I hope to work at British Rail's [town] mainainance depot. My pay is not all that good, but I put up with it. My home life is a few hours at home then back to work. U usually have a fortnights holiday unless I am needed back at work. I enjoy a game of golf every now and then. The latest vehicle that I have driven is the A.E.G. Leyland eight wheeler. 
The farthest I have been is London, with a load of concrete blocks. I was diving was a Bedford t.k. On the way I touched seventy on the speedometer. At two o'clock I noticed that there was not much B.P. petrol left in the tank. I obtained 12 gallons at 6/2 1/2 a gallon. I delivered the blocks and went home again. When I arrived home I lernt that there had been a fire. The moment I returned to my house. I saw that it was burnt to the bottom of the foundation. I was raving mad.  Words: 212
