"Two months ago I Joined the army, & you get xxxx15 S12 D11 , JUST for trainning & going on parade. But the only thing that worries me is that we have got a very strick sargent. & hes got a lourd voice.
I first came to think of Joining was when I was reading Andy Cap in the dialy Mirror. on the page oposit, it said ""be a fighting man join the army"", fill in this coupon. The coupon looked like this > [picture of a coupon]. So I went to incier. They said ""you can join. Two days Later when I was at Camp. I was told to go in a hall I went in, there was long counter this was where I got my uniform & my pistol sub marchine gun, & dagger & rifle.
Well now I was use to it & settled down there as if it was my home. 
Then sudenley the siran went of we ran for the weapons*, & I lost some of my mates. When it was over & wared to our planes THE STAR FIGHTERS."  Words: 183
