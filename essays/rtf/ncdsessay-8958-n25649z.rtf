I was just going to work when I noticed what the time was. The time was a quarter past nine I new I was going to be late for work and the manager would be mad at me. I had to feed the lions and tigers today at the zoo. and the lions and tigers didn't like to be kept waiting. When I got too work the manager took two pounds away from my wages. I was'nt getting much money at that job thats why I never got married. I was quite pleased about not getting married because I could save a lot of money and go out a lot. There was one thing about not getting married I got lonely, thats why I had a lot of partys at my flat. I didnt smoke so I saved a lot of money that way. I liked animals thats why I was saving a lot of money to go on an expedition down the amazon river. Thats why I got a job at the zoo. I often go to see my brother and mum and dad. I like to keep keep fit thats why I joined a phsical training club.  Words: 199
