I work at the Westminster Bank like my Dad does, he now works at a branch in [London suburb] and I work at a branch in [London borough]. I drive myself to and from work in my own car which I learned to drive just before I started working at the bank, three years ago. I gave to be at the bank by 8.55 and get home at about 6 o'clock. I was married just under two years ago and my husband and I live in a pretty bungalow in [London suburb]. We had it painted pale blue and white and it looks very nice. In the garden at the front we have got a few lilac trees and lupins, peonies, and roses but at the back there are a lot of weeds all growing where they want to as we have no time to pull them up, I suppose I shall have to buy some weed-killer. Susie is the little cat we had given to us a few months ago, she is black with white paws and a white throat, but I am scared she might one day catch our pet hamster, Puffy Two, so I am very careful of him.
