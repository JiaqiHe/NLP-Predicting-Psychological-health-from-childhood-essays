I am 25 years of age and my job is a farmer, and it seems as if I am famos because I grow all wheat and peas and sugar beet. If I never grew these things some people would be with out bread and sugar. And with my weeks wages I would pay tax and rent and with the rest I would buy food for the rest of the week. I have to lead my life and do as I should. My interests of life is the blue and white flowers the blossom on the trees and the streams runnnig by. I plough the feilds and then cutlrate* it and drill it and then roll it so it is all fine and flat, and then I have to wait for it to grow it take at least 2 months to grow I get the combine havestar out and then cut the wheat or barley down. Later I put it in sacks and store it away in the barn so that it does not get wet. If the corn gets wet it will lose weight and will not get so much money for the sack of corn. At the end of the year lorries come and take the corn away to the market. And when the corn has gone we start all over again.  Words: 223
