Now I am twenty five I have a very busy life. Because I am an artist I spend most of my time accidently treading on oil paint tubes sqigging it all up my stockings. In the mornings I wake up early to clean up the mess waiting for me in the shop. I get a lot of customers really considering an artist is meant to be poor. At the moment I am painting a picture of an american fellow but by the time I finish, his king size cigar will have burnt itself out. Painting is just a hobby realy but it gets me in the mood for my fashion designs which realy count. I try to make up snazzy designs all buitifully expensive and In the evenings I am a model most of the outfits I wear are my own (I think thats the only reason I'm a model) and I love it when I wear the evening dresses. At home (my furnished luxury flat) I read, draw more fashions, watch my colour TV. and relax under a heat ray lamp (a common thing nowadays). When I have time off I love going to discottests to loosen my muscles under the lights after that I hook up a dreamy fell'a and get a date (I love doing that). The best part I feel is when im on my richly paid holiday and am stretched out under the scorching sun on the golden sands at hawia or some place like That.  Words: 251
