Now I am 25 I am going to get a gob. First of all I will be a footballer. Football is a good sport and you earn a lot of money. It helps you to keep fit and strong. I might be a golie. I am also going to be a rugby player. Rugby is sometimes rough. Before you come a rugby player you have to do a lot of training. There is one most important thing and that is being an artist. At school I do a lot of painting and at home too. I will do a lot of traveling too and do a lot of work in a factory. Because I am going to do some traveling is because the money you ern the better because with the money you can get a lot of gobs or a car Being in the army is a usfull gob because it will help the legs and arms. You can allso have good meals and it will help the poor because when you leave you will have a lot of money and some has to go to the poor. But when I am old I will be a manager or a doctor or a chemist. I might evan work for a shop or factory or do a gob on a farm  Words: 221
