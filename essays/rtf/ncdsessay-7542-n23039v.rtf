"I arrived home at nine o'clock, after after completing an operation on a mans digestive system, which had been very tiring. I parked my hover-craft in my gararge and walked in the front door, and smelt, Bacon and eggs! I thought, that's a bit out of date, still it's nice to have somting like that now and then. Just then my wife came in and spoilt my pleasent thoughts and said ""Go upstaires and get changed for super"". I said ""yes dear"". The next day was sunday, So I had to mow the lawn. Just as I finished. I thought I might go to America for the day. So I phoned up the airdrom. And asked them to get my jet fired up with floats. I asked my wife wheather she would like to come. ""she said yes""."  Words: 138
