I am now twenty five years old, and I think I am leading a very interesting life. In the next few pages I will try to tell you about my living, interests and my home life, and also my friends.
      I live in a house just inside [county]. The house is not very big as there is only myself and my girlfriend who is also twenty-five. Each day we leave our home at around 8.30. We have to leave this time because otherwise we would get caught in the traffic jam and would'nt get to our London work untill around 10.00. However if we leave our home about 8.30 we can reach our job at about 9.00. My friend and I do not work at the same place, but I only work a couple of streets away from her. My job is a secretary, and I do shorthand, dictation and take phone-calls. I work five days a week at about 8 hours every day, I can do over-time if I wanted, and get payed about xxxx18 a week, and every year I get a xxxx2 a week rise. 
      When I leave the office I drive round to where my friend works, and pick her up in the car and we drive home. 
When we reach home I put the dinner on while my friend lays the table. When the is ready, or still cooking, we carry on tidying up the place until the dinner is ready. When we have finished the dinner we wash up, and in our spare time we do pottery, baking and typing and reading. These are all things I can think of about my life  Words: 280
