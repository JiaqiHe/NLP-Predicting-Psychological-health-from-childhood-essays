I 'am twenty-five years old and I love Art, so I take my grant and go to Art-College in London. You do claying-modelling and colouring etc, and I would like to be an Artist. At home I take out paper and paints, also I usually colour. Clay-modelling is very hard to shape faces, and pottery has to be handled with care too. I go fridays maybe, or saturdays. I enjoy doing art very much and you must have patience, also a steady mind. Art is a lot to me because you can make mosaic's with pretty paper or material. When I come home from the college I do baskets of flowers or bowls of fruit and hand and feet too. I have a boyfriend whose name is [male name]. He likes Art, but not much. I meet him Wednesday's and Sundays to go to pictures and shows etc. David is a mechanic and a part timer like I'am. He would like to be a mechanic, but be a manager. Sooner or later I finish school and have six weeks off. In that spare time I stay at home and do work for Grandma. [male name] comes to visit me on Wednesdays to pick me up in his dad's car to visit his mum. For fun I usually ask mother to play piano because that is one of her hobbies. Mother plays old songs to bring back happy memorys. When my six-weeks have gone, I go back to college and tain to be an artist.  Words: 254
