Working at a garage is quite a hard job. Sometimes we have a rush when a lot of car's come in for petrol. But at other times it is very quiet. I get good wages for a job like this and I am busy nearly all the time although it is so quiet. I usually work on the pumps but sometimes I am called in to change a wheel or something like that. We give green * stamps and it is quite surpising how many we give away each day. Our garage is called (Name of place), and we sell Totall petrol. It is a all night garage as well but someone takes over my shift at night and until 9 o'clock in the morning. I am married and we have one baby child called (Name of person). My wife is called (name of person) and I like her very much. I am very interested in cars and this why I work at a garage. I hope when I grow older i will be in the A.A. I have a car like my father had once a (name of car). Of course the car has been changed because he had his car quite a time ago but it has the same name.  Words: 212
