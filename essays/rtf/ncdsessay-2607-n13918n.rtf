When I am 25 I am going to be a traindiver I don't know where I will be driving trains. If I am down at [town] I will try to get a game of football with the British legon club as a senter forward or a right wing I would only be a football player on saterday and sunday and in the holidays. About a train driver you have to risk other peoples life not only your own. When you are going fast in the night and there is a man on the track you have got to have good brakes and you must not be travling sick or you might crash  Words: 112
