I am twenty five I live in a bungelow with my mother I work at a shop and it is very interesting I like living in the bungelow because it is  much smarter than a house I have some sisters living with me and my mother I am very happy with the work I am doing and I am very happy at the bungelow I go to clubs and dances I am thinking of leaving the shop and being a dressmaker so I can make all sorts of things. I like the view from our bungelow it is very interesting the hills and all the other things that are there too. My Mother works at home she does not work in a shop or anything. I would like to go to London for my holidays so I will have to save up and then I will be able to go.  Words: 150
