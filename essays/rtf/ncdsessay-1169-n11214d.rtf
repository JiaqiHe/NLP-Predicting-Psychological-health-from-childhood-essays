----------------------
I am leading a working life in the factory in [town]. My Intrest are expanding greatly for I know like fishing, cycling, aswell as all my other hobbies. I am learning Biolgy now and find it very interesting to learn. I go out cycling a lot and also camping so that has to be kept clean, tidy and the bike well oiled
My parent think I shouldnt have left school at such an early age. The work I do is making wooden toys for children and I am a part-time fireman for [town].
I am an expert fisherman and I can take young boys to learn how to fish.  Words: 107
