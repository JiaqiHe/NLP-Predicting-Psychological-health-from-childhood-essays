I am 25 years old, and am a racing driver, I have had two crashes in my career, the first time I had a blow out, cart wheeled across the track and ended up with two broken wrists, The second one was a bit more Serious, I once again had a blow out, but steered into the next door Car, If it hadent been for my Safty belt and my roll bar I would have been in the grave by now, as it was the roll bar held and I ended hanging up side down in the Car. 
That is my main job, but as well I work at a garage in London, I made one big mistake when I just came there, I put one customers oil in his radiator, luckely I was not Sacked. One gets about five pounds a week, at home I spend most of my time servicing my Car and buying Spares, sometimes I work on the garden, usally the mowers break down so I have to mend them. The life I am leading is quite fun, and at times very exiting, but of course very dangerouse, I expect one of these days I will have a fatal Crash and enjore my self badly.  Words: 209
