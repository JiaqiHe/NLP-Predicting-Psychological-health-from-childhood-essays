When I leave school I would like to be a VET , Because I am interested in animals and Their habits. My Favoirite animals are horses and rabbits. I like cou*es from a distence but not when they are close up. I might want to be a nurse because I like helping people , or an Artist because I like drawing and painting. I like drawing better than painting. But because it's a long time to wait I might be somthing different thn what I want to be now.  Words: 89
