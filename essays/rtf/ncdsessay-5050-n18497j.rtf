----------------------
I have just left university and I am married with 1 child but my wife is now pregnant and in hospital expecting. I am just in my second year of training to be a sports journelist and next year I should be fully qualified. Apart from journalisisim I have a very large stamp collection and now have over 150 different covered toothpicks. I have a large Ivory chess set from Hongkong. which is very beutiful but also very delicate and so does not get played with much. I am a keen [football club] suporter and have a season ticket.
      In my training for a journalist I go to Hockey matches, Rugby matches Football matches, Cricket matches and gradually I pick up the rules I write reports on matches, but they are not off course published. I hope to write for the [newspaper] but I must work myself up the line slowl*y so first I must write for the [newspaper].  Words: 159
