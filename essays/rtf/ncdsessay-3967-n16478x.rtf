I'am leading a good life now and I'am working and getting good wages , I give my mum quite a lot of it , and keep the rest to myself . I go out to some record - hops and somtimes I stay at home and watch T.V. I'am working at a big store down in (place) and I get 25xxxx 18s for working two weaks , I give my mum the twenty pound and I keep the rest I buy things for my family and they do not bad . I sometimes go out with my friend to (place) that is when I'am of work. I think it is great but now that I'am older I wish I was back at school to see all my teachers again and to go through all my exams and to meet all my old freinds again , And when I shall have gone through it all again and start another new .
