Now I am 25 I have lots of things to do Iam just married so as soon as I get in from being at work I have to cook a meal I am not at home so Mummy can't cook it for me She sometimes come for coffe in the evening but not awfully often because she does not live awfully near It was a glorious day that day and I had a day of I went to do my shopping as usual. Then just as I got home the door bell rang. I was just going up to make my bed when I saw dad standing against the door looking exhauted I asked him what was the matter and he said he had run from the station too tell me something important. I am to the next door neighbour to ask what the I could do. He said that he should be put on a chair and rested there for half am hour with a hot drink so many things to remember I didnt know it was like this at 25. Then I went up to make the bed for it was high time I did. Then I found dad coming up the stairs to help sit down I told him your do yourself an injurry. a few day had past and I was feeling weary so I decided to play temrus with my friend she wanted something to do so we played a game. When I got home I found I had'nt done any washing up. Here we go again I thought to myself . When it was all done I sat down to do my needle work. Then to myself I thought what a hard life it is when your 25 but it's exciting.  Words: 297
