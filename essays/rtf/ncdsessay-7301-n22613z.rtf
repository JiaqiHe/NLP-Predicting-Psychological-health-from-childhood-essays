"I am working at a Vet and a nice Job it is too I do most of my studying at home. I have a Big cottage down at [town]. There is a big kitchen where I can do lots of cooking and a big dining-room where I can have lots of guests to come and sample my cooking.
      I have got 10 hamsters, 4 Horses, 2 foals, 1 pony, 2 dogs. As I am a vet sometimes I am woke up at 4 Am in the morning. But I don't realy mind Because I don't like to see animals suffer not if I can help it. The adress of the Vet is
                                                           [address]
he is a very good vet he can make nearly any-thing well again.
      But I am thinking of leaving the Job to become a cooking teacher, which I am very good at, I have got a A and O level at. I used to study Cooking but I was so atact to animals that I disceded I would study them , but to me I could not face all these animals being put to sleep but I surpose it has to be done. Little children come in with hamsters suffering from parilis which is caused by a cage not being long enough or wide enough. I do a lot of studying at home about animals, which I find very intresting. Last week when I had given a Cake to a friend, she said that I should take up cake making, I told her that I might she said I don't see why not you are quiet a good cook. 
      The next day I went and asked if I Could have a day or, and he said ""yes"" so I went and aplied for the Job"  Words: 298
