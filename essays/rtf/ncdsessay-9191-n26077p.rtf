I am now 25 years old and I have been a secretary for six years. I live in a flat in [town] and I am quite settled in this area. I am married and have one small child called [female name], she is just three months old. My parents live quite near and enjoy looking after [female name] while I am at work. I often have a lot of travelling to do but just the same I love my job because it is so interesting I shall stop work in six months time. At the moment my husband and are saving up for a house of our own. My husband is employed at the office too but he is leaving soon and is going to work in the bank as a clerk. My sister often comes round at nights and we watch television and play cards. At the weekends I help at the Methodist Church by arranging all the services. [female name] was christened there last January. We often go round the shops at [town] and chose our furniture for the future house. We have worked it out and found that it is xxxx850 to buy new furniture etc. We have got only xxxx600 in the bank but we are hoping to save more in the next six months.  Words: 219
