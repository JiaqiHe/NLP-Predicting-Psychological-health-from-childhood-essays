"I am now 25 years old and I am a Typist. I work for a company called ""growing plants LTD"" I type letters to people and I tell them how long the plants will take to get to where theylive. I start work at 8 o'clock and finish at 5 o'clock. I enjoy working there. I live in a flat and it is very comfortable. I like collecting things like stamps, old shells and old money. I dont go to work on Saturday but I do from Monday till Friday. I have no Children. I enjoy looking after Pets I have a goldfish and a dog but the Landlady does not agree with them. The goldfish is a year old and the dog is 11 months old. On Saturdays I work in a Bread Shop it is very nice there. I watch people making cakes and they are very good at it. At nights I go out to a club. but on Sundays I stay at home and watch Television. I like going to work because you make friends there. I get xxxx15-0-0d a week and I get xxxx3-0-0 on Saturday.
