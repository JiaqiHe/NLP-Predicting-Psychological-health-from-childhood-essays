When I am 25 I may be married and I may be a house wife or at work I may have some children. If I go to work I work in a shop, to be a hair dresser or a nurse I be very interesting in cooking. I may not be married I may be a spinster. I would like to be a nurse very much. I would like to have a shop of my own and lead a good life and to be abull to take driving lessons* and have a car of my own. I may life in a flat house or a banglo I may life with my mother if I am not married I may be a guide or a brownie leader. I may life in a nother country or town.  Words: 135
