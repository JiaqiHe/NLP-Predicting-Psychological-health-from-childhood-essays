When I am 25 I would like to get married. and live in a house and not have more than four children I would like two girls and two boys. I would get a job not more than two miles away. and have a three bedroom house a room for the two boys and a room for the two girls and a room for my husband and I. If I had all girls or all boys I would let them pick thier room. But if I had three boys and one girl I would let the girl pic first and then the boy have the othere room. But if I had three girls and one boy the boy would pick first.  Words: 121
