I am 25 years old and I am a waitress at a Hotel in (place) and I live with my Mother and Father and my brother who is 16 years old. I don't think that I will ever get married because I want to live with my Mother and help at home as will go where I work. My hobbies are not what there were I like reading, cooking and I still do like dancing but not much as I did before. In my spare times I go out to clubs go to the cinema. I have my own car it is a morris and I drive to work every morning. I work 5 days a week not Saturday and Sunday. Last year I went to Italey for my holiday I enjoyed it very much I went with my Mother, Father and my brother I can not remember where we stayed but where ever it was it was nice and clean. I made all the beds every morning and was still ready for breakfast at 9. o. clock. We went out every morning after breakfast for a walk over the fields near by we stayed for a fort night.
