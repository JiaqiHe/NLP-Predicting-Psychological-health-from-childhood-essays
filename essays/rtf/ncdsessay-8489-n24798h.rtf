I would be settling down in Austraila working at sheep* shearring I may be married and we would live in a carvan till I had saved anoght to by a bounglo. I would have a Land**rover to travel over rough COuntry to farms. Everthing might have to change because there is a substance which you put over the sheep and you just pull the wool off. Then I would get a speed boat and a suf a thached to the boat and I could sky* along the water.  Words: 88
