I am working in a shop. I like it very much. I get up at 7.30 in the morning I have my breakfast and I go to work. I get to work at half past 8. At half past 1 at dinner time we have our dinner break. Then we go back to work and we close at 6.O.clock. then I do my shopping and go home. I live in a flat I have one room at the top I have to pay 4 and a 1/2 pounds a week. When I get in I have my tea and then I would play some records. (Pop Music) After I had had enough I would go and visit my friends. Then I would come home and make some coffee and go to bed. In bed I would read my books. At the weekends I would go to the pictures with my friends. And on Sundays I would go swimming.  Words: 158
