When I am 25 I want to find a job as a mechanic with car sand I would drive my car home at break time and have a meal. I would travell around the world alot in my holidays. If I do get married and have any children i would play with them a lot on the lawn. I will spend most of my time sitting in my home reading books and drawing pictures of animals and birds. When my holidays are over i would be glad to get back to work and earn some more mooney and then after two weeks I will be bored stiff with work If I do give my Job up I hope to become a foot-baller for a f irst division foot ball team.
