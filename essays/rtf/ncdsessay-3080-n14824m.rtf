I am leading a simple but quite hard life. I have been married for three years to a very nice man who is also simple. Although we still live in a small flat we have a very happy time together but our ambison is to have a house in a friendly neighbourly place. My mother and father are very kind to me as I am going to have a baby in five months time. Unfortunetly I have had to leacve my secratariel course because of the near futer baby. My husband is a button merchant and enjoys it very much at the small factory he works in. I am still very keen on horses and remember my pony club days and thing of what tremendos fun I had. I try and go to any local jumping events My flat I live in is nice and neat but does get very untidy at times. I love going for long country walks and so does my husband We often go to a park in the country and take our lunch and perhaps we will cover over five miles of the land seing many beautiful thing, deer and trees. I am looking forward to having the responsiblety of having my own children. My husband urns good money and we are quite poor we save up some money every week even if it is only 2s 6d. We are both keenly interested in the riding school my friend owns and quite often I go and teach my knowlegde or have a lesson myself. I love looking after any animal but we thought it best not to have one yet because our child might take  Words: 280
