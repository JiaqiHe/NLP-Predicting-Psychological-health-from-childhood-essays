Myself at 25
I am 25 years old, and I like to look after animals. Sometimes I do some gardening. One of my hobbys is bird watching. Althogh I am getting older I still play at football and cricket with my friends. I go to football matches. I like to listen to music and play records. I try to learn to play any instrument I can. I go to car shows and sometimes drive one. One of my favourite hobbys is playing tennis. A lot of my friends have bicycles and I have aswell, we go on long rides on them. My favourite animal is a dog, horses are all right but they are too much to keep. Pigeons budgies and canarys are next, but I cant forget the easiest one of all to keep, the tortoise.  Words: 136
