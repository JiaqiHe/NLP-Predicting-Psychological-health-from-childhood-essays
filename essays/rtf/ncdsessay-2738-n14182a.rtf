I am now 25 and I am an air hostess and I travel in the airoplane to Astralea and back every day. Sometimes I go to Canada and back. I like traveling. Sometimes we go somewher and stay over night. I lived in a hotel in London then I got a houes in the cuntry. I start walk at six in the morning and finish at seven at night. When I am walking I look after the pasenders and bring them rifresh ments. If a pasender get ill I will bring them somthing to help. Often I have to help the people who have not had a trip on an airoplane beofor. I have to make the captins lunch because he will be flying all day in some flyts.  Words: 129
