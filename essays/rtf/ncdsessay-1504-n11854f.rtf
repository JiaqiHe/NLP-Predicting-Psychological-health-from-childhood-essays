If I was 25 years old now I would be married or looking for a wife or engaged. I would hope to be a rector, or a criketer or both. I would be quite busy getting to know my first Parish (if a rector) and visiting people and taking services. My wife and I might well be thinking about a baby. I would hope for a boy. I would go out abit in the Evening, though not every night. I am trying to get to know my neighbours and eld a social life. I would try to find spare time to practice criket and try to become and England Player and also a county player.  Words: 115
