I live in a bungalow in the South of Scotland My work is mostly in the shop, nearly always exept Sundays then I go to church. after that I take the car and go out for a drive around the countryside. When there are holidays I usually drive up to (place) to see my folks. at any other spare time I have, I read books the bangalow which I live had been built last year I have central heating and all other within-reach luxury's. I like doing house work best and also tidying up the garden which is rather large I am married with four children my huspb*nd owns the shop were I work. The bungalow is not far away from the shop in fact it is just across the road.  Words: 131
