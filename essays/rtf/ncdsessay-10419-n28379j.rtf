I am a nurse. I am married and live in a village in a small bungalow. I am intrested in swimming and often go on the bus to the town swimming bath near by. We have a dog but no children.I work at the villige surgery every day in the week except sunday. The neighbours were both old so we know not many people. The only person we know is the old man next door as the other old folk hardly ever went out. my husband is an engineer and works in the town. We own a mini and often go out in the country for rides. I saw a lot and make many make many of my own dresses. We have no television or telephone. It is a small villiage and there are hardly any shops so we often are in town. The country side around is pleasant. We have been in this house for * year just and like it.It has two bedrooms which are a good size enough for a doble bed ect.  Words: 176
