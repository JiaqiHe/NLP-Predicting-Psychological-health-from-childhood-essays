My Life.
I am twenty five years old and I work at London Air Port as a air-hostess. I live in a flat with my flat mate (name). I am very good at my job and I go to different countrys every day. I am going to Norway to do some ski-ing, as are flight does not leave for a few days My flat mate and I are very good friends and we do a lot of things together, my friend has got a boyfriend and so have I. I have been living in a flat for a couple of years. (name) only came and lived with me in January. I have passed my exams and have got a few O'Levels and some A levels so i can be an air-hostess. I like flying to different countrys every day and sometimes you meet very important people My flat is very untidy as I and my friend are not very tidy We go swimming at week-ends. My work is very interesting. I like to listen to music and in my spare time I am a dress maker I have a box room at the top of the flat where I do my dress making I am very frienly with the pilots and the other hostess's. I go to evening classes every Tuesday and Fridays. I find evening classes are very interesting and they teach you a lot of interesting things about different countries and places in the world. I also play the guitar in my spare time. After I come home from a flight I go home, have a few hours slep then go back to work. An air-hostess's job is very tiring.  Words: 281
