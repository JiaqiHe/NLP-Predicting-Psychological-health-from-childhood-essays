I am 25 years old and I am an air hostess. I travel all over the world with my job. I own a flat and I spend most of my spare time out of doors. I also like swimming. I do not get home as much as other people but I like my job. I live in Nuneaton and it has changed quite a lot. I cannot keep pets in my flat but my mother keeps pets and I see them every time I go to visit her. When I go to the beach I go water-sking. I lead a normal life really. I go out into the country or to the seaside when I have my holidays. I meet lots of different people on my job. My brother askes me to bring him dolls with national costume on every time I go to different countrys. I have a farly easy job but I had to work hard to get it. It was worth it though. I enjoy my life really. I have severel friinds that are air hostesses and we sometimes have partys together. We also go out together when we have time off. I can drive a car so I can get around quite a lot. The job I do is somtimes very intersting. I get a farly big wage and I save about a half of it so that if I keep on saving I will have quite a lot of money so that I can get married and put a depossit on a new house and buy some furniture. I also would like a new car but it will have to wait untill I have some more money in the bank.  Words: 285
