When I am 25 I will in joy my life because I will be at work and I will be able to go to places. I will not get married because when you have children you can not go any where because you will have to take you wife and children with you. I will not drink beer like most people do. I will just go out with friends. I would like to play for a football team ales I would like to be a sw* I would go on my scooter bike and I could take my friends on the back with me. For my job I would like to be a man who gose to all places and gets a lot of money. I will give my man my board money and I can keep the rest for my self to pay for my scooter bike and for other things.  Words: 152
