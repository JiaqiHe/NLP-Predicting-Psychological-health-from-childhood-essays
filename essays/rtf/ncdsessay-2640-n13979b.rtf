"""Hello"" my name is [name] I am 25 and not married ""yet?"" I live in London although I used to live in Newcastle upon Tyne. I have a Job as a buisnesman in a bank. I like my Job and liike London. I get up every morning at half past severn and get a tube train to my bank. It is very crowded on the tube. with all sorts of people. at night I dont usualy go out since I work late. Saturdays I go to a football match. sometimes I have to go to other countries. Like New York or Germany, Paris. I go on buisness trips. I go by BOAC jets and I have got a foriend working as a pilot on them. on my holidays I go to other countries. I usauly watch football matches and I support Arsnel. I like cricket too, and I watch them play. My house is a new one in the middle of London. Very handy for the tube. I used to have a house on the outskirts of London it was very big. and old so I got a new one. we have banks all over the world it is a very big company I have been offered other jobs, but I stay with the bank. sometimes I go out with friends to clubs. It is not a boreing life in London but it dose have its times. At Christmas we have a party that is my foriends and myself do. I have a car but do not go to work in it, and I am fortunate to have a privat plane. which I go up in at holidays. I can* fly very well."  Words: 283
