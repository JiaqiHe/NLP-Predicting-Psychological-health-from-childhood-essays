My interests in life are looking after animals and reading. I like to read horror stories and sometimes a novel. Cooking is something I enjoy very much and I do cooking in my spare time. 
I live with a friend and we each put something towards the rent of our house every week. My friend lives upstairs and I live downstairs. I have a pet dog which is a cross between a welsh collie and something else which I do not know. He is a good guard dog and loves a nice long walk in the woods. 
The food that he likes best is Mick mixed in with a tin of Bounce. And after he's eaten that he chews a bone. He chases cats up trees but he's afraid of them really.
Earlier on I told you that I looked after animals but the animals are very special because they are zoo animals. I have to check and make sure that each animal has the right food diet and that he is healthy. The cages of the animals must be kept clean and they must be disinfected every six months to make sure that all the germs are killed. The animals food trays are washed everyday and when people are making an animals dinner they must have clean hands, clothes and they have to wear hats to stop lose hairs from falling into the food. Every procausion is taken to make sure that the animals food is clean. 
Before the animals are put in the zoo the foriegn ones have to be put in quaranteen for one month to make sure that the animals has not get a disease or an illness.  Words: 281
