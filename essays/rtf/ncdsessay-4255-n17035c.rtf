----------------------
My name is [male name] [surname] and I am a Private in the army. My barracks are in Norfolk, the place in which I lives is made of wood and I share my home with five other people.
My hobbyes are collecting match-boxes, for when you are off duty it is very hard stopping yourself getting bored. Every day at six o'clock in the morning the bugler wakes us with a tune. I shave and wash myself. I then go the field practice, field practice is mainly self defence with a gun, a knife or even bare hands. We the go on to physical execise and swimming.
When we have time off I nearly always go to the town and have a big luncheon in the chinese resturant. At dinner time in the barracks our main course is stew and for afters custard.
I occasionally smoke, on Fridays we have gun practice we have a go at shooting with a bren*, bazooka and mortar. We ahve to frenade each and must destry a pill-box, I got one genade lodged in one of the crevices of the pill-box and it exploded and shattered the pill-box.
To go back to my hut in which I sleep, it has a rather large crack running down the wall. I sit sometimes watching the spiders crawling inand out of the crack. Being a soldier isn't really a bad life though.  Words: 231
