I am now 25 years old and I live with my mother in [town]. My present job is working in a sweet shop. I work 7 1/2 hours in a day 9am to 12noon and 1pm untill 5.30. My wages are xxxx8 a week. The shop I work in is [shop name] which is situated on the [street name], [London suburb]. I enjoy it very much.
I have a car which I bought 6 months ago, one of my hobbies is messing around with cars and motor bikes.
Another of my hobbies is sport. When I was younger my ambition was to be a footballer, and now I play for [town] Villa. Some Saturdays I go to football matches (mostly Spurs matches because I support Spurs.)
I have a girlfriend but she lives in Heston, and I do'nt see her much. That ends my story.  Words: 142
