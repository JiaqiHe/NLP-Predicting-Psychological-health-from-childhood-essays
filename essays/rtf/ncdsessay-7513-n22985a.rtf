----------------------
I am now 25 years old. I am married with two children (name) and(name). I went to collage after I left a secondary school, and I am now a nurse at (place). I finish work at seven thirty and my husband drives me home.
I go dancing once a week , and then we all go out to the pictures. I have to be up and at work very early, I listen to lectures on nursing sometimes.
My husband who is a teacher at a secondary school does not have to be at work so early takes me to the hospital.
My children who are both 5 go to a infant school and my husband helps them at the weekend with there school work.
Sometimes (name) or (name) bring a friend home to tea and that means making more tea , which my husband makes. On saturday my husband makes the bed and cooks dinner as I am at work. I think nurse - ing is a very nice job. You meet a lot of people and make a lot of friends
I live in a house out in the country, there is a little village about half a mile down the lane , where the children go to school. There are a few shops in the village a grocers a butchers. If you want to go to the swimming baths you have to catch a bus and go into (town) where there are more shops. I like the life I lead.  Words: 247
