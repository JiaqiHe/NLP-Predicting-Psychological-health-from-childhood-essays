I am married and I have an exciting life. I have two children, a girl and a boy. My hobbies are reading, swimming and looking after animals.
I am a vet. Each Monday, Wednesday and Friday I go round visiting farms to see if any animals are sick. On Tuesdays and Friday afternoons I wait for children to come to me with their sick pets.
Every Saturday morning I go to the swimming baths. I read in any spare time I have.
I am very interested in farm animals.  Words: 86
