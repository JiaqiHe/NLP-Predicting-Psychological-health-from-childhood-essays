I am twenty five years old I am maried. I am leading a quite life in the country with my two sons [male name] and [male name]. [male name] is eight and [male name] is seven. Sometimes we go down to the fields for a game of gootball. I am a miner I fit light cabels through the dirty damp tunnels. It is an hard job, and, also a very dirty one. After a days work I always have a shower because when we come up the shafts are faces cannot be seen at all for they are so black. Nerly every day men come up from the mines injured a broken leg or something like that. 
At home when I have a day off I usually watch the television or read a book. Sometimes I just go to bed and go to bed. 
Usually I go for a walk and see the countryside. I like to observe birds very much and I also like to keep them in cages. In the corner of the back garden there is a nesting box every year in the month of May a bluetit nests in it. last year it laid five eggs which were white with red spots on.  Words: 207
