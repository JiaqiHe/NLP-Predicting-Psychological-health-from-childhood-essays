6 o clock and the clock gives its song again I stop it so I go to another day of work the wife gets up puts my tea on the table a goes back up to bed and fall of to doze again. I got of and put my peace in my pocket and jump into my car and drive away to my work away in (place) it is about 40 miles away from my home town in (place) my work is an elictronic man My job is to check that every person does his job right and I have my own thing to work sometimes I make some carrdboard my self and fix up the boxes myself and give them to the transport company .
I sometimes are of duty so I can go and have some lunch and a cup of tea and then phone my wife and tell her when I will be coming home and what time at a few hours later I go home and before my eyes is a big dinner.  Words: 176
