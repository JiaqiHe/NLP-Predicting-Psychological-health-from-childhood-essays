At the age of twenty give I am leading a most interesting life. When I left university after studying languages, I was twenty two. I was offered a very good job with an airline company which meant I had to go to different countries as a representative. I have been to quite a few interesting countries, met many interesting aquaintencies, and improved my accent in some languages.
My home life too is very hectic. My sister is getting married in a few weeks and I am to be bridesmaid. Then my brother has just about served his apprenticeship, and will soon be a trainer joiner, whilst my youngest sister has just sat her highers.
A week after the wedding, I am flying out to America to join my pen-pal. whom I have not seen for three years. We hope to do a lot of sight-seeing together, and I am looking forward to that reunion. A lot of my interests are still the same as they were fourteen years ago. I still read a lot. and I enjoy a swim also. So on the whole, I am quite satisfied with my life at the moment.  Words: 192
