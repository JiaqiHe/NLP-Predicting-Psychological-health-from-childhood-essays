My ambition is to live on a farm and have two children a boy and a girls. I would like a lot of animals. My interest at home is house work and keeping (***) care of animals. I would get up at 6 o'clock work till 7.30. make the childrens breakfast get them up at 8 o'clock. Then when they are at school. Let the horses out in the fields. I would like the farm to be down the South. I would fead the pigs early in the morning and milk the cows. After I have done most of the things I would go to the shops to get the food. I would be back to make the dinner for my husband and childrens. Then clean the house up. Like clean the windows wash the clothes make the beds wash the dishes up.  Words: 143
