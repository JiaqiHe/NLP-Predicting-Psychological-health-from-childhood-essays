I have a job at a hospital I'm a nurse and I like my work a lot. I am married but I have no childeren yet I want 3 childeren when I'm settled in. I don't see much of my husband because he is at work. I do see him when he comes home then we have dinner together. We both like swimmering we go there often. We have a car (Cortina Estate). I work at hospital every day except Sunday and Wednesday night. I have made friends with lots of Nurses and people. I love being a nurse because I'm helping people My sister wull come and visit me a lot I hope, and I hope she will be different than she is now because she argues alot. I hope I am well of so I can buy a house for my Mother and Father. They say they don't want to have a house, that they rather live in an old peoples home. I want to live a good life and be happy. I would like to go a broad especially Italy. I would like to go to Italy because I once had a aunt who went there she was an orphan and she loved it there she told me all about it she is dead now. Her friends who went with her stayed with us because they wanted to see he ashes.  Words: 234
