I am just 25 years old and I am at University. I am mainly doing History and Art. For art I am not very keen on modern art but very keen on doing the old type of art. By this time I hope to be married as I wish to have a baby. At home I would like the modern furnature ect. I would like to have a house in the area that I live in now because it is kept tidy and there are lots of woods and there is no problem for shops. At about 27 I would like to leave university and spend some time at home. I would go on holiday about two time a year and spend about two weeks each time. In spare time at university I would do swimming and a bit of horse riding. For horse riding I would go with other people from the university. I would be very interested in the history from 1066 to 1100. I think this is a very nice time in history as new things came into use. I would also take notes about the people like Sir Francis Drake and other men who went out to sea. If these people had not been out to sea, we would not have a lot of the things that we have now.
