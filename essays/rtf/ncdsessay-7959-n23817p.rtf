I am now 25 years of age I left collage at 21 and started teaching . I now work In a private school teaching maths and science. I teach a class of approximately twenty and I engoy it very much. I live oin a bungaloe up the broadway near the school, I live there by my self and I have no intention of getting married. In the Bungaloe there are five rooms a Bathroom, a Bedroom, a Kithchen a lounge and a dining room. I have got a miny van and it takes me around very nicely indeed. I usually invirte my freinds to dinner once a month and I cook a French meal for them. Sometimes the school I teach in goes out on school trips abroad and I usaly go with them. But evry time I do I always think of the day I went to haddon Hall with my class and my grandmother came with me too. She kept on telling me to smile and to sit up Straight and not to talk in the Bus. The next day in our class we had to wright about the trip we all went on and I wrote that the best part of it was going home because my grand mother was such a nagg and ever since that day I have always rememberd that class trip. My school I taught in went to France last year to learn the French accent propely. I went with them and I engoid it very much and I am realy engoiyiing my days alive.  Words: 262
