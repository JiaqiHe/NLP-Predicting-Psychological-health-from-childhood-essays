I am 25 I own a pottery shop and I am in the money I live in the shop on a seaside resort. I am hoping to get a much bigger business going and lots of poeple working for me. Then for a year or so I would leave the business to my vice* director and go away for a nise* month holiday to south Africa. Out there I would not have to get a job for I would have taken alot of the money with me. For my spare time I would draw, paint and sculpture. I would after the six months come back to Britain stay at my work for a year or two. Then off touring I would go again a week in wales, a week in Scotland a week in Irland and two weeks in Cornwall. After my touring I would hope to settle down in a nice house or bungalow. I would have a white wedding if I could afford it and also if I could afford a two weeks honeymoon in Spain. I would like to have two children one a girl and one a boy. I would put my children before myself and my husband. I would try to bring them up as happy children and I would give up my pottery job, to take care of them. When I get old and my children have got married I would still like to get out on the weekends and stay traped in between four walls all the time.  Words: 255
