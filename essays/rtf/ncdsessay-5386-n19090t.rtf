My job is a Children's Nurse at [hospital name] Children's Hospital. Dancing is my main interest and I go once a week, I go with my friends. I live in a two-roomed flat in [town], and I'm single. At night I study at home, and try to catch up with my work. I work from 9am till 5pm. My job is quite interesting and I'm studying to be a Matron. I have my own car that is quite handy. I work on floor 3 Ward 2B. Most of the children in my ward have been runover or have had something missing. I wouldn't mind being a patient because you have Ice-cream, and the nurses play with the children. At evening time you watch the television and have milk and biscuits. For breakfast you have. Cornflakes, Bacon, Egg Tomato, Tea or Coffee. Dinner you have Yorkshire pudding, beef, gravy, mash or roast potato and jelly. Tea you have bananna sandwiches, fruit and ice-cream. And supper as you know. So you see being a Childrens Nurse is not so bad afterall.  Words: 179
