I live in a little cottage in the country, were I have a pony stud which takes up all my time. I have one or two girls living with me in my cottage, who help with the stud. There are four neat little bedrooms with horsy pictures and ornaments mund the room. One of my mares has just given birth to a sweet little palimns colt, who is so mischerfuss its untrew, but the mother is not very well and the cold is not getting any milk, so I am busy feeding the little thing to keep it alive. 
     I run all the bussiness things, and I have just sold one of last years colts his name is high hopes the *. The girls and I get on well together and we have great fun when we go into town on saturday nights. 
      We get up carly every morning and go out excesing on the moors. There is one spacele place were we gallop for about a mile it is gorjass, the early morning breeze in your face. 
     I lead a happy life here in the country and I am glad I bought the farm and the little cottage. I have one favorite mare and she was my first mare her name is starlight. I am very happy here in the country and would not chance it for any thing.  Words: 233
