I am 25 years old now and I am a policeman. On my beat I go all round the town and sometimes on Saturdays I go to football matches and see that there is no fighting. I have a wife and a boy, I get the house from the police and I get xxxx20 a week. I don't think it is a daungourus job like some people think, but some-time the are fights late at nights when the public houses close. I like this job very much and I would not swop it for any other job. When I go on duty at night I feel quite lonley because the is no-one with me accept sometimes another policeman who has the same beat as me. 
The is not much to do accept patrol the streets and when there is something to do I do it. I am in the police football team and I play centre half. My hobby is swimming and going to football matches. Sometimes I go around to some schools and teach them about road safety. I went in for the jobe when I was sixteen and I liked it then very much. I am interested in football because I blay for the police and I support Leeds Utd, I have support them since I was 9 years old. The house I have got has 3 bedrooms, 1 living room, 1 kitchen, 1 bathroom, 1 hall, 1 landing, and 1 lavatory. I am in the police force culb and I like it very much.  Words: 257
