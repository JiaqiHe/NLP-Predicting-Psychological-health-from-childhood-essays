I am studying my degree for medicine . In two weeks time I shall be sitting my exam-s for a doctor in that test . If I pass it will be a great sucses. I could go to see my big brother (name) who now lives in Amercia. I will be getting a car from my father as he said he woul-d get me one. I like going to the ice rink , and most of all I like swimming. My life at home is a very pleasant . I come home from work and my mum has my tea ready I would not leave home for all the money in the world I like my work . It shows you manlikeness in all of us . It shows us diffrent things in life . I would like to go to forieng countreis . There are so many diesases in this world we can not cure them all . I have only one comp-liemt that in forieng caintrie you have to pay for your illness. By the I become a doctor I will think about taking a illness on the conteinet.  Words: 191
