"For the last five years i have writen books about birds*. Most of my book's have been famous. To-morrow I am going over to Africa to write a book about African birds. At home I always get my camera and put a film in it* ready to take pictures of birds. A few of my books are all about birds in Winter. Apart from birds, one of my interests is painting land-scapes and trees. I have won twice with my paintings and came second once. Soon I'll be going to Brazil. In Brazil I have a summer house. When I went to the Amozon I found some Inca gold coins. I went back to an expert  at old coins. He said, ""they were worth over xxxx7,000"". I thought of all the things I could buy with it but I knew that it would have to be given in. In Africa I hope to film some rare birds that are nearly extinct. I am not married and I intend to stay that way The book* on African birds is going to be the biggest book I have written. I always have my friends at home with me and look at my books."  Words: 201
