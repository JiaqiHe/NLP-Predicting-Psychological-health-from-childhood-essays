I am living in (town) with my cousin (name) who owns a farm. Every morning I wake up about 6 o'clock and read untill 6.30 when I get up. I cook breakfast ussually eggs and bacon after I have fed the sheep.
(name) comes downstairs about eight o'clock feeling sleepy.
Every Saturday (name), (name) brother spends the day with us. (name) is a teacher at a Junior School in (town). In the summer we take (name), the dog to the beach a few miles away, and the farm-hands are in charge. When we go there, we take a picnic lunch , and about five shillings to spend on ice-creams and drinks. Most of the time that we are at the beach we spend in the sea. We have lunch about 12.30, and we do not go into the sea until one hour after we have finished lunch. We catch an open top bus back to (town), and when we get back about 6 o`clock we have a hot meal that (name) and I cook together. By the time we have finished it, it is about 7 o`clock. (name) spends the night in the spare-room and goes back to (town) the following evening On Tuesdays, we usually go to visit (name) Parents who live in (town). We sleep the night, as we do not hurry over the evening meal, and return in (name) car the following day as the town is not busy as it is early closing day. Wednesday is a very busy day for us as visitors come from four different towns to buy and sell animals. On the farm there are a number of hens, some cattle and four horses.  Words: 280
