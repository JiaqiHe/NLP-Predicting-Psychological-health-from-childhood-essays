I am 25 years old my name is Julie Harris I work in shop, I'm a shop assisstant, I have left home and I live in a flat they are very tiny flats and big enough for 1 person. I lead my own life which is looking after myself. Cooking, dressmaking, and tidying up my little flat. I enjoy my work, and I work from 8 o.clock to 5.30. I fill the shelves with cans of food also bottles of drink. e g orange, lemon, lime, ribena, Juices, and also work at the till. I f I get bored in the evening I go to the pictures to my friends house or stroll about looking in shop windows to see what I could buy the next day. In the morning I get up bright and early dead on seven o clock in time to have my breakfast and to do some tidying up and to catch the 1/4 to 8 bus to get to work. It's very handy to walk to the town but I feel lazy in the mornings. When I come home from work my feet ache from running up and down stairs to get things from the cellar, tihngs like soap powder, drinks, boxes of goods. I have only just left school and have just started my job as a shop assisstant. My friend works in the cafeteria across the road and I always went there to have my lunch so that we could chat for a while. After a while I got used to the job and found it wasn't as hard as it looked when I first started.  Words: 273
