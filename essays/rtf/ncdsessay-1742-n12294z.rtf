When I am twenty five years old I hope to be married and I would like a house at [town] or [estate]. My job will either be a typest or a teacher. I hope I don't grow too tall and I would like to have a man who is not lazy a just hangs around the house and goes to the bar each night for a drink. I would like to have only two children a boy and girl who grow up to be people. If my job was a typest I would like it to be at [company]s shop because a lot of men and women go there. The days of the week that I hope to get a day off is Saturday for I would be able to go out to dances and to the cinema and I would take the children to the tatteler to see some cartoons. I would have two smart children but I don't know I may have more or none. My husband will be a mechanic. and. I will often go to see my brother, mother and father who will be called grandmother and grandfather if I have children. On Sundays I will go to church to pray for all those who are in hospital and for Jesus who was crusified upon the cross. I will go to the library to get out some books on cookery and some others that interests me. I hope to be a good cook and that I wiil be able to follow patterns to make jumpers cardigans much easier and I will make some cotton dresses for myself and I am wishing that I will be a good typest or even become a student teacher before a proper one.
