I am training to teach 11 year olds at college. I always liked school when I was young, and I liked to teach small children to count, read, and write. ** like geography. (where you find out and write about a certain town or village) I go to church every Sunday, as I started to when I was quite young. Ever since I was eleven I have wanted to be an every-day teacher. I like General Knolage. and finding out things and I also like writing about a certain subject. I've got a boy-friend at another college which I see at half term. I like to see my family when I go home. at the moment I'm at a school trying out teaching. I do this for three weeks then I go back to college, where I do some more work. During this time I am hoping to go and teach at Jersey. in a school thats quite well known. I have the weekends of to do what I like.  Words: 170
