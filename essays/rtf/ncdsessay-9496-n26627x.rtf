When I am 25 years old, I hope to be a short-hand typist. I am not going to get married. I also hope to travel around abit. In my leisure time I hope to become a Guide Captain. I would be living at home. I also hope to go to the Pitmans training College for some more exprenice on short-hand typrying. On Satardays and Sunday's I would spend my leisure time on taking my parent's to the coast and going to different places like, London, Wales, Grimby Harbour and Scotland. I have heard a lot about these places, and even been to London, and I am sure they are very interesting. I would also like to become a proffesionl ballroom dancer and compete against other people. I would most probaly abandon the idea of collecting post cards, I don't think I would swimming though. Because I am trying to get somewhere with my swimming and prhaps one day I will become famous. I would like to became a archeoilist and collect all types of rock and mineral's and one day, who knows I may discover a gold mine. I would have a touring van because they are a lot cheaper than hotels and inns.  Words: 204
