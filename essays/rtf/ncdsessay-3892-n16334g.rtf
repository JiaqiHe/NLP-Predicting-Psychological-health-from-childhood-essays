I would like before I am ttwenty five to go to university and then when I am twenty five to be already in a job. (I would like to be a police-man by the time I am twenty-five) I would have probably left home by twenty-five and be engaged. (or I might even be married by twenty-five).
I would like to be leading a very happy life. In the police-force I hope to be in a panda car or on a motor bike pa***lling the streets. I hope for my interests I will probably train a lot over I on* the park. (running etc) so that I can keep fit. I* hope to be in the police football team) I haven't thought of anything else I'd like to be when I am twenty-five but by that time I will probably have a lot more ideas than just being a police-man.
