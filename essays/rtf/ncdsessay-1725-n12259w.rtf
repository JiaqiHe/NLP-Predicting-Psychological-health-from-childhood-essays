I would like to be a secretery of a teacher. I still though would like to be some kind of scientist, whose* work would be to discover different kinds of machines. The interests I have would still be based on animals. The way they live and mate. I would not live on my own. If I had no husband I would try and share a flat with a well educated girl. I would also try and mix with people who speak no slang and who have manners. In my holidays I would like to go to university where I could do a little bit of extra work on my job.  Words: 110
