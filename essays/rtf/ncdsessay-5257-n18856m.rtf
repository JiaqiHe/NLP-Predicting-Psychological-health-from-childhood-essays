I am now 25 years old. At 21 I was married. I have now got 1 child. She is 1 year old I work as a typist. I get a baby-sitter to look after the baby. Sometimes in my spare time I like going swimming, but I can't, really go swimming now. Ussually I do dress-making for myself and my child. When my child is at school I work in the morning and do the housework in the afternoon. Sometimes I take my child swimming. So she can get used to the water and to give her legs and arms exersise. On Saturdays I might go to the cinema. While my child goes ballet dancing I might go as a shop assistant part time. What I like doing mostly is cooking.  Words: 131
