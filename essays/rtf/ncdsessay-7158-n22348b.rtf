----------------------
I am living in Wales I have a wife & three children. I work at a police station in [village]. My house is quite big it has a living room, a sitting room & kitchen four bedrooms & a bathroom. I enjoy being a policeman, & working there. My wife is a nurse at the local hospital which is not very big. My children are going to [school]. which is not far from the hospital. We have a big, a Wolsey 1800 & a caravan.
      I like living in Wales because it near the sea and you don't have to drive miles to get to the sea & if we don't want to go to the sea there are plenty of places to drive to which are quite near.
      Every three years we go to America for our holidays & we sometimes go to Ireland instead. if we don't go to either of those we go somewhere with our caravan. I am intrested in cars & motor-bikes which are good because they both used in sports which I like. When I am at home I tidy up the garden. & mow the lawn. I have made a shed in the garden & painted it dark blue. We two labradors a rabbit & a horse which are in the field behind the house. We have an acre of land altogether. I think I am going to breed labradors for show dogs. I have showed one labrador & it won second prize, but it wasn't a very big show. but I will enter it in a bigger show next time.  Words: 268
