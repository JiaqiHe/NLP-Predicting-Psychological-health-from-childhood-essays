----------------------
I would carry on with the interests I have now, which are chess, swimming, boating, reading and some sports such as rugby, football and cricket. My work would be in the Royal Navy as an officer. I'd see many countries and go along way from home to see far off land such as America, Australia, Russia etc. I would be a diver and navigator.
When I am on leave I will go home to my Mother and Father, if I am married I will go home to my wife and we will have a home of our own. I will have a car or motor bike, and we will go on holiday every year.  Words: 113
