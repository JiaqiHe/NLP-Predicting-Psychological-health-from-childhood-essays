I work at a big Shop in [city]. I am a fully qalified hairdresser. I work from 10. O'Clock am to 4.30 pm. I see a lot of people most I know but Some I do not. Eventually its time to go I catch the bus from [road] to my little flat quite near [road] a very posh arear. I have my tea and perhaps go round the Shops for a few odd groceries. When I get home I get all my Stamps and Stamp books and things. I enjoy Stamp Collecting, I once went to a Stamp Collection and Saw the Black Penny Stamp being actioned that when I was 23 years old. Later that evening my boyfriend came round asking me to come out with him I excepted his invation. The next morning I woke up at half past Six or So I thought I got up thinking I had plenty of time I glanced at the clock panic Stations it was ten past ten. I got the bus as quick as I Could half way there I remembered its wednesday all day Closing oh no. I got back home fast as I could remembering my driving lesson I had just failed the actual test Some a few more lessons and then the test in the afternoon I went and Saw my parents as they had asked me to tea my dad talking about fishing all the time and my mum about her aches and pains. That night I made my Self a Cup of Coffee and went to bed. A end to a perfect day.  Words: 268
