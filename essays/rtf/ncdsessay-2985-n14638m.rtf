----------------------
I have decided to stay on at university and to lead a university life. I have a degree in physics and am going to try to get a proffessorship in that subject. I already have a girl-friend in the same college. She has one more year left, then she will be going on to teachers training college. I have a car, I only bought it a few days ago, with xxxx450 support from my father. In seven years time he will be retiring to live in [town] with my mother.
      This year I will be going for an eighteen day holiday in Greece, for which I have been saving up for quite a time. I am very much looking forward to it.
      I live in a flat in [city], quite near to the college, ([college]), which I go to . It is very convienient, for it is very near the [library]. When I get married, I intend to move into a bigger flat nearby.
      Life is very tiring, but very enjoyable. It is now Easter, and I am looking forward to going back to the hullabaloo of city life.  Words: 189
