I am 25 years old and I am a lifegard at a outdoor swimming pool I work from 10am 8pm and I live with my mother and father in a house in (name of place). I  leave for work at 9am in the morning. I play games in my spare time for some clubs. I go to bed about half past ten to eleven o'clock and get up at 8 o'clock in the morning. My interests are Reading and Writing I go out for days when I have holidays when I am not working that is in the winter I get another job because the swimming pool is closed. and it is only open in the summer time. My other job is working at a a indoor pool and I have my holidays in the middle of the year round about June and July I go with my friends on holiday.  Words: 151
