I am working in an office as a short hand typist. When I get home from work I like to read the papers and see what has been happening in the news. On Saturday i go swimming I also like to play tennis when i can in the summer. I do not stay with my mother and father but stay in (place) with another girl. At Sundays I go to church and sometimes in the afternoon I go and visit my mother and father At night I often go out with my friend to dances or the cinema. I like watching television and listening to pop records. I often draw in my spare time . I am the leader of a Guide pack near where I stay I enjoy my work there as I was at guides when I was younger  Words: 141
