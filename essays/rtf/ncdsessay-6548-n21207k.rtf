I started out for the garage I hurryed down the road because I had two car's to fix as I came into the garage I saw my friend Joe he said the boss wanted me in his ofice. I thought what on earth did he want me for I walked in, he told me to sit down. he told me that I could leave the two car's at the garage becase I had to go to [motor racing circuit]. When I got there I had to mend a raceing car as I was mending the engine I caught my beard in the fan wheel it took part of it out and when I looked in a mirror I had a bauld patch on my chin in the afternoon when I had finisht the mannager asked me would I like to have a go in one I said yes please it would be an experence for me. At two o'clock I got into my car but as I looked round there were two other drivers one, [male name] [surname] and the other [male name] [surname]. Both of them were expert drivers I though I would never beat nither of them. At the last lap I went into the lead but [male name] came first I was second and [male name] was third.  Words: 221
