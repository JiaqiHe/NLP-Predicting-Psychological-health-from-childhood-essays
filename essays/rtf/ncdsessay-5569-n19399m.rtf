If I had a job I would first of all do that. When I come home I would probably do some gardening. If it was a night job I would enjoy myself. I would probably go around walking because I like finding out about places in the city. I like going around in car`s to town to town. If I did have a job I would like to be a car macanic. I want to be a car macanic because everyone else knows about car`s so why should'nt I know about them. And if I was a macanic I would probably get a car. The best car I would like is a Zepher 6. Its a big car and a good one. If you had a night job you would have to sleep in the day time. But there would be quite a lot of noise in the day time so it would be hard to go to sleep. I would join some club so I had something to do in my spare time. You would be playing all s or ts of games with the club.  Words: 187
