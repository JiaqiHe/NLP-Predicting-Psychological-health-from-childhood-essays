I would have a job a hairdressing one mainly. I would still do a lot of sports like swimming and running. Maybe get married and live in a nice house. I would do a lot of cooking and keep many pet animals (mainly dogs, I would like to travel a lot to many thrilling places like Brazil Switzeland. Germany and many other places. But mostly I would settle down at home and enjoy doing my own cooking. I would look after the many animals that I have enjoy looking at them running about happily. Reading is a good hobby of mine and I could join a library and read in my spare time. The house that I would live in would be somewhere out of town where there would be no noisy traffic.
