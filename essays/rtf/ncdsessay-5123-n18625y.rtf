today I got a job as a vet in newcastle, my first patiece was a dog with tooth ache and I removed the rotten molar. I have a house just outside [town] with quite big grounds I am not married and have a horse called midnight, and two cocker spaniels called rex and rover. There is a river running through the grounds where I can swim and fish. My mother and father live with me. In autumn I go shooting and fox hunting with the nearest villagers. before I just got my job I was still at colledge where I got my certifactate for a vet. I also breed game birds they are kepted at the back of the house.  Words: 120
