I am now 25 and I have got a job in the army. I am an engineer and I work on tanks and jeeps. In September 1968 I was sent overseas to Japan to help build tanks and jeeps and other machinery. I was awarded a medals and we had a six week leave. In the six weeks, me, my wife and my son went for a holiday, we went to Jersey and we had a great time. We went to the fairground twice and we went on a cruiser back to England and I had to start making tanks and jeeps all over again I enjoyed the holiday very much and I sent postcards to all my friends in the army saying what a great time me and the family had.
