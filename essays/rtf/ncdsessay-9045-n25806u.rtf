When I was a child I had a desire to emigrate and take my parents with me. I also wanted to become a scientist and in my spare time breed birds. Now my wishes have come true. I live in South America and I am a professor in Astromamy. At home my mother does the cooking and a little house work and my father is very interested in the garden and spends most of his time growing vedgetables and some kinds of fruit. At night when I come home from work I feed my bird in their but at the bottom of the garden. If I get up early enough the burds get cleaned out before I go to work if not I do them in my two hour dinner break when I have finished my dinner, I go home for my dinner because it works out cheaper. We live in Argentina. Behind our house their is alot of country-side, often on a sunday afternoon we go for a walk in the contry. The observertry I work at is two miles away and the nearest villiage is * 3 miles away from the observertry and five miles away from our house but we have 2 cars between our family.  Words: 209
