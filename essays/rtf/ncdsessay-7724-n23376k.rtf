When I am twenty five I will get a shop of my own. I think I would like a sports shop. The reason I might get a sports shop is because I am interested in sport. My interests are football and gold, but mainly I like football. At home I colect stamps and I go to [town] football matches at the weekend. I go cycling nearly every Sunday. I go for walks with my brother and the dog. I like reading books at home and at school. I go to the pictures sometimes. When I have my holidays I sometimes go over to [town] where I used to live, the reason I go over there is to see my friends.  Words: 120
