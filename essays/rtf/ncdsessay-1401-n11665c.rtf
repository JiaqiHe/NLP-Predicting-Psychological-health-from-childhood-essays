I am 25 years old and I feel that I am a real grown up. Having a big car like a Ford Galaxy. I go to work every day. I go to the station and leave my car and get on a train to London.
When I get to the office I hear people saying hello to me and people talking.
When I becomes Sunday I get and have my breakfast. When I get dreased I went down to the river where I sailed my speed boat. I have lunch and then go for another sail and then dive off and have swim. we all go back home and in the evening I have a glass of Gin and tonick. I go to bed at about 10.30. 
When I get up the next morning I go to work again.  Words: 137
