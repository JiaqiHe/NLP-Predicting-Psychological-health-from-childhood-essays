I have just had my twenty-fith Birthday. I am married, I own a car. A few days ago we moved in a four bedroom house at [address].
      I work as a police-man driving a pander car up and drown roads, when I am on duty. In my spare time, I have a house-boat which my wife and I go to at weekends.
      The last few weeks I have been doing up the house , painting and gardening. Soon I hope to have a pond, in the garden.
      A few days ago a had a letter asking if I would mind help* a party of skin divers which have* Shurch for a plain which chisd in to the sea so far we have only found the cockpit of the plain and a right wing and engins.  Words: 135
