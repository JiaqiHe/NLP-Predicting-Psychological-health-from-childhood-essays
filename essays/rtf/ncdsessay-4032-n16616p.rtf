My home is in a seaside town called **** it is a very nice place and I enjoy living there. My house has three bedrooms, a kitchen, a living-room, a dining room, a bath-room, a toilet and a hallway. Thegarden is fairly big and we grow a lot of flowers in it. It is a very pleasent life and I enjoy every moment of it. I make nearly all my dresses and knit quite a lot of jumpers and cardigans. I also like every moment of my job and do the very best to satisfie the customers. I also like watching television and listening to the radio and sometimes in my spare time I write poems. Sometimes I write short stories to pass the time away.  Words: 151
