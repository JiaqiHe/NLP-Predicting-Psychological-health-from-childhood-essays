----------------------
I am twenty - five years old, I live in one of a row of fifty houses. there is a cinema in the middle of the town, which, as I am not far away from it I am able to go to frequently.
I work at the nearby school during the dinner hour and I have a part-time job as an assistant in the grocer's shop. just across the road from my hoeuse. 
At the weekends I often go for the weekend into the country with my tent and all my camping equipment. This I do on my own as I very much enjoy being isolated for a four days and even though I live in the heart of a town I don't go out with other people a lot.
Another thing I enjoy which is really my favourite hobby is riding. I have a horse of my own which my sister (who is lucky enough to be livin in the country) looks after for me. I often have my horse out for a long ride, but at other times my sisters groom feeds and exxercises him.
Altogether I lead a very happy life and I don`t think I will ever want to change my home or for that matter anything else.
