My name is Mr [surname] and my age is twenty five. I am training to be an Astronomer. I have studied a list of the Solar System, the Sun, Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Neptune, Saturn, Uranus and Ploto. I spend most of my time listening to lectures and discussing my work with other younge astronomers. Some day I may write a book about my work that people may read. I go to work in my helicopter which lands on the top of the building. My wife is a year younger than me and we have four children. There names are [female name], [female name], [male name] and [male name]. My wife works in a shop and a neighbour looks after the children. We have a washing machine which even dries all the cloths. Nealy all the food we buy is frozen as none of the shops sell fresh meat, fruit, or bread as they did when I was a boy. The eldest child [female name] geos to school and learns about the new coins and the new measures. She hase never herd of shillings or halfcrowns.
I love to take my family out in the car at the week ends. The roads are much wider than they used to be when I was a boy.  Words: 215
