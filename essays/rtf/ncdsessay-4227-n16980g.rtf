I would be an enginer and have a flat. In my spear time I wound paint and sell pictures. I also would like a boat to live and retire in. Join the Navy and sail around the world. I would cook and mend. I would have to lok after the family bring in money to keep. By food, clothes, beds, blankets, and that for the house. A garden to run and grow veges like carrots, peas, beans and potatoes. The worst would be deckerating. I would had to do makcanecall things. I would probable think of my-self on a boat on a lake. But standing at a machen most of a day. The garden would have a wall at the back and behind that a orchard. The house would be an manshon. One tree would have no apples only branches so that they could play up it. Mountains would be all around it.  Words: 153
