My name is [name] and I am married and have one child. I live on the [estate] and work in my family's Sweet shop. I work in the shop Seven 'O' clock till 6 'O' clock (I have a break) We have got a mini car. On Sundays I go out with my Mom Dad and husband also my one year old daughter named [name]. My mom and dad live with me and help in the shop. We go on holiday every year and last year we went to Spain. In a few months time we are going to emigrate to Australia With my mom and dad and [name] will stay with Mom and I will go to work we have already got jobs to go to and we are selling the shop soon. We will have a lot of money for the shop. But still some of it belongs to Mom and Dad. We sell a lot of things in the shop and make a profit. We are selling it to a man called [name]. My daughter [name] is very happy here but we think she will like it better in Australia. I have a friend who lives next door here name is [name] she is married and has two children a boy and a girl aged one they are twins. It is nice living on the Estate with the flats houses and shops all around you it is very quiet on the roads but buses pass in front of the house and they make a bit of a noise. The houses on top of the shop are very modern with Central heating and modern Utensils. It is three bedroomed and [name] has got her own. I will be sorry to leave the Estate but it will be nice flying over to Australia.  Words: 304
