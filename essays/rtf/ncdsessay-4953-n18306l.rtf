I am a professional footballer and I play for ****. I have been with them two years now. In the next two weeks we are playing in the Fa. cup final at wembley. I am the goal keeper for the team and we been training all week. The final is Against ****. I became a profesional in 1976 and worked my way up from the third division. where I played for **** when they were runners up in the **** final, Where we got beat Three, one by ****. I have played in six cup finals and won four of them. There was one final I will never foreget where there were three men sent of for fighting over a penalty. In the end a penalty was given and it was hit wide. Our new manager has fetched* us to the top of the lueage and now the cup final. I can remember last year when I got my leg broken, trying to clear the ball. I banged my leg on the post. I want to win this final to collect my fifth cup winners medal to Put with the rest of my trophies. We gat Three England caps and one footballer of the year award which I treasure very much in my callection. Because I only got it last year. I am married, with a young boy who I hope will follow in my footsteps. I like football because my father used to be the manager of ****. Who have one the cup once in 1970. Then my father retired from football but be started* to trainme in good and that is how I got to be a profesional.  Words: 280
