If I were 25 years old I would try and do interesting things. Such as Ski-ing water ski-ing, and I would try to visit places of interest. I would be an engineer draughtsman. In my spare time I would go motorbikeraceing and push-bike raceing. At home I would help my father and mother out with money problems and other such things, and if I ever reached the top of my proffeshen or owned something I would try to get my father an esay job. If I wanted to get married I would first enjoy myself and do all the things that I had ever wanted to. I do not think that I will join the army or anything like that when I'm grown up. If I did get a good job I would try and save as much money as I could. I might settle down and have a family but I am not quite sure yet. I think if I did not have a family I would either get a house of my own or live with my mum and dad. I do not think I would emigrat to another countrey. I would stay in England If I did have a family I would try and give my children the best education I could give them, and if I own anything and I got too old to run it I would hand it over to them. And just sit back and supervise what was going on.  Words: 247
