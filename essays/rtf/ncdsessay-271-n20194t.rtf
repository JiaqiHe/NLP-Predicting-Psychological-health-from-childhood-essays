I am an art teacher. Each morning I go to the school and prepare the lessons. I live near my parents in the country in a small cottage. It has a lovely garged and veiw. The lounge is small, but the kitchen is large. After school I often go to the nearby tennis club for a game of tennis or to the swimming baths. I like to go on walks in the country with my dog too. My work is quite hard, each day I get up at half past seven and get ready for eight o'clock and then get a lift into town. I prepare the things and then have two or three lessons before break. After break I go on with art till dinner and then continue on till quarter past four. Although my work is quite hard I enjoy it very much as I like art very much. I also like English and I like to read very much. I am very happy with the life I lead at weekends I play tennis and go swimming. Occasionly I go to a dance. I also like animals. I kept a dog, but had to submit that it stayed with my parents, for it would be cruel to have kept it the whole day in the house. I am also a great lover of flowers and the countryside. I like to go on the moors where the wind is refreshing and the heather carpets the ground. I enjoy myself very much just walking with my dog. In the summer I like to garden and I landscaped my garden myself, I am now going to make a water garden. I also enjoy driving, as I have just past my driving test I am hoping to get a car.
