I am twenty five years old. I am married and have two children. I have a home of my own. When I have spare time I would take my children fishing, or shooting or mayby out for a run in the car. On Saterdays I might sit down and watch T.V. or go some where. I have a pleasant job working  in the [factory] and I hope to stick to my work. I make frames for the pluggs. I hope to have good pay to buy furniture and things for the house. If I lost my job I would look for a new one and hope for more pay. When I earn enough money I will buy a garage for the car. When the holidays come my familly will go to the beach for a swim and I might go fishing* round the rocks. When I go back to my work I will try and work harder than I did before and get more pay.
