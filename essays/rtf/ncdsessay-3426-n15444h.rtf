If I was 25 years old I would get a job somewhere I would get married and have a hose of my own . at nights I would watch televison then read a book. In the morning I would get up for work . When I would come home at night I would put on the kettle and have a cup of tea or coffee and sit on the chair trying to finish my book . Then after I have read a few pages I would put away my book and watch television and after television I would go to bed and read my book . Then when I get up in the morning I would get up a bit erlyier and have a cup of tea and a roll and then I would go away to work.
