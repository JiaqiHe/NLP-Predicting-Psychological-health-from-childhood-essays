I now am leading a very expearianced life becaus I have just joined a new firm. The boss of the firm hardly ever canes in but I still work in the factory have a break at twelve and have my lunch. Then at four we have a mug of tea brought round for us. At six thirty we finish off and go home. Usually my wife has got a big dinner ready so that I can sit down and have it straight away. Then after that I can Sit down and watch television. Then at eight o'clock I go up to the bathroon have a shave and get into my* Suit and go down stairs again. I get into my ford Car and set off to the [pub] for a drink. The owner of the [pub] is called [name] and I know him very well. A nine o'clock I usually go out of the pub and meet some friends. I usually go sanewhere with them. A Eleven o'clock when all the pubs and hotels are closed I go home in my car. In the morning I usually hear a crackling get out of bed get washed then get dressed have my usual breakfast of Bacon and eggs. After that I usually set off to the factory for another days work  Words: 220
