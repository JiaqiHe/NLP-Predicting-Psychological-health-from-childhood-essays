I never go out later than 12 O clock. I like to make shore my children are always safe. Also in my spare time I like to wright poems. My life at home is sometimes very boring because there is only me in the house. The children are out most of the time and my husband is at work when I can get a holiday he cant. But when he can I cant sometimes it can be very boring indeed.  Words: 189
