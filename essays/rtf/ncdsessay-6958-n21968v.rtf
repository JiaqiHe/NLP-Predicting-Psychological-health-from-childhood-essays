When I am 25 years old I would like to get married. I would live in a cottage out in the country, or somewhere near the sea. I would like very much to be a nurse, because I am very interested in that sort of thing. I would like to have children because children interest me very much. I would try to lead a happy life. My interests would be reading, tennis and the way people dress. I would like to be very up to date in fashion. For my holidays I would like to go to Cornwall or Torquay because I have been told it is very nice down there I would not live to have more than three children because I do not like to have too many. My other interests besides being a nurse is being a teacher. I like a teachers work just as much as a nurses. I would like to learn to drive very much. Then I would be able to have a sports car I like going for runs in the country or going down by the sea. My home life would be happy and gay and I would not have or try not to have any arguements. My other interests would be sewing, like making clothes for my children and making dresses for myself When I went on holiday I would stay in a caravan. I would buy one and take it down to Cornwell Another interest would be food. I like food very much. For my breakfast I would probably have bacon egg and tomatoes. For my dinner potatoes, roast pork and cauliflower and for sweet lemon meringue pie. Then for my tea I would have chicken sandwiches.  Words: 287
