Every morning I will get up have my breakfast and then I will go to work. I work till 12 o'clock. I'll come home for lunch. I shall leave home at half past 1 to get to work at 2 o' clock. We have a break at about 5 o'clock. I shall have a cup of tea and something to eat. After we have finished and there is some time left we have a game of football in the winter and cricket in the summer. The place we work in is quite a big place. At the back there is a lot of grass. The grass is cut of by a fence. On the other side of the fence there is a football pitch. Our firm makes jumpers and socks. We have a football team. I play on the team. I play in goal for them. We leave off early on Tuesday. We leave off at 5 o'clock. Some other men take over our places. I go speedway on Tuesday. It is quite ex citing. On the other nights we watch television. On Saturdays I watch the sport in the afternoon. I work till noon. I get home just in time for dinner. On Sunday we go out. I can drive a car. Our car is a Courtina. We go to Blackpool for our holidays. We once went to Brighton. We go to nearly all the speedway match home and a way. When we have a football match on our home ground we always win the matches. We are top of the league.  Words: 263
