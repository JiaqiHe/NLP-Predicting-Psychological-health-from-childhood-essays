When I am at the age of twenty five I hope to be a perfeshenal carpenter I like the job because I like sawing and making the wood smooth I hope that I will be sent out on a job like mending door because if it is the door rubing on the floor I will know how to do it I will take the hinges of and then I will take a peice of the bottom of the door and make shure that I put the hinges on properly and I hope that the person in the house will ofer me a cup of tea and some biscutes with it and then I will say thank you and say good-by that will be the end of one job, But in one day I might be brought out on two - or three jobs a day I would have a mate who would come with me on a job we might have to fix the skurton on the wall. or I might have to fix a desk or a sideboard a settie would not be very hard because I hae seen on being put togethe at 10am I would have a mars and a few sandwitches and a cup of tea aswell. I would come home for dinner and I might have steak and chips at 1 30pm I would go back to work and I would work untill 7 30pm I would come home at 80pm and go to bed at 10pm I would be very tired before I go to bed and before that I would have a cup of tea again just before getting into bed and the kiss the wife before I get into bed and then I would sleep peace-fully  Words: 294
