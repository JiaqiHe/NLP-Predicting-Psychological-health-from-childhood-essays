I am now 25 years old, I am a teacher at [school name] School. I go to the school on the 8.25 bus from [town]. I teach infant 1. First thing on monday morning I collect the dinner money. Then I get the children settled (Usually they play with the building bricks.) About half an hour later they usually get bored so I take them out for P.E until playtime. They have their milk and go out to play. After play they come in, then we have a writing lesson learning the children the alphabet. After dinner I let some of them go into the sand - and play. And the others do either painting or playing with plastersince. At night I go home have my tea and usually watch the television. This carrys on until Saturday, then I go shopping. At night I go the old Hall at [village] with my friends. On Sunday morning I go to [school name] Sunday School, because I am a teacher there. I really enjoy my work.  Words: 174
