I am now at work and I am a shop ascisdent, I go every day and come home about six oclock at night, and I start about nine oclock in the morning. I stay in when, I come home from work, I am not married, so I live with my mother and father and my little sister. On a saturday, I do some shopping for my mother, and I go to town with my sister, and on a sunday, I go out just for a walk, and in the morning I start work again, We do not have a day off all week except saturday's and sundays. I like being a shop ascisdent, because I like adding up, sometimes working the till, I get five pounds a week, but for my self it is good money, because I give two pounds of it to my mother, and I keep the rest to buy clothes or food. When I am older, I will get proberly more money, and I will be better off. Later on, I will be hopeing to get married, and get a flat or a house. But I won't give up my job, I will carry on and the two of us, will be earning money insted of just one, And will we be better off with the two of us.  Words: 223
