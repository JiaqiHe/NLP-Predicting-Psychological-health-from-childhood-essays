      When I reach the age of 25, I'm hoping that I have allready got a job for my self like engineering, or being a cheff. I would like to be a cheff because there is a lot of money in thise job. Also there is 5 to 10 years of trainig to be a cheff that is why I would like to be a cheff. I also said I would like to be a engineer. you still get about the same amount* of money being an engineer aswell as being a cheff so either job would do me for a job. At 25 I am going to have enough money to buy my owm house that would be mine I will not live there until I have save up enough money to buy some of my own faniture for the house and then I can live in the house or the house will be living worthy or habitable. I hope I will be living on my own at the age of 25 years old.  Words: 178
