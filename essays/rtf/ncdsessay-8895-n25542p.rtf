When I am 25 years old I wont to be a star footballer like Bobby charlton. Or I might wont to be a criketer, And I will save up and by a car. My best car. a cortina. If I cant be a footballer or a criketer, I might like to be a Gas man like my dad is. I dont want to get married I dont think, If I can would wont to live in Oxford or Norfolk. I like it there its were we go for our holidays, I like it because its more piceful. If I could I would try and get a farm because you will have plenty of things to do. At night than watch television, and mornings than lay in bed all morning. If I could not get a farm I would get a little cottage just the right sizes for me. And I would breed dogs like. labradors round the the back of the cottage. And I might keep a few hens and a cock to wake me up in the morning. And In the cottage I will brade budgies. I will make a garage for my car, And I will make a hen hoses for my hens.  Words: 205
