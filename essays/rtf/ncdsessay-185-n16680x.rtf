I am a school teacher I teached at St [xxxxxxx]'s school. I teached teach Drama, painting and I take children for swimming. I am very interested in Swimming and painting myself. I travel to school by car, because I live along way from schol. I am married and my husband works at a Grammar school for boys. At night time I get a book from the library and I read sometimes I go to the baths. At school I teach 30 children they are boys and girls of 12 year' old and 13 year's old. I do not over work them because I think that when you do they tend not to like you. One day I hope that I will be headmistress of my own school. When I give them some work I expect it to be very well done and that is why I also do not over work them. When you are headmistress or headmaster you have a lot of responsability and I would expect alot from my staff. When I am at home I make the meals and tidy the house up. I go shopping and I am 25 years old and my husband is 26 year' old. My name is [xxxxxxx] and at school they call the teachers miss and sir. My home life is very nice I sometimes go out in my car. My car to the country with my husband. We are soon going to move to London and I am going to be [xxxxxxx] my husband will be teaching at [xxxxxxx]. Now I am very busy at school and at school my staff and I work very hard. At home we are doing very well we are quite wealthy.  Words: 287
