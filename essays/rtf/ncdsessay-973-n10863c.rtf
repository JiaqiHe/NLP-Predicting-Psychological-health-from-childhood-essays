----------------------
I work in a laboratory making ladies make-up. I find this interesting because I like chemistery and I also like make-up.
When I get home in the evenings I have my supper, then read the newspaper or watch television. Then I go to bed and read a book for about fifteen minutes.
I am interested in people and they way they react to certain things. I also like drawing and painting. I have two pets, a golden retriver called Claudius and a Siamese cat called Tao Sie, Sie for short.
I sometimes go out in the evenings to the cinema or the theatre, I like 1930 style films. because of the fashions and the way the stars act.
I like modern fashions in clothes and furniture and I am quite interested in archetecture and I find archeology very interesting. 
I am interested in politics, but I think that the people concerned sometimes get a bit carried away with themselves. 
I am married and hope to have some children.  Words: 164
