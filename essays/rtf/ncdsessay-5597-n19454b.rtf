Im am 25 and. I am 25 years old and I write about what I am doing. My interests are worked working at home. sometimes I work as a secretary in a big building where I have a young boss. sometimes he help me to tupy a big letter for is frenid. But when I have finshed work I go out to the country side where we can see cows, sheep. Some times we give food to the animals. and sometimes a drink. But then we go for a ride on the horses. Then after we had our ride we had to go back home. when we get home we had to tidy it up. so we asked our nabours to help us to do the furniture. because the furniture was in a mess. So we started to clean the place up. Then after we cleaned it up we went to bed. At first I had to put my to babies to sleep. One baby was three and the other baby was only one years old. So after we put the babies to sleep we came to bed and went in to the bath-room. because my hands were dirty and my face. so I put water in the sink and started to wash me. The bath-room was yellow and white and we had roses for the wall paper. Then the next morning I had to get up early the was 6 past 7 because my husband had to go to work.  Words: 251
