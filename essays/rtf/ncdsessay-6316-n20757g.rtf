I am now at the age of twenty five years old. And i am in the royal navy, I am the captain of a cruiser. On teach trip we meet different people in different countries. I am unmarried, and every time we go somewhere we always manage to start a fight. But we always manage to win after a good belting and a few black eyes and busted noses. Every time we go to Hawaii we always find a few more fals and a few more women. But once we've got away from the island we were always depressed. There was one stormy night when we were caught in a typhoon, the ship rode the typhoon well and by dawn the typhoon had passed. And I was glad to say there was no-one hurt. But in the typhoon everything on deck was washed overboard into the dark murky sea. By nine oclock every-one was on deck. The we got to our quarters, and I went up to the bridge where the helmsman and the navigator were plotting our course. Our range from the nearest land was three thousand miles, we were travelling at fifty knots covering fourty miles a day. Then we ran into a school of wales, it was lucky for us because the flares scared them away. It was neary noon now and we had to radio for some new equipment to be brought, because it had been washed overboard in the typhoon.  Words: 245
