I am in the army I joind when I was 21. I am not maried. I am in the paratroop section I like it a lot more that anything else. I joind the army cadets when I was 13. I have not been overbraod yet even tough I would like to go overbraod. I have done about* 120 jumps at 2,000 feet of the ground and I have been to different staitions. The training is hard but I don't mind I like it. I have too jump over hard and marshy ground. Somtimes we jump over the sea in different depthes. I like a good fight now and again. You have too learn the drill of course. I hope to be posted over seas in africa I think I would like it there because of the heat. I like it hot because you can have a swim then and that I would like.  Words: 153
