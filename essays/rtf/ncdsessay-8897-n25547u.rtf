I still live in [town] and I have to go to Newcastle University at first I wanted to be a Member of Parliament like my Grandfather but I had other ambitions, I'd like to go abroad when I get the money I'm not poor but I'm not rich ether, I've been trieing to find a scientist so that I'd be apprentice to him I and I'd be a B.Sc and my real abition is to be a scientist ever since I was 10 year old I've wanted to be a scientist and now I've got the chance. I like Football and still I support Newcastle Utd, footballs going out now, Ive created a machine that will lift things by vibration Ive also discovered how to make things twice as strong  ie a piece of Cobolt, by making the molicules in straight lines therefore increasing its strenghth the molicules grip onto each other. I dont know the first thing about cars exept driving them every time it breaks' down I have to take it to Garage and it's expencive I remeber the time when sweets were sixpence a qtr now they'are 10 pence (New pence it's two shilling) the day are also geting colder in summer the temerature is 40' and in winter its terrible it really is.
