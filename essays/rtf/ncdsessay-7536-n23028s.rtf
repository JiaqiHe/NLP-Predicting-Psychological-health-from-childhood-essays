When I am 25 years old I shall be a Designer and artichiet. my hobbies will be, Rugby, swimming, coin-collecting and golfing. I hope I shall not be married, when I am 25 years old, I want to be a bachelor but I will have a lady that comes round every day except sunday and wednesday to do the housework for me. I will have two cars a volvo estate and a T.V.s. I will not have an enormously big house or a small one. I shall go to the crewe golf club every wednesday and sunday. I will have got some pets and I shall study fish etc. because I wont to be a naturalist. I will lead a life in which I shall spend a lot of money but not on silley things.  Words: 135
