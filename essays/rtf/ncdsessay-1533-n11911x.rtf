I am now 25, I am not married. I am still living with my Mother. I have a part time job as a teacher. I teach a junior class for morning lessons. I do most the work in the house I love cooking and I always cook when we have visitors. I make my own clothes, and when I am not making anything for myself I knit things for my sister who does not like knitting. I go out most evenings with friends. When I am not doing anything I take my mother out to bingo or for a drink. We have a tennis court in the garden so often I challenge my Father to a game tennis. I belong to a tennis club where I go every fortnight. I have a horse of my very own and I often go for long rides in spare time. I keep it in a stable not far from our house I have a dog of my very own it is 1 year old. I have a boyfriend but  a few weeks ago he flew to Austria and won't be back for another year. When I have nothing else to do I read books. I belong to a library in the next village. The first thing I do when I come home from work is cook my Mother's and my dinner. After that I help clear the things away. When all that is done I go up in my room and mark the childrens work. Which takes a good half an hour. The school I work at is over 4 miles away so I go by car. I have my own car. The car is a blue mini.  Words: 285
