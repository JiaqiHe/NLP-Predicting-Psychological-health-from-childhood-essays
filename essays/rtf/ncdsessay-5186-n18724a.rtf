----------------------
I live in an old half-timbered house in Oxfordshire. At the back of this house are the stables. We have a hunter, 16.2h.h, called Baron, Heron, an event horse, and Sonny, the little Shetland-Dartmoor pony I learned to ride on. My husband is an M.F.H (Master of foxhounds) and owns Baron. I own Heron (when he is not in three-day events I jump him).
   My greatest ambition was to ride at Badminton.
      Now this wish has come true. I was leading, with a score of 25.5 penalty points, at the start of the cross-country. Now I had 26.0 and was nearly finished. I urged heron on, over the rail, through the coppice, over the Irish Bank, over the hill and down into the lake, up the bank like a trained commando, and over to the finish.
      One day later, after the dressage as*, we waited for the results. They come, I've won the Badminton Horse Trails! I went over to Princess Anne to recieve the silver bowl, my knees knocking. 
      Then I have to load the horses and go home, weary, exultant and aching. 
      What a life! hard yet rewarding, I coulde'nt bear an office job! So I'm sticking to horses!
Now back to the orgy of cooking, grooming, mucking out, exercising, cleaning tack, feeding, and other tasks. With children it will be terrilble! I have no time for hobbies, only the odd read, game of golf or tenniss.  Words: 240
