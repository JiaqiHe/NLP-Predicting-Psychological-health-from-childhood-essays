Now that I am twenty five I am a maried most of the time I work on the farm that I own it is only a small farm and I only had one man to help me and we manige quite well. The few cows that we have dont give us milk. I also keep a few pigs for their meat. The two main crops I have are corn and potatos the main kind of corn is Barley. I plant about twenty acre of majester's and another twenty acre of pilot potatos. Half of my land is grassland for the cows to move* about in and is also for hay to feed the cows with in the winter when they are in the foldyard. In the field I grow some mangles that are given to the cows also in the winter. In my spare time I do some gardening, In the garden I mostly plant vegetables but on the borders I have some wall flowers and other plants. The other end of the garden is a mass of fruit trees and weeds. In the yard there is a saw bench and I use it to saw logs for the house this is another one of my spare time jobs. On a wet day I still go utside but I mostly talk to someone to keep. In a after noon I have a sleep befor I go outside and at night when I sit down I many a time drop off to sleep. My main hobby is coin collecitng I also collect some stamps.  Words: 263
