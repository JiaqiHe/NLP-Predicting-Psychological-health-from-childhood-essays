Now i'm twenty five I work at a bank. It is quite a good job and I enjoy it. I am married and I have got two children, one boy, one girl. I live in a house in hampshire, with some marvelous neighbours. My wife loves travelling and so do I, as when I was 23 years old I went on a world tour. I married my wife when I was 22 and she was 19. We have two young children, Caroline and Jeremy. We go out quite a bit, often to a cinema or a play. I am not poor and not rich I suppose I am inbetween, but I live a good life. Our house is on a nice plot, rather large, peice of land. I appreciate good food and I like, very much, gardening. We have got a modern car as I always try to keep up to date. Im the cashier in the bank and on very freindly terms with the bank manager I love football just like I did when I was eleven years old. Sometimes I go to a football match with my freinds, while my wife looks after the children.  Words: 197
