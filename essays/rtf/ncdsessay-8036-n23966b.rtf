I am twenty five years old, I go to football every week and I like it very much. When I do go to play football I have to go a very long way because I play for [football club] and I live in [town]. I also like swimming to help me grow bigger and stronger. I go to work in the middle of [town] at a shop called [shop] were any who one comes in who is a [football club] soporter rushes up and asks me for my atargragh. I have a very nice house in [town] which is just at the end of [road]. I have got three cars and a motor bike which I use very often to get through [town]s traffic. The cars are called jenson. capri and a jagua.
      On friday nights a go to bed at eleven o'clock because in the morning I have to get up very early and go to open my shop and then I close it at one o'clock so that I can go quikly to where I am going to play football because if I am late a I might even be fired for being late because there are lots more reserves who would love to go on the pitch and play against other teams than to play a five aside match against themeself and to have to sit with the boss when ever we play and wait until someone gets a injured and the they can go on and play.
