"My home is just out of ****. I am usually at u***versity. Now and then I have a break from university. When I do have a break I go home and usually do some gardening. Sometimes I go sailing on Barton Broad (I catch a train to Norwich then go by bus to the broad. I have got a free boat called ""SWEALTSJE"" pronounced swellchy. She is a whiteboat and she is famous because she wins alot. (on Barton Broad). When I do the gardening I usually by some flowers or sometimes* some Cacti i plant the cacti in the green house which is at the back of the house. In winter I skate on a pond. That is if the ice is thick enough. Out of 5 winter you can skate on the pond about 3 times. Also in winter I help the town children to make a huge snowman about six feet tall. I always try to help them because it make them happy and m*rry, mind you the thought of Christmas coming up makes them happy. I like to see people happy. I play criket for my college and I field at scilly* midonoroffor at 2nd slip sometimes. Now and then I play in a match against other colleges in Cambridge.
