I have one child she is two years old I take her up to her grandmothers every day as I work in an ofice and cannot take children There I got married when I was 20 years old to a man who worked as an electrition at a place called - '[company]' he likes his work very much just as I do. When I have Saturdays & Sundays off I like to take my little girl out Somewhere for a chang of scenery as she gets very board sometimes just watching the cars whize past*     house allday. My husband and I also like to have food out p**    *y at chinese restraunts because we think that it tast's better than English food. I keep two cats as they are my favourite animals and I have a little fish pond at the bottem of the garden. I like children very much especialy when they are young because they look very sweet in there little tiny clothes and they are very - play full. Me and my husband would like to have another child but my doctor said it would be best to wait until my little girl is three and the she will be old enough to learn not to feel to left out. I do not live in a house but I live in a small bungalow I have all of the nessesary furniture that I need and my husband has made me very comfertable indeed he gives me six pounds house keeping money which is more than enough for food and drinks so sometimes I can by him or myself something new to were.
