Today I went to work like any other day as a car tester it is great and I am still interested in pets and I nowhave a hamster farm in [town] and my father owns new agents in [town] also and I now have leaned to play the paino owing to the Rector of [church name] [London area] for I was once a choir boy there. Its nice to be at an age where you can go out on your own at night and you can realy be trusted and do things which you had not been able to do when you were young. Today I finshed work at 4pm and then I went to my hamster farm and to my surprize there was three new hav dozen hamsters been born and when I got home I went exploring the cliffs and after that I went fishing when I got home my father told me to help out with the papers and magazinges for Saturday when I had 200 more magazines then we were surpoes to have and we had to ring up and asked them to pick them up. Thursday morning about ten pm. I had a chance of testing a Ford Caprei and some racing cars In the after noon about 5pm I went out in the car for a drive and saw a person with hair down to their sholders and I was not sure if it was a boy or a girl.
