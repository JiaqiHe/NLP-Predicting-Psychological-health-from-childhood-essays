At seven o'clock I get out of bed get dessed and go to work at the laboratories. I live in a house no.6. with three bedrooms I live with my parents. When I get to the laboratries I have to do some research work on a mouse that has got one leg shorter than the rest. There is a laboratory next to my office. The laboratory has six cabinets with a table three two yards and a sink next to it. One cabinet for the apparatus and three for the chemicals. one cabinet for the chemicals in boxes and another one for the chemicals in bottles, all the cabinets are next to each other. At twelve o'clock it is lunch time and there is a cafe down the road. In the afternoon at 1 o'clock work starts again and everyone goes back to their office to begin their work. At six o'clock work ends for the day. I get into my car and go home again. When I get in I take off my coat and hang it up in the wardrobe. At half past ten I go to bed. The bedroom is square it has a long window my bed is two feet away from the window. The wardrobe is opposite my bed the door is painted blue. When I have had my wash and got ready for bed I get in turn out the light and go to sleep.  Words: 241
