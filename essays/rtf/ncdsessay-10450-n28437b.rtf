----------------------
I am 25 years of age and I am living comfortably at home. I am married but have no children. my job is a hairdresser because I did not pass my G.C.E. Iam regulary busy with my work and not a lot spare time. At the moment I have a flat in Wales and I am waiting to move to a house. I am interested in cats and I have three. I also go an ice rink in London twice a year, to watch the ice skating I am planning to go to spain for my summer holiday. Sometimes I hardly have anyone at the hairdressing salon. I rarely get time to read a newspaper. I have two bedrooms in my flat I polish the furniture once a day. Sometimes when people come in to have their hair dressed they make a fuss and try and start an arguement, I really feel like giving them a piece of my mind. I usually do a lot of sewing, knitting and washing clothes. I also do a lot of cooking. I often let Janet Murray a little girl, take out patch my dog. One of my cat has six kittens and another of them is due to have some. I dress my own hair.  Words: 212
