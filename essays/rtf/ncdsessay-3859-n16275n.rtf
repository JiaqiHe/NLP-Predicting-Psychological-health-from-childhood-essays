I own a riding stable out a [location] I like this kind of life. On a Thursday I go to a Pony Club meeting I am manager. We live only a litle way away from my riding stable. I often help my mother because she gets pains in her back my father helps me run my riding stables I charge 10/-. On Saturday evenings I go out with my boyfreind, in the morning I sometimes take the ponies and some riders to a gymkana (if there is one) Once a month I go to Herts to a Horse Sale to see if there are any reasonable ponies for sale.
      Sometimes one of my ponies go sick so I have to run up the road to the vet. My kind of life is hard but I enjoy it.  Words: 137
