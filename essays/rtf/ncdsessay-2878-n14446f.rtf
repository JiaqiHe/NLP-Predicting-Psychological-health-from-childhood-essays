I am twenty five and I work at Regents Park zoo. I am not married. My job involves feeding the monkeys, the elephants, teaching the seals and the dolphins. I live in a flat not far from the zoo. My hobbies are playing chess and tabletennis, I like swimming to. Some days I ride on elephants. I have a pet dog to keep me company at night. I get about thirty five pound a week it realy depens on how much work I do. I have four weeks holiday plus when I am ill I can stay at home. I am saving up for a yacht so I can sail around the British isles. I like the li*e I am leading. and I am quite content.  Words: 126
