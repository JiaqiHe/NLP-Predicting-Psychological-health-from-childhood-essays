The life I am leading is a happy one at work but at home there are prodlems there are bills to pay two children to feed so the only thing to do is to git a beter job so down to the employmet office I had to go to git a beter job I got one in a compyuter office where the money is good and soon the bills where paid. The one thing that I was interested in was wood work I had made alot of sheves at school and so I was handy around the house I made cupboreds and shelves and alot of other things.
