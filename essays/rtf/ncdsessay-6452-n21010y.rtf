I lead quite an interesting life. I am married , but have no family. I work at the (place). I earn a good wage and everyone there is very friendly. I still enjoy swimming , reading , knitting and sewing . I stay at home quite often apart from friday and Saturday night. I often visit my mother and father though, and help them around the house. I still enjoy caring for animals and have two dogs . They are alsations and are both two years old . I bought them just a few months before I got married . They are very playful , but well trained. We often go picnics on Sunday afternoons and return in the evenings . Sometimes when the weather is very nice my parents go too. During the week we sometimes have visiotrs and in the summer my cousins from Wales come to stay with us for a few weeks. So altogether I lead a very pleasant life .  Words: 165
