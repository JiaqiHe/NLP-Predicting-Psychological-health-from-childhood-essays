----------------------
At the age of twenty-five my interests are langages. I go to classes every week and quite enjoy them. I learn French, German and Spanish. I like French the best and am quite good at it
My work is as a shorthand-typist. The office I work in is in Buckinghamshire nr. London. It is not a permanant job for soon I hope to go into training to be an airhostess.
When I am at home I do a lot of sewing for myself and my newly married husband. At the week-ends sometimes I go to dances and a ball evrey few monthes. I have many friends that live near me. Some times I go for walk in the woods near by.  Words: 119
