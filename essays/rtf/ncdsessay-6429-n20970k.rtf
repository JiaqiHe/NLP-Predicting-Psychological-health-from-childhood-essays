It is my birthday and I am twenty five years old. I was looking forward to this day because it is the day that my collage ends. My intrests will have been at college and now I will have'd to find some more. My intrests might be a guider and go out on a certian day to take girl guides out. Take them on camp and hikes. I would have a bungalow to live in with my husband (If I am married) and when I am about twenty seven I will have my first baby. If I live collage at the age of twenty five I would wait untill I had all the babys I wanted and then get a occupation. The occupation would depend on the corse I took at colllage. I might even set up my own buissness at home. That is when my children are old enough to look after themselves when they come home from school. If I was a hairstyalist and I lived on a estate I would set my own work up. But if I lived nearer the town I would work at a hairdressers. Many years before I was twenty five, at the age of seventeen I would take driving lessons and learn to drive. If I worked near but not to far away from town I could walk to town. But if I could not set my own work up and I lived along way away form town then being able to drive will be advantage to me.  Words: 256
