When I'm a25 years old I will be working and wont be doing dishes at home. I will have pay or wages(The beat) I would like to be a fireman or a doctor. I would really like to be a cook I can make fancy cakes and jellies. I would save up and by a motor car called a Rover 2000. another thing is a shcool teacher hitting all the children with one big leather strap and cane. I would travel to places India, England, Wales, and of course (place) and see all the rockets. another thing is a joiner but I dont fancy getting my finges bashed with hammers. I would like to be a st********* and climb high mountains but the only thing that would worry me is incase I fell. Well now my job is going to be a cook I can just smell the nice cakes, cream buns, dumplings, pies. I maybe get a job in a big store like the one down in (place). I would like to get a skycraper in (place) too  Words: 179
