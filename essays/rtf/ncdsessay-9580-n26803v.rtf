I came down stairs to cook my breakfast. I was very pleased with the knew flat I had bought. After break-fast I washed my things up and I got ready to go to college. I was to have my e******** that day and I had the butterflys. I wanted to be an infant school teacher. I took my exams and I was told that I could be a teacher. 
I went home and I made my entrace to go to (place) school. I got in and I was very pleased. About a year later I got married and I move right near (place) school. After I had been there three years 2 mothes I had a baby. It was a little girl. When she groow older she had riding lessons and so did I. I soon got to like horse riding and I bought a horse for my daghter and I had one two. We went on long rides together. I had a very happy life when I was in my 20's.  Words: 172
