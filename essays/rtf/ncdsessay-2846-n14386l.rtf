When I am 25 I would like to get married. We would go on holiday nearly every year to see different sights and different places. I would also get a car for to go and visit my relatives. We could travel around in the car. I would like to work in a shop serving because I like meeting different people each day. If I had a family I would not be able to do all these different things but in my spare time I could go to Mothers Union or I could go to cookery classes because I like doing cookery very much. I sometimes do cooking at home for my mother and many other things for my mother as well. While the children are at school I'd have to clean the house up before I could go to Mothers Union or any other places.  Words: 145
