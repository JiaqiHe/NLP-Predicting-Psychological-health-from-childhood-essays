I am now 25 years of age I am not married I have not got any children I stop at home and look after my dad. The work which I am doing now is in an office I work from 8-30am in the morning to 4-4 5pm at night. I have a lot of interests in life I like reading, sewing knitting and other things like that. The life I am leading now is a good life the job I do is working out the wages for the people at work. The wage i get now is a good reasonable wage and I am very pleased with it. I do a lot of things around the house now I like cooking our meals going, to lauderette* to do our washing. I think my life at 25 is a good one.  Words: 140
