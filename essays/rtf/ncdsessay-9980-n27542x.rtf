I am working in an office and I am part. time footballer it is good working in an office because there is nobody to disturb me. And the football team I am playing for is (team) they are top of the first division. I am married and have one son . I sometimes play cricket with him. Every thing in the shops have gone up. so it is very hard for some people to buy the things they need. But it is okay for me because I am well paid. I have many freinds in the street And I am hardly ever bored. My son and I both like reading so I buy a book each every week. There are some football teams for children and my son for one of them. When he grows up he is hoping to play full-time for (team) . I have a pretty big house but the rest is to dear so I think I shall change it for a smaller one.  Words: 168
