----------------------
I am married and have a family of my own. I am working as a vet in a small town and am getting on quite well. I work 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Although I have got a good job I have got as much spare time as I would like. I still enjoy swimming and sometimes I swim for the town while my wife deals with any calls. I am on the board of directors for the school.
Previosly I had been at university studing animal medicines. I was called out many times in the middle of the night to see to worried pet owners. Many times I am called out to see pets and all they have is a slight cold. I am now going to tell you about one of these times. It was the middle of February and it was blowing a gale and the rain was pouring down. I had just come back from seeing someones dog and was dripping wet. I was late in getting to bed and no* sooner had I done so than I was called out to see an old ladies cat. She lived by herself right out in the countryside quite far from my house. I lazily got up and staggered to the car. When I got to see the cat it had nothing but a few scratches which the owner called big scars. In the end I was able to get some sleep. Although I have nights like this I still like my job  Words: 258
