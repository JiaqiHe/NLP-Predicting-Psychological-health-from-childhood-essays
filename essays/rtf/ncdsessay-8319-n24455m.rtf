I am an Profesional Footballer. I play for [football club] Myself and my wife and my two children live on the outskirts of [city]. We are at the ground for 8'O'clock every morning for a hard training session. Although it is very hard work I enjoy it very much. Every Thursday Afternoon is a free period. Some players read there fan mail others have a drink but I usually have a session in the games room. If there is an midweek match my wife and the two kids come and cheer us on. The bungalow in which we live is about 4 1/2 miles from the ground. We have a dog named Skip and he always gives me a warm welcome even if we've lost. Our two boys are soccer crazy. I've got one F A. Cup winners medal 3 English Cups and I won the footballer of the year award this year. This year we reached the Semi Finals and were beaten 1-0. We run supporters clubs up and down the country. I get xxxx35 a week and xxxx1 extra if I score. My wife doesn't go out to work as she has to look after the children. It is an interesting job and I enjoy it very much.  Words: 210
