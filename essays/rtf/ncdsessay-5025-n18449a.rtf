Every morning at half past eight I wake up very tired for I do not go to sleep till after two o'clock the night before . I am an electrican , my job is a dangerous one for if I make one wrong move or pull one wrong wire I could have thousands of bolts running through my body. M y favourite intrest is assembling modle aeroplanes **** which are remote controlled . I live in (place) in England . Being an* electrician i ** **** and install plugs and wires which lead to the the main circuits **** I install the wires in telephones and I put in lights. W hen I come home at eight thirty in the evening I have my tea ** and watch the television which I fixed in myself . M y house is not like any other house because practicly every other thing in the house is electronic . The **** **** electricity the television is switched on by remote controll . The windows do not open out the lift up automaticaly . I in***lled all this myself. On saturdays I would go sailing.
Sometimes I go flying but when its raining I stay in . On sunday nights I go dancing with my girl friend . My first wish is to marry and settle down with a family .  Words: 226
