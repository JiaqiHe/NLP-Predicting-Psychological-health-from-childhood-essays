When I am 25 years old I will live in [xxxxxxx]S and I would get up in the morning and tidy up the house. I will get married and start off with a small flat and when I get my money from work I would put 10% away for a week for a new house than if I have got the money for the house my husband and I will buy it then I will still have 10% for colths because if I go round the shops and see a dress or hat then I know I had the money to buy it. When I had got more colths then I started with, I would have 1 or 2 children and dress them up smart and I would like them to be good at sport, when one of my children are first born I will knit so they can have lovely cloths. In my husband and I house I would like a big garden so our children can have pets like a dog, cat or a bunny. rabbit. So they know how to look after pets before I have children I would spent most of my time to my house making cloths and my job. I would like to get married in white, and after my wedding have a big party and it will go on till the next morning.  Words: 230
