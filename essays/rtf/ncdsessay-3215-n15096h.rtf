When I am twenty-five years old I think ill be married and have two children. I work at the Co op as a design draughtesman. Apart from that I play football for a local amatuer club. and often play golf. My wife is someone who wants to enjoy life like me. The children are a boy and a girl. The boy will be oldest of the two. The reason I work as a design draughtesman is that my dad works there and he got me in the firm. I should be earning about thirty pounds a week. I like to see places and so we are going abroad this year. for our holidays I play football every saturday for a club and we are in a small league. Also I watch football and my team is Manchester United. Every time the amateur club is not playing I go to watch United. My son goes when he can and sometimes the rest of the family go to watch. We joined a golf club and I play when I can. My wife has joined the social club at the golf club, and every Friday night we go down for a drink. and a chat. You could say our family likes sport.
