I am married with an house of my own. My husband goes out to work every day exept for holidays, while I have a job of my own. When I arrive home from work I clean up, and make dinner. Afterwards I do any shopping that I need While my husband reads the newspaper. I then do a bit of knitting. I read the paper and watch the telivision. Sometimes I have an early night, because I have to rise very early in the mornings, because I run an hairdressing shop. In the the morning I clean clean the shop when I arrive there, and I warm it up ready for people come in to make apointments. and for those already with an apointment. When the shop is closed I just take it easy at home  Words: 136
