I am a bachaler and I live in a bungalow I have quite a reasnable pay. I am very happy at my work I am working in (name of place); at the moment I am studying the (name of animal) which at the moment not much is known. I work for the (name of place) who are based in the (name of place). I have quite a number of pets I have two crocodile's and a wombat which I have tamed my self. One of my hobby's is surfing which I do whenever I have free time, I usally drive out of town for this in a medium sized American car painted white which deflect's the sun Acsully I was very lucky when I was nearly twenty because I was nearly picked to go in the army. Acasunlly I go in the out back with a friend in his land rover, this is another of my pastime's which I enjoy because it is so peaceful. At home I have a fair sized garden with a pool in it, I have quite a few large buches and flower's in the garden which have to be dipped and waterd reguly. The house has two bedroom's a batheroom, a large liveng room an dining room and a kitchen. Built on to the side of the house is a car port. My bungalow is two mile's away from the city centre which is very handy.  Words: 241
