I live in a little cottage in the country and I often take walks across the feld with my dog . Every day I take out my knitting a get on with it while my cat and dog sit on the mat beside the fire . at night I sit down and watch television . I love to do my own hair instead of going to hairdresser . after my weeks holiday I go back work as a nurse which is very interesting and I meet many people . I do not need to wory about coming home at night for I have my own blue car . I like making clothes for my friends and knitting them jumpers sometimes the cat get tangled up in my wool and I have to cut the wool off him . Every Monday night I take a needlework class for girls between eight and fourteen. Sometimes I do girls hair *** that **** them going the hair dresss .
Every Sunday i go up to my sisters for my dinner and I help her do some of the housework .
Every year I go camping with my older brother who is twenty - nine .
As a nurse I get plenty of friends and when we finish work we go out together to the cinema .
In the after noon I go out shopping and by things for the week .
I also help a budgie which is named after my friends budgie (name) and my cats name is (name)
There is a farm near my house were I get eggs and milk from the farmers wife . In the summer I like to go and pick flowers which grow near . My hours as a nurse are 8am - 8pm which are not very much so I have plenty time to do what I want and I have a two hour break for dinner .  Words: 317
