I'm a librarian, and I tidy the shelves and take the books in, and if people have had a book over the day's limited they have to pay a fine and I take that in as well or another thing I do is the enquiries if people dont know where a book is I have to show them the shelf or if they want a book of tickets so they can draw a book out I give them one. 
My intrests are mostly reading but I like cooking and going to dances and parties, and I like looking after tiny babies.
My home life is rather hard because I've got to try and do the house-work before I go to work at 9 o'clock and then the four children are no help all they do is mess it up once I've tried to tidy it up 
The life Im leading is quite hard as well, because my husband has to go to work, come home for his dinner, and in fact he has to get his own sandwiches because I'm nearly always at work during dinner hour or when ever I do come home I'm alway's doing the house work. So it's a hard life when your about twenty-five because youv'e got the children to look after and then there's always work waiting for you, to tell the truth the only time I get time to read is when the children have gone to bed and sometimes in the libary, I know you may think thats awful reading in the libary but some times thats the only break I get.
