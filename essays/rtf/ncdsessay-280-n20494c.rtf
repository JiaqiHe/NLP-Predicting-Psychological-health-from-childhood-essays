'Hello Joan', 'I will be going out to night'.'It will be a change to get away from this desk my fingers are sore from useing the typriwter and the clacking gets on my nerves'. When I arrivide home I dashed round trying to be ready for when my boy freind comes. I got all in a mess with my make up and was not ready for my boy freind when he came to collect me. I soon I arrivide at a party the dresses people wear had bright orange on mixxed in with puprle my dress was flashy but not as bad as theirs. Suddenly every one stopped turned round and stared at me quickly I hurryed out with my boy freind behind. I walked up to a sket and sat down it was a dazy night with a dozey moist atmosephere lurching round me. Every thing was still as though I was looking at a painting till a bird flew out of its hiding place. Branches swayed in the twilight the sent a moon beam on to the rose making it brust into petals. My boy freind came up to me and sat down besides me what a glourise night.  Words: 201
