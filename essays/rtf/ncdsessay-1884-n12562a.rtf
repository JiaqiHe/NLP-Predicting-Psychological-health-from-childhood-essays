----------------------
Every week day I go off to the school where I work. When I get home I cook myself a meal. Some times I sit down to eat and listen to the raidio. Other times I make small modles to decorate my house with. I do alot needlework Making things such as cushion covers, tray cloths and dresses.
At the school I teach ten to eleven year olds. I like working at the school. Every morning I have my breakfast. and get out my car and drive to school. If it is nice at the weekends I go out for a walk up in some hills for the day, but if it is wet or cold I stay at home. Sometimes I cook a cake. Othertimes I do some washing.
Out of my pay I put about an eighth of it in the bank to save for a holiday.
I am leading a happy life. sometimes I go and sit in the garden and watch the birds coming to eat the scraps which I put out for them. I have a medium sized garden and a gardener who looks after it for me.  Words: 190
