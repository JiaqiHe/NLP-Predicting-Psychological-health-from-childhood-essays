"""I am now a perfeshenal Golfer,"" ""I START work at ten oclock, and finish teaching people at about 5.30 or 4.30"". After that I go home and see my wife and children in some of my spare time I teach my son to play Golf. That would last about 1 and half hourss then I would go and have tea. at about 8.30 my wife and I put children to bed. and spend the rest of the evening together. then we go to bed at about 10 oclock Our house is quiet lage we have 4 acres of land one swimming pool a tenis cought and a putting green. and we live in the tropics like barbados. And we enjoy our selves very much. If I had a holiday I would go maybe to where I went went when I was married or go to a place where I have never been before. If I had a chance on one of our holidays I would go sea fishing and I would tkae the family with me. The holiday would last at least 4 or 5 weeks and when we got home we got back to the same routine. The golf club I play and teach and sell at is by the sea, and it has and 18 hole course 9 hole course a practice ground and a putting green."  Words: 229
