I am living in [city] I am leading a very happy life. I go out to different places. I do ballroom dancing and hairdressing. I have a bugalow which is my own it has three bedrooms a dinning room a kicthen a bathroom and a toilet. I have two pets. I go to ballroom dances on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday Morning and Saturday I work at a hairdressing shop. I do not work hard at home because I do a bit everyday. I have furnished all the rooms, first of all when I come to live here I only had one bedroom furnished but now I have all the upstairs furnished and papered. I am having the dinning room furnished, carpeted and papered now and then it is all done. I have bought a piece of land around the bugalow. Where I have planted flowers and made a fish pond.
