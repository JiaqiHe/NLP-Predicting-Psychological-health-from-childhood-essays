I am going to try and get a job. I have been thinking about being a football but I do not no how to start. I watch football on television and see how the play. If I have nothing to do I would draw or paint pictures. In the morning I will go for walks. I sometimes go to the cinema to see war pictures. I like going to the races and bet on horses. I have been to football matchs. I pay two and six. Football is my best sport in the hole country but I still do not no wot I am going to be. On sunny days I go to the coast and get sunburnt. Day after day I think something. I no the town very well so I go there and get new things from the shops. I like riding on busses. I look out of the bus window and listen to the cars.  Words: 158
