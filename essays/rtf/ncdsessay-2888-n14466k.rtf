When I am 25 I hope to look after Horses or work in an office. I have always wanted to look after animals; so if I cannot look after horses I want to look after any animal. If I cannot work with animals I want to be a typist in an office. I want to be a typist because you get good wages and can go shopping and buy nice clothes and shoes. With animals you have to take them out for a walk in rain, snow or sunshine. Also I would like to work in a bank because I wouldn't have to go outside atall exept when I have to go home. When I get married I want to have 2 children both of them girls. One I would call [female name] and one [female name]. In the kitchen the floor would be covered in white tiles and the cupboards would be blue.  Words: 154
