I live in a detached house with my husband and little girl who is now a year old. I work as a barrister. My daughter is looked after by our maid. While I am at work. We go swimming every sunday and my daughter loves the water. Also we often for rides in the country. We have a lovely big garden with a swing, a slide and a see-saw in. The only pets we have is a dog and a rabbit. The price of food is very expensive so we buy it in bulk and so get it cheaper. In our house we have got simple but good furnitre. We have electricity central heating all through our house and everything is electric. We have got a phone. It comes in very useful with my Job and also my husbands who is a clark. We have lots of vegetables in our garden as we prefer fresh green food. I am taking up first aid in my spare time.  Words: 167
