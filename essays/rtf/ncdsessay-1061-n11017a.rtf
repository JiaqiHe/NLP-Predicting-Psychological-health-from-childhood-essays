I am now twenty five and I am 'A Little Sister of the Poor'. I enjoy this life very much I have been a nun for four years. The convent is in France. In two years time I will be allowed to go home to visit my parents and my younger brother. I am a teaching nun, I do not teach maths. I only teach English, Needlework, and knitting. The Reverand mother is called Mother [name] my name is Sister [name]. The sisters in the convent are very good and helpful Each morning we are awake for six o'clock. Benediction is a seven o'clock and at seven fourty five we have a pepetual vovene*, followed by breakfast. I take my first morning class at nine thirty I have a cousin in the same order as me she is Sister [name]. She is in a differant dormatry than me. On Thursdays we cook and then nearly every Saturday we have a Sale of Work. It is a marvellous life as a Little Sister of the Poor. We love helping the old. And we even take poor hungry beggers and children in, we give them fresh clothers something to eat and drink and some money. Across the road is a home for begger people and the old. That is also run by the 'Little Sisters of the Poor'.  Words: 226
