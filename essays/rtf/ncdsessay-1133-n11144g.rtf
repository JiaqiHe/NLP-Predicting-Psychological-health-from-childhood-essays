When Im 25 I want to be an acter. I want to go to a drama school and pass all my test I want to get married to a nice man who helps me to do all the house work and takes me to nice places in my spare time like playing tennis taking me to the beach and has a good job. I want to have two children because if you have more its rather espensive and you have them moaning at you all day long. when Im working I hope it doesant wear me out and Im not going to smoke vecause I wont to keep **te and each year I wont to go on holiday and take my children with I hope ones a boy and the other a girl and they get on well to gether instead of fighting with each others and make freinds with the other children. I hope I'll be able to fly on a aeroplane and fly to New york and see the lovely fews and go round in a sports car and learn to drive a car. I hope that I leed a happy live.  Words: 194
