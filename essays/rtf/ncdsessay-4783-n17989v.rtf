At 25 years of age I am happy in nearly everything I do. My interests are sowing, Gardening and my home. The money that I earn is a fair amount, and enough to last the week. Sometimes at the weekend I like playing golf or boating. I don't like staying late in bed. I usually get up from 8-30 to 9 o'clock. I don't often stay in at night I much prefare to go out to clubs a various other places. When I am at work I think if it is worth coming for the bother. The most boring day of the week is a Wednesday The works is a fare distance, and I am glad that I am able to drive. The car is a good thing you can visit in half the time. My life is very pleasant, and I don't wish to be somebody else. I am also lively, and don't like to stay sitting down. I hope that the future is as good as now.  Words: 169
