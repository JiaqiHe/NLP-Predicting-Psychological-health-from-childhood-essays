What I would like to be would to be a footballer for Liverpool playing at left half. I would like to have two children, boys if possible. My ambition is to be on the winning side at Wembley. I also would have the house in the country or in a quiet village.   In the house we would have a 2 bedroom and bathroom upstairs with a kitchen, hall, and lounge downstairs with a playroom for the children.   My partime job would be Fish and Chip shop owner. I would also like to tour the United States of America and go to Butlins for my holiday. with the wife and kids. I would not take the children to the United States of America with me. For my 26th birthday if I didn't all ready have one I would like a car. I would get a red Mini minor.  Words: 147
