My name is [female name] [surname], I am twenty five years old. I have jsut finished my four years Lawyers course, and I am now a fully qualified Lawyer. I'm engaged to be married in one years time. I have many interests such as playing the guitar and sewing and many other interesting things. I have a very happy homelife. I live alone in a small flat. I leave for work at eight-thirty every morning and usually get home about six o'clock in the evenings. I also dont work on Saturdays and Sundays. I have had only one case in court to deal with and I won as the person I helped was proved innocent. My parents are very good to me, I see them about every Saturday and I occasioanlly spend the weekend with them or they come and spend the day up in London with me. We are very close and there are hardly any secrets between us. I'm hoping to have many more cases to do with being a Lawyer, and I hope to be an even more successful. My hobby is to go horse riding espechally in the fields I love any thing to do with horses. I thought that the Lawyers course was most terrible difficult. I nearly stopped half way because I thought that I wanted to be a teacher instead but then I decided that I still wanted to be a lawyer. I have sometime quite a lot of spare time which is always used up and hardly ever wasted because I help a lot at charity bazaart e t c . . . by malling things to be sold for all the charity bazaars and everything else.
