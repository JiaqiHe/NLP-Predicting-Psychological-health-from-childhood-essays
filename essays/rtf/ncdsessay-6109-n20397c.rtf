I am leading a quiet and happy life, and I like still to go and help my sister look after her daughter Julie on Saterdays. I also like to visit my parents and their parents. I work in a dress shop and I like making clothes for other people and also for my self. I earn good wages and I am happy there. I live near my parents and visit them often, my mother cannot do to much work so I help as mych as I can. My husband enjoys sports so we go swimming as much as we can. I often go to visit my bigger brother in London you see he lives away and we do not often see him. For when he comes home he has to travel by train, and he really can not afford to come every month. He usually just comes for the weekend, and he then is not always there he usually goes out every night so we hardly ever see him anyway. I am happy enough I suppose.  Words: 176
