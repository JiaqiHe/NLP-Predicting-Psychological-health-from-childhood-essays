When I am 25 years old I would like a car. I would also like a little house in the Country. When I marry a nice looking man I will have about 2 or 3 children . I will make sure that the house would be tidy and the children would not say bad words. I would try and get a good work and good wages. I would not put a lot of powder , cream, and other things. on my face. If I do marry a man I would like a dog as a pet. If my husband has a lot of money we shall live in a much bigger house . But if I do not marry a will just live in the Country. I would like to become a skating teacher if I can. I think my life will make me happy I hope .  Words: 148
