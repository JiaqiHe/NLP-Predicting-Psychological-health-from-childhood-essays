I think I would get married to a nice man. I would like to live in a big house. I would clean the house look after my mother and father too. On the mornings get up about half past seven for I would have to get the breadfast ready. When I have had my breadfast I would clean the house. If it was Saturday I would go down town for the food, fruit and the things I would need. I would go back home and get the dinner ready. I have got a small job I have to go on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday the job is to clean up at a club. I think I would like it as I want to do a job something like that. We would have a nice big garden with flowers and a lawn but my husband would do that not me. I would go to the club every week about. I do not want to smoke when I get older. I would want my hair to be long. So I would go to the hairdresser's for them to do my hair. I would get some of the flowers and put them in the house inside a vase. I would like to have a telphone. then I could phone my friends and other people I know.  Words: 224
