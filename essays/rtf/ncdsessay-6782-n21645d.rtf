When I'm twenty-five I will have a job of an air hostess, I dont think that I will be married, although maybe I will have some boyfriends. I live in a flat and I ahve a pet black spaniel, named Buttons, and her companion is a Persian cat named tiger. I live by my self, but I am very rarley home with my job, and so I dont get lonely. While I am away my friends helena looks after buttons and tiger.
I go out for alot of meals and have scampi and prawn cocktails. In my spare time I go ice-skating 
I have a companion to enter ice skating competitions with. I of course go to many countrys, and try different kinds of foriegn food. One time when I went to spain I went to see a bullfight, but I left because I could not stand the sight of the blood. After that flight We went to Holland and we saw lots of Dutch milkmaids doing a dance with Yokes over their arms. Then when I went home I had a drink with my friend and went to bed with buttons at the foot of the bed and tiger in my arms.  Words: 202
