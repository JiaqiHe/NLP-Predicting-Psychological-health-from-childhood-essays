If I was 25 years old I would like to be a musishoion in a band and if I had the money I would by a boat to go fishing in a resnable Sised about 14 feet big.. I would go fishing in my own time when I was'nt playing in a band. I would'nt have a car I woudl have moter Skaker I would'nt by a big house but not to Small with a big garden. I would have some pets like fish and rabbits I might go to some clubs like nights club. if I had a chance to pick my band I would pick about five people and I would have a virriaty of instoyments like me playing Saxiophone a claronet anaither with a trumpet another one with a trombone a French horn a cornet and one with a flute. We would play in* Restrants and night clubs I can't think of a name but we would'nt dress up all Silly although we would'nt look all dull. I would have a hobby a home like collecting Stamps or somthimg like that I mite get married and I mite not. If I don't get married I will keep the Small house but if I do I will get a better and bigger house but really I can say what a will do when I am 25 year old  Words: 230
