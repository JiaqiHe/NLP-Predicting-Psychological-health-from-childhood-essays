I am married now and go out to work. Every Monday to Friday I go to some womens house and look after younge children. While their parants go out to work themselves to half past four. Then Saturday morning I do the house-work and washing. The afternoon my husband and I go and get the weeks shopping. Sunday morning I do some more housework, and my husband does the gardening. Sunday afternoon we sometimes go out for a drive if the weather is fine. I would like to have no more than four children of my own. I am very interested in drawing and painting. I like coloured children very much. And I like animals very much.  Words: 117
