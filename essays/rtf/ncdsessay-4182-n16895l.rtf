----------------------
I am now 25 years old and have just finished my five year training to be a vet. I live in a quiet house just on the outscerts of a city where I have many cassualties of dogs, cats, and other quite big animals who have been runover by cars. I am not married so I have no children. I have animals of my own I have a horse, and a dog. When I am 26 I will be travilling to Australia where I will be carrying out my work. I am payed well in my job. When I have the spare time I draw pictures of animals and write about them. I sometimes design children wallpapers with animals.
so that gives me extra money. I often let children see the animals I look after and I take teenagers to teach them about sothey one day may be a vet like me if that is intention. I dont have many hours to work but it is still hard work. I often go to different countries to study different animals and take holidays as well while I am there. I enjoy my work for I have many nice people living around me. My oarents often come to stay with me and help me out sometimes when I have to go on emerjency calls to different houses. I often have to call at farms to attend to sick animals and often find lambs with broken legs.  Words: 243
