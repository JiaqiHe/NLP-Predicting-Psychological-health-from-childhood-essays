I am an actress. At the moment I am in a play a Le**head thearte. Most of the time I am at the theatre. But in my spare time I like going for walks and looking arouns musuems*. I have my own flat that I like to keep very clean and tidy. I like going shopping and looking around big stores. When I profrom in shows I liked to be dressed in long gowns and frily things. I play a part of a rich mohter. If I did get married I would like children. If I have spare time* on a dull afternoon I go to the pictures. I like wachting exiting and thrilling films and sad films bit always end happy. I like going out and see other people acting or singing. I like wearing smart gay clothes.  Words: 139
