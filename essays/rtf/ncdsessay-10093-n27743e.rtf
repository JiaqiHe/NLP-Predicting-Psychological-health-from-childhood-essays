I am 25. I am living in South Africa , and I am head of project (project). An army of this species of ants can travel 50 miles a day, so we must constantly be on the move, or else!!! (name) is the brigadier. He has 50 sergeants in charge of different sectors and each has a platform of 20 men, armed with asbesto* suits to protect them, and DDC sprayers. DDC is a sort of poisonus acid. Sergeant 23, (name), nearly lost his life when escaping from the ants with Lance Corporal (name) when six ants got into his jeep. He escaped with only losing three fingers. The life I am leading is a fairly good one , even though I have no spare time . Command Vehichle one (1), is where I have our headquarter s, (HQ) . We have thirteen , (13) , of these trucks, and they are based in 15 areas. My interests are to get it over quickly as possible, and return to Spain .  Words: 171
