When I am twenty - five years of age I would like to go out to australia to see what it is like. If I liked it I would stay and buy a farm to live in or help in a farm. If I had any spare time I would go down to the beach and there I would stay till as long as I could.
If I did'nt like australia I would come back to Scotland and buy a big house and go to University to train to be a vet. If I had any spare time I would go to a beach nearby if there is one or go for a run in the country and maybe camp a few nights.
On a Sunday I would not work as I would spend the morning in church and the afternoon I would spent going for a run in the car of for having my friends and relations for dinner tea or supper.
On week nights I would like to go to bed early so I was nice and refreshed for the next day.  Words: 181
