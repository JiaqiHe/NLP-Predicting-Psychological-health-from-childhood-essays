I have just turned 25 and I have just become the head cheif at the Grand Hotel the Edgeware London W.1. I have just come from Oxford, and I have been home to Leicester for a few weeks to see my mother and farther and other relations. I get a good wage and I have saved up enough money to go to the moon and have a holiday there or I could go **** to Mars, and I am very divided on this subject. I am not married yet but I have got a girlfriend I still see some of my old school mates from **** and **** and Iam haing a great time. I love swimming and I often go with the boys (They have knocked) the old science buildingdown and they are building a marshan place they have also fond the lockness monster, got to go the lamb is burning.
