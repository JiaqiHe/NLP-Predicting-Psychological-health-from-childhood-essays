I am just approaching the age of twenty six, I have been a primary school teacher for four years and I enjoy it very much . I am getting married in** three months. I live in a little cottage just outside (place), with my parents. I teach an intelligent class. They are primary 52. not too young and not too old. My interests now are different cou*ries all over the world which I plan to visit and learn all about their customs, other interests will be insects like butterflies and bees and caterpillars. As today is a holiday I will be going shopping to buy things like small household goods, My sister and my brothers are all married so I'm the only one left that is not married, But, I hope to be married soon. and settle down. with two children If I had children I would call them (name) and (name) . I would like a boy and a girl . I would not like to have two boys or two girls because I think we should be even, I would like the girl to be older than the boy. because one of my brothers bullied me. but I would not like my girl to bully my boy I am happy so that's all that matters. I would like to live some-where quietly because I like the scenery because it seems peaceful. not like noisy dis tricts . The country is one place where I'd like to live because there are no busy cars .  Words: 256
