I'm 25 years old I work at a paper factory. Sometimes Iwish I never even started this job because after a bit I get very board of thinking of have ing to wait for the bus and getting there lait and then get the sack I ofton dread cooking all my meals as well for the rest of my life and also getting married to a wife who carn't cook carn't hardley talk I know that I'd be the most unhappy man living because I carn't stand women shouting telling me what to do I almost scream at the sight of one and I carn't complain about my work I get good money and I work hard for it too I sapose some day I'll take all that back and get married and then after a few years I'll realise what I've done and get a devorse and that isn't the sort of life I won't to lead then if it's one of the bose's friends I'll get sacked and then I'll ave no job no wife and no happines. any way it's about time I got off to work and I ave to do the cooking and wait for the bus any way I won't cook I'LL ave some cornflaks instead and I'll get the half past eight bus and every thing will be all right. and when I come home tonight I'll ave a cup of tea and a plate of ham sand wiches and then I'LL dream of that tonight and I won't feel unhappy any more any way who needs a wife to be happy I don't and that wife that I dreamed of dosn't ave to come try at all she can ave a cup of tea and a plate of ham sandwiches too then she wont dream of me.
