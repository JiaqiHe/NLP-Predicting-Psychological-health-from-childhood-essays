Now I am twenty five. I am looking for a job. I am looking for a job that will interest me, I am very happy mow. I have got some work as a teacher in [school], and I enjoy it. very much, Just before I became a teacher , I went to collage to do exams, to learn what teaches do, and to help the little children, when they first start school, to help then read and write. Being* a teacher it hard work, you meed a lot of patince and that you do mot mind a bit of noise, I will stay as long as I can teaching because I enjoy Iit very much indeed, most girls want to be murses but I would not like to be a murse, Because I don't like seeing blood which nurses have to, because its there job to see to it, Techers do* hard work but they get payed well, you have to earn money to feed and clothe yourself, and perpos pay for your house. and family, and clothe then and feed them as well and let them go to school to learn things which might be inportent enought to let then take part in it, Teaching is very mice and I am going see if my children would like to be teachers because teaching is the nicest job I think out of all the jobs wowan can do, Because you see how children learn how to read and write, when ther very young and the later on get on harder things, and then when there grownup they might to become teachers, oneday,  Words: 272
