When I am twenty five I will hope to be in the air force piloting a figter plane or a bomber. My favourite fighter is Freedom fighter which is bigger than a spitfire which I hope to be flying and my favourite bomber is the Superfortress which is ninty nine feet long which is said to end* the second world war it carried atomic bombs and had ortomatic guns. I will not have a car because I wont have much time to ride in it I will have a house in the country a little house with a big garden. In the garden I will have a big lawn with a fountain in the middle with a statue of a man holding the earth and trees all around. And I wont get married because I wont be able to see her very much. I will give my stamps to my nephew so he can save them and I will get him stamps when I go over the sea and I will give him pressents from different places and when I get my holidays I will visit as many of my relations as I can. I will give some wooden animals little orniments to [name] my sister because she likes them the best and I will give [name] some pictures of animals because she likes them and I will give [name] some antiqes.
