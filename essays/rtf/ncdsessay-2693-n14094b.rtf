I am a gym teacher, and I teach gym in a primary school in [town]. When I go home at 4 o clock I am usually very tired but I have an hour playing the paino. Sometimes I go out in the evenings to clubs or to dances with my friends. The next day I go back to school to teach little children and big children. Sometimes I give gym club after school for the older wons. When I go home and mum is not there I lay the tea. My Mother is a paino teacher so she teaches me, my father works at the hospital as a docter. On Saturdays I go to ballet and in the after-noon I go riding horses. I am trying to get into the college in Swansea where there are international gym teachers. I am having a test on Monday to see if I can get into it.
