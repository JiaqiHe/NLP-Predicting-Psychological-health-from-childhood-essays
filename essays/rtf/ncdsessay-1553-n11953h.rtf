At the age of twenty five I set out to get some work. I turned out to get a job as a typest in a office. I enjoyed it very much, and became very quick and made no mistakes. Home life was very happy and comforts were splendid. We all took a turn in washing up and tidying the house. And shopping we all got a few odds and ends and sometimes got a lot in. My interests are swimming and stamps. Every saturday I still go to the baths and I can dive in now. I can swim backgrawl, frontgrawl, breaststroke and butterfly and also float. My stamps are increaseing the number and becoming more valuable and more colour in them. But my Polish are still the best of all my stamps. My Great Britain stamps are more than a hundred and still recieving more. And I am also intrested in birds and animals. I love to riding on a horse for they are tame and I would like to feed him and wash it and have riding lessons. i dont hold much resoncibilty for my older sister does alot. But sometimes I do when she is away at a club or dancing lessons on Tuesday. I make the best at work and try to keep the ladies round me happy. And make the best of home in all difficuiltys.
