I would like to live in the country in a small cottage and I would like to own a roadside cafe. I would like a place where I could look out at the beutiful countryside around me and I would like to live by a little streem where birds would bath. I would have a little work shed at the bottom of my garden where I would make things in my spare time my hobies are reading. Art, Making moderl airfix Transport. In the summer I would go down south for my holidays and lay on the beach all day. I would own some stables and lend out horses. and I would ride round the country on a favourite horse which I would call silver. Every so often I would hold partys in a big hall I will have 1/2 a mile from my house. I would by a car which would be a sports car and I would keep it at a garage a bit further up the road. I would put all my money in a bank and take it out only on special ocasions. At night I  would go to a night club of which my freind owned a mile down the road. In my shed I would make chairs and tables then sell off cheap.  Words: 219
