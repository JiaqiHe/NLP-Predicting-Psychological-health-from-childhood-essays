I would like to get married when I was twenty five. This is a wish I had, but I am twenty five and I am not married. When I do get married I would like to have three children two girls and one boy. I am still living with my parents. I am engaged but not married yet. I am the only child left all the rest are married. I go to work at an office, and it is in a big building just been built. I am a secretart doing short hand and typing. I take about twelve letters a day. When I get hom efrom work I stay in one night go to a youth club the next night then stay in for wednesday and Thursday on Friday I go out with my mother. Saturday nights I go to my works night club, but Sunday I stay in all day and go to church sometimes at night. I have got my own front door key. The fashion is still the same as it use to be. I where mini skirts but I have big buckled shoes.  Words: 188
