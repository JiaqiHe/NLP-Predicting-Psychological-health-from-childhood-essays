If I was 25 years old I would play football for a football team, I would be a film star after football. At home I would wash up and cook the dinner. I would most probably emegrate to Australia and live the for the rest of my life I would like to take over the petrol garge my uncle owns. Or be a racing driver, or a reley driver. When I was very old I would like to be a manager for a football team.

I would plant flowers, and get married, in my spare time I would go on holiday. I would go out in the Country and by a car. I could travel about.  Words: 115
