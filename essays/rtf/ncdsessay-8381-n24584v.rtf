I am now twenty five and my favourite hobbies is playing cricket which I enjoy very much I am living in a little house in the country, it has two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a living room. The outside is surrounded by bushy green hedges, in the middle of the Gigantic lawn there is a pond with two artiificial swans round the side. I passed my examination and I went to grammer school. My Job is to check all the files and documents in an office, and it pays very well indeed. I have a car and the make of the car is volvo. The car is white and the inside is all nice shiney wood dashboard. It has a sports steering wheel and leopard seats. I am not married because I didn't want to, and besides wowen are to talkative and they are impossible to control. Really I wish that I was still at school beacuse I used to like it and it used to be great fun. I have a very good tailor who makes my cloths and other peoples clothes perfect. I have heard any body complaining about him yet. My car does nearly 35 miles to the gallon and the speed is 120 miles per hour. My house is exactly 3 miles out of town, so it is very quiet. The only trouble is that I can hear and owl hooting at night. But one night I will catch it.  Words: 244
