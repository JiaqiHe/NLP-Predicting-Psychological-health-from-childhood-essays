My name is Mrs. [surname]. I have three children, two boys and one girl. My oldest is five called [male name], then [male name] he is three and a one year old baby called [female name]. I dont go out to work because of my family. It is quite a hard job looking after three children and trying to get meals prepared. I only go out on Saturday nights with my husband then I have a babysitter. By the time I am thirty I shall have three more children because I like children very much. I like shopping especially for clothes. On Mondays I take my children to town in my mini-car. On Tuesday we go and see my mum. Wednesday I just tidy round. Thursday [male name] and [male name] go to nusery, and the rest of the days is just shopping, making beds, dusting, washing and ironing. [male name] goes to school soon. Sometimes we all go to the pictures or on Sunday we go on picnics in the countryside. Often kids round the neighbourhood take [female name] and [male name] out for the afternoon while Jerry and I go shopping. I like kids very much.  Words: 198
