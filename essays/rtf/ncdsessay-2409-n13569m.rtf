----------------------
I like going swimming ** my spear time I got and going out in the evenings I work in a hairdressers shop as I have always wanted to be a hair dresser since the age of 11.
Starting work at 8 o`clock and finishing at 6, though I get there at seven to get things ready for the first customer.
At weekends I go to the shops and get food as well as going this on a Friday evening I like to go dancing for pleasure.
As well as dancing and swimming I like teaching sewing at a club. If I can I try to watch T.V as it has good programs on. and prohaps go to the libary I have a friend who lives near and we usualy go together.
I am happy the way which my life goes and I hope it stays like that.
I hope if I can travel to switzerland for a holiday in the summer and have a nice time in the alps and on the sky slopes w*tch they have but it is a dificalt desion to make so I will have to say i just remains to be seen.  Words: 192
