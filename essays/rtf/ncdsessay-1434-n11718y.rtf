I am 25 years old, I am married and I also have two children. I live near my mother so I can go to see her every day. Before I had my children I worked at a hospital but I couldn't when I had my children. About a year later I would have another child and then I hoped to have a boy so I would have two boys and a girl I would put my children in a play room while I did my house work then I would take them to the shops to get there dinners After dinner I took them to the park to play. When the children grow up to about ten I would get another job to earn some more money I would be a shop assinant* and the children could look after there selfes* while I was in the shop. They would play with there freinds nicley But I would have to wait another ten years until the children grew up I teach my children to be good and not to sware and to be good to other people. and to use there manners I dont hit them unless they are very naughty and there dad would give them a shilling a week for ther* pocket money until they were eight them they got one and sixpece they put sixpence in there money Boxes and could spend the rest on what they wanted. There dad is kind to them and if they wanted some thing out of a shop he would but it them. My children's names are Candy, paul and steven. my mother would buy them sweets when she came and so would there grand-dad when he came.  Words: 286
