My name is (name) I am 25 years old. I am leading a good life and I am enjoying it. My intrests are , Horse Riding, Swimming, Ballroom Dancing, and Reading . I have a very good job as I am an air Hostess and I have sen many different places . The places I liked the best were Spain where all the dresses were colourful and of course the bullfight was good too, Italy, France, america, australia, and Canada. I enjoy being an air Hostess because you meet a lot of people and you get a lot more freinds The good thing about being an air Hostess is you are not kept in the one place all the time but you get around and you also learn diffrent languages which can be helpful sometimes. I am always glad when I can get home for week-ends and a weeks holiday as I miss my parrents very much and I also miss my pets. When i get home for holidays I always bring presents for my parents from everywhere I've been . I am always glad to get home and get a rest after being up in the air all day and as soon as I give my parents their presents and get something to eat I go straight up to bed to get a sleep as I am very tierd. When my holidays are over I am in a way glad as I sometimes get bored when I have nothing to do so I am always glad to get back to work and back to my very best friends and my passengers. I think I am very lucky to have such a good job and to see all the countries round the world and get to know them and their languages and how they live I think it is most interesting .  Words: 312
