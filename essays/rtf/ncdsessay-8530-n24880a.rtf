I am 25. I am at collage studing maths and English. When I leave collage I am hoping to teach maths and english to Seniors, in a big School. Then after a few years I would like to work were my mam is (or was). My mam works for [company]. She is a tracer. At collage I have lots of friends, both girls and boys. I like animals. I like dogs best. Ever since I was ten I have always thought that cats steal. I like reading and drawing. I am not a good drawer but I still like it. I am not going to smoke and all I am going to drink is export. My mam has always drank it. I like to read books on people who go into a far off country and have an adventure. I like horses one day I am hoping to have a horse and ride over the country. I am NOT going to get married.  Words: 163
