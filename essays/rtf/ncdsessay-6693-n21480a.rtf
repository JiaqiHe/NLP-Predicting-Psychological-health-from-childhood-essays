One day I was in Holywood acting in a film called Fly Far Away at the end of the reherseal i was going home in my car when i saw my friends pilaying football. I went to have a game I was very good. That gave me an idea and that year I went to Join the rover a famous football team I had to pass a certain test and I did. On the day of my first match we played a team called Madrid I played in goals. In the first half I let in one goal at half time the score was 2-1 in the minute the ref gave Madrid a penalty i had to save it it down came their shattering centre half Pele to take it with a great shot the ball hit me in the face i fell on the floor unconsious over the ball. that year i was chosen for the England team I played and served the Country at forty six i gave up football.
