I do not go out to work as I have a little baby girl. Her name is [name] she is only 3 weeks old. I like doing house-work and enjoy looking after [name]. I get nice clean jobs, some are a little messey but I can not say I do not like them. Because it a pleasure doing things for my own child. It is nice to dress them in their pretty clothes. 
But I still have to do the housework. It does not mean that I can retier, because I have a baby girl. There is alot of washing ironing and so forth. There is A lot more clothes what with the nappies bibs, ext. It takes alot of time up. And when you start to bake something goes wrong either [name] starts crying or someone comes to see you. 
I go swimming every Tuesday night. My husband looks after [name]. I get all the milk ready before I go. 
[name] is bottle fed so it is easy for me to go out. I was a Girl Guide Captain, But I left as it was to much for me. I like baking best, but in summer when it is hot I get very warm. it is with going in and out of the oven. We all go out on a saturday to my mothers house for tea.
After I have done the house-work I take [name] a walk. She likes that we have alot of pets and she likes to touch them, and feel the fir.  Words: 256
