I am married and have two children boy and girl 1 3 years old and 1 1 year old. On Saturdays I play for a football team. I am working in an office at [city] and I drive a car I like to do some gardening and mending things which are wrong with my car.
      My family and myself like to go out as much as we can especially on Sunday afternoons. We have a three bedroomed house with 1 lounge and 1 dining room 1 large kitchen 1 bathroom 1 outside toilet.
      I have just finished converting the pantry into another part of the kitchen We have a very large garden with a path leading to the garage. The front garden is divided into 3 parts with Cotswold Stone seperating them.  Words: 132
