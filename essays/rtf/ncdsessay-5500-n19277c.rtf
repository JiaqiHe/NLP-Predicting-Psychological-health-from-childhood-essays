----------------------
I am An Architect . I am just married and living in a house in the country. A small village is near where I go once a week for food and anything else that I need. I have a landrover. I go out nearly every weekend into the country. I don't go to any pubs or clubs as I don't smoke or drink. I keep a few animals as pets that I have found injured or abandoned. I have a large garden with many trees, bushes and flowers. I get on very well at work and getting a good salary. I have already designed a few hourses. I come home at dinner time. I leave about 8 in the morning . I have been an Architect for about a year. I have had the house for about 2 years and I hope I don't have to move as it is such a nice place. The office I am working in is on the out - skirts of a town. The building is quite big and my office is just a handy size to store all the books drawings and all the other things I need to have . The road leading from the house is very bumpy. Usually in my spare time I take the dog for a walk in the country .  Words: 223
