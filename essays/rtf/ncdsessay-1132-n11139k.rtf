I go to work seven o,clock in the morning. I start to work right away making parts of cars. Work through doing this right through the evening till four o,clock aftr work I go to museums to see famous things. When I reach home I have my dinner do some of the house work on my own, when I have finished I sit down and watch television for a few minutes and the starting to make things from wood. On weekends I go to the beach have a nice swim and then I shall go to the Odeons ar cinema's. On sundays I go to church then go to my friends house and go places with him and then when I have holidays I go on journeys finding out about the middle ages.  Words: 133
