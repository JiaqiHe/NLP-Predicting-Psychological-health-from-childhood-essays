If I was twenty five years old I hope I could own a riding stable with lots of horses, it would be in the new forest. I would have a nice stable in the middle of the forest and I would have several helpers. In the stable I would an indoor padock so when when it rained the grass would not get when. In the paddock like other ones there would be jumps in red and white paint. My interestsare probaly swimming and I also would like to be a swimming coach and have a swimming pool of my own. In the new forest next to my stable I would have a big house with a swimming pool in the garden. In the stable I would have four New forest ponies, two Dale ponies and six irish ponies. I could choose a team of riders which could enter fot the Prince Philip cup. As well as riding my other inersts might be stamp collecting and cycling. By them I hope my stamp collection will have grew and I might have some valuable stamps. For my holidays I would try to save up enough money to go abroad to Europe or Australia. In my house I would buy a dishwasher so I would not have to do it myself. At the local Gymkanas I could pick a team for team events and if they win I would put all the cups the people had won in a special room  Words: 248
