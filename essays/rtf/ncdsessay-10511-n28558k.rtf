I have a job as a assitant in a shop. Five days a week I go there and enjoy it very much. It is a material shop. Things I like to do are reading, looking at clothes, walking and my job. I live in a flat just off a main road. I am leading a happy but busy live. The cooking I do myself and enjoy making cakes. One of my friends share the flat with me. On saturdays I walk on the moors. I do not have a car but I go by bus. The moors are not far away. I have a friend in Leciseter who I like very much. We have known each other since we were babies. On a Saturday afternoon we meet each other if possible. We meet at different places. My friends name is [female name]. I left school at the age of eighteen. I lived with my parent until I was twenty three. I get my reading books from the libaray. On a Monday I go there. The flat has got 4 rooms which are kitchen, dining room, hall and a bedroom which me and my friend share. My friend is also twenty five. She has a job in a hairdressers. On Sundays I usually stay at home. If it is raining I go swimming. I can dive and swim twenty lenghs. The swimming bath is big. If it is sunny I go outside and sit in a chair and read.  Words: 248
