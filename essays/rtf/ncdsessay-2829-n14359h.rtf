I am living in a cottage in the country behind the cottage is a river, my job is to keep the river tidy. I have two miles to look after, one day I was walking allong the river as usual when I saw a big swirl about 20 yards ahead so I started running, when I got there I could not see anything so I waited for about five minutes then I saw a little fish of about 8 ounces being followed by a large pike. He weighed about 40 pounds, so I followed him.
After a while they stopped so I quikly went home and got a big net to try and catch the pike, I also put on my swiming trunks so that I would not get my clothes wet, when I got back I wadded out into the water and then I tried to get him but I missed him and he was off he went as fast as he could, then I took another swipe and this time I got him and he draged me to My cottage I was very lukey because he tired out about 20 yds before my house so I was able to bring him in.
