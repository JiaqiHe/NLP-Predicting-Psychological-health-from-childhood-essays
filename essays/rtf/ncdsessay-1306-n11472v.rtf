"It was one of my usual days at York College. I was trying to be a master of Maths And in my spare time I play football then do some more homework. My master was a very stricted but helpful man. I spend most of my time at College learning different kind of sums. I live with my mother and father at home. My brother is now 16 years old and is just leaving Lowfields. My two sisters are both married. My brother and I are the only ones at home. My mother and father are pensioners and live of thier pension money. When I get a job I am leaving home and buy my own house but I will visit them often. I will soon be a master of Maths if I am lucky because we are going to take my test with 9 others. My brother didn't pass his 11 plus and I didn't the first time but I did in the 13 plus. I didn't now what to do when I finished at [school] so I went to College at York. My master said ""I try hard and I should pass to be a master Maths. The other 9 boys will pass very early. If I am a master of Maths I will next try to be a Master of English and so on. My great aim in life is to lead a happy life and get a good job. I do not what I want to be but my father may give advice on which job would suit me best in life for me."  Words: 268
