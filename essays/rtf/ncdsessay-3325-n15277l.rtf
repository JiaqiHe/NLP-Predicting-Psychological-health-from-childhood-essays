When I am 25 I will get a better job like a short hand typist. I would like to travel around the world a lot, I will try and get married when I am about 25 year of age and until I get married I will do as many things I **n then I will settle down with a day job and work at home most of the time. If I get married I will go on a honeymoon to Spain or France. I will leave school at 16 years of age then get a job when I am about 18 and keep the job a long time until I get married My best hobbie at school is Art I like it very much and I would like to do it when I grow up I like it at school and m ost of the time I do Art.
