I get up every morning at about 6am to start to get ready for my job as a Motoring school instructor I injoy this very much for I have been interested in cars all my life. In my job I meet a lot of people and you have to get youst to people very quickly. I start work at 8am every morning exsept Saturdays and Sundays Th first thing I have to do every morning before I do enything else is I have to find out who I have find out who I have got to go and collect for a leason. I leave of at 6pm and by the time I get back I am getting very tierd. I have a wife and two children one boy and one girl the boy is 6 and the girl is 3. My boy is at school and is doing very well. The type of car that I own is a Austin 3 litre and I notice a lot of difference between that and the sinca 1100s* that we have down at the school. One of my main hobbys are wood work so I can make cubords and book casses and things like that for the house and so it comes a lot cheaper than buying things.  Words: 215
