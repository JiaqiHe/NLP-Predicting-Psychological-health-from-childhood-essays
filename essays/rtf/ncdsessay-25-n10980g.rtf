I go to work. Come home at 5 o'clock and look after my pony. I would like to find all the habits of ponys things they like and dislike If they like being brock in. Or being taught tricks and things I would like to be a vet or something to do with animals. I would like geto university but I don't think I'll ever get there. I'd like to have four children to sets of twins if I am lucky. I would love to live in the country and have a pony stud And have all my family with me. In my spare time look after children or paint (not good at it) The one thing I would love to do is to get a gold medal for horse jumping at Olypic Games. I am not fosey on Sport so I don't think I'll do anythink that line. I would like to speke several laigers. I would like my house with old fashien furniture. And have a fetch roof on my house. It would have to be a cottage at least a hundred years old. My home life I hope will be a happy, one I want a very happy life and live to age of 94 years old. At the age of twenty five you will mostly be wearing trousers and shirt. With long brown straight hair like I have now  Words: 233
