I would buy a house get chairs tables and all the things I needed for my house. I would get a job of a carpinter to make wooden things for people. I would not drink or smoke and at home I would buy books to read. I would go to places to see what they are like and exploring things. I would not get maried. I would stay like a ordenery man. I would see my friends and talk to them about my job and were I have been. Every Saturday I would go out to the shop to buy food to eat and when I am working I would not stop to have a meal until its time to have my dinner. I would make cuberds and chairs for people who what cuberds and chairs. I would get my tools for the job. I would lean how play drums so when I want to do some thing I would play my drums. I would get a televion and I would wtach programes that are very interesting to wtach. If I could get a motor scoter I would go to see my mother and go to work on it and I would never go on strik. I would go on with my work I would not stay in the house all the time I would go out and visit my friends if my friends was it truble. I would help him if I could but I would not get into truble my self. If I could help it and if there was a better job I would get it.
