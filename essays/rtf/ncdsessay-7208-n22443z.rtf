I am a secretary my boss is the owner of a sweet factory. The office is on [street name] Street it is at the top of a tall building. I sort out all mr Hills acounts and bills. (That's my bosses name) I am married and have one child two years old, she is queit content at her grandma's all day. I start work at half past nine, dinner break is from twelve thirty until one thirty in lunch hour I usually have a snack at the cafe across the road. A few sandwiches a cup of coffee and a bun will do me, sometimes I have an apple afterwards. At one thirty I get in the lift and press the button that sayes ten, when at the top of the building I sit down in my comfy back leather chair, and I look down on [street name] Street.
