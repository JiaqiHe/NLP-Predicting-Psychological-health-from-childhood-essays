My work is an author I started off with Childrens book which were very good so I thought I would go on to adults story books. I wrote one about The Mystery cave. The Ship reck, and other Stories like those two. I like being an author because I like writting Stories of all kinds. I like writting imaginary stories becasue usally you can write about what you like. I like writing Adventure stories best because I think they are more exitting than other stories because of them being adventurious.
