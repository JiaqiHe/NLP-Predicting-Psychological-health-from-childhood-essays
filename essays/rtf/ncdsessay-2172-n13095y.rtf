I am a pilot and I am single and I live with my parents. I am based near my home and I am Well payed. I stayed at school and until I was eighteen and I took courses in navigation, astronomy, science and chemestry. I am not engaged and I am often away from home a long time. The plane I fly is a vertical take over, supersonic, single seater fighter jet. The jet is armed with the latest homing missiles and has six guns, three on each wing. For a pass time I make models and I go away for a week every year. I am trained in unarmed combat and I am also atrained marksman. I like reading books and watching T.V. when I can. The money I save I put into the bank but I always keep some spare money to buy books and models. I also borrow books from librarys to read. I am also heavily insured against anything that might harm or kill me but so far I have never fired at a true enemy plane but I have guarded visiting statesmen's plane on their way in or out.
