Today I am going to the (Cin) Cinema with my little boy. I like going to the cinema once a week. That is one of the things I  like best, but most of all I like cooking, reading and sewing. I go to college twice a week because I want to be a part time nurse. I am a bit worried not because I havent *** I live in a bungalow. I don't do much work because when I am at college my ** mother comes and minds the baby she (tides) tidies the house up and makes the babies dinner and ten and puts him to bed. So all I do is make my husbands tea when he comes home from work. On tuesday I take my little boy to the clinic for his injections. I only see my husband six times a week because he works all over the world. Last september he went to Spain and I went with him. This year we are going to Italy and France.  Words: 172
