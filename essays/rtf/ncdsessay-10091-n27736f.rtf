When Iam 25 I hope to be a Tecnition in the Army. I would have one mane interest to become a first class tecnition and travile round the world. I would not get married till I leave the armey, because in 1 year you would onley see your family about 15 times my work would be to fix tanks or planes. I would be leading a life of adventure, my home would be in an army camp. my life in the army would be a hard one but I will probally get used to it. when I leave the Army, I would buy a house in the country. if I got marrid I would want one child, a boy so that he can go in the armey as well. I would make sure he got a good education. So if he went in to the armey he could have a life of adventure.  Words: 153
