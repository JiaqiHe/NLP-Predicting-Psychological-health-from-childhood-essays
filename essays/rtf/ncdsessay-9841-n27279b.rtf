----------------------
I live in a semi detached house and I work as a part time school teacher at a primary school. At weekends I take time of and go to the tennis club to which I belong. I am also a guide captain and this takes up some of spare time.
      I have a husband who works in a bank. I also have two children [name] who is 5 and goes to school and [name] who is 3 and goes to nursery school. 
      In the mornings I have to get up early so as to see my husband off and also get ready myself. [name] has to catch the school bus at 3.45 so she has to be ready by then. I have to drop [name] off on my way to school as he is to little to go by himself. I only work in the mornings so I do my housework and shopping in the afternoon. I usually only have a snack for lunch but I have a proper meal in the evening when my husband comes home. My husband and I belong to the local film society and we often go to the cinema in the evening. I also like gardening and our garden looks very nice in summer. 
      Every year my family and I go on a holiday in the summer. We usually go to Devon.  Words: 230
