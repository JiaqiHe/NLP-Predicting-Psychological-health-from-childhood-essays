"When I am twenty five
I wake up in the morning and I stoped the clock and I got up out of bed and look out side and the weather is misty so I go into the bathroom and clean my teeth and then I wash my face. I have boiled eggs and a cup of tea for brekfast*. After I get my clothes on I get out my sports car and go to where I work. My job is an electrician the job I have to do is to get a television fixed so I go in a red minie to [house number] [surname], I knock on the door and about five minuites later a lady comes about twenty two and says are you the electrician so I siad ""yes"" and I have come to do your television so she said come in so I went in and the house was filled with gold orniements and the wall had orange and white wall paper, so she took me into a nother room and showed me the television. The coulor of the television was gray round the sides and when it was not on the front inside was greeney gray. I thought to myself for the first time I can fix a television mysels and I thought very happy, so the first thing I took of was the back of the television and I pulled a valve out 
About six minutes later I put the cou*r of the television back on and I told the lady it was five shilings so she gave me a shiling four sixpances and a two shiling bit so I went out. When I got home I dried and washed my dishes then I went to the cinima and watched a film called the six scouts so it was all about a nice world so when I went home I got my clothes off and had a drink and made an electrical moter and went to bed."
