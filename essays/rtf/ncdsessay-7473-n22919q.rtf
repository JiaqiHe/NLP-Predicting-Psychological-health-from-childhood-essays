"I am now 25 years old. I have just finished a two year training course to be a nurse . I have put my name down to be a midwife because my mother always told me I am very good with children .
I am now earning xxxx9 ""1* ""Od every week Sometimes I get invited to party's by my friends On Saterdays (name) asks me to come round to listen to her records.
A nurse's work you might think is very hard, but sometimes it isn't. some parts are quite easy like bathing babbies . The hospital have now recieved ten baby racks to stop babbies slipping about in the bath. What I like best is making breackfast, dinner or tea for the pataents . In holidays I help in the eurseries, it is not for children its for plants. At home I have a greenhouse full of plants. (**) I have p***mulas, cactuses, creepers and all sorts of plants. I always go to the beach on saturdays with my sister (name) for a swim. When I go home to see my mother"  Words: 182
