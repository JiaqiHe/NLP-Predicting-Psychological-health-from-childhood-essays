I am 25 and I live in a flat with my brother. (we save money that way). I am interested in Dogs, Biology, Geology, arceology, and slightly interested in Stamps. I teach Biology, Geography and English at a school nearby. I have a feeling that my pupils have a special, uncomplimentary name for me. Dot Hat is rather shabby, but I try to brighten it up with my sewing which I don't think is very good. (name) (my brother), and I, are pooling our extra money together, so that when we get time off work at the same time, we can visit our parents in the country. (name) works at a computor and has to be up and off to work at quite an early hour. Sometimes he has to get up even earlier, so then there is a lot of noise, and you can hear his muttering to himself as he looks for something. There is even more muttering when he finds he's been sitting on it! Our cousin sometimes comes to stay with us then we make a lot of noise and the landlady yells and thumps on the wall. My class at school is very crowded and always unattentive. More than once I have been forcefully presented with an ink pellet, behind the ear.  Words: 217
