"at the age of 25 I am a professional footballer and I have just been signed on by an English club who are struggling to keep in the 3rd division , they have a very small stadium but a new stand is being built to give the ground a larger capacity . I live all by myself in a small semi - detached bungalow . When I am not playing football I work in an office where I get xxxx9 10s a week which is a good packet considering the mornings and afternoons I get off to go to training . The team I signed on for is (team) and I live on the outskirts of (place) which is a long way away from our home pitch . Sometimes when I am travelling down in the car I wish that I was playing for (team) because I would save money on petrol which has went up threepence a gallon . at home I have to look after my tropical fish , goldfish , rabbits , cat, dog and my pet budgerigors . You may think this is a lot of pets to keep but they are the only things to keep me company. in winter . They are all well trained and they do not attack one another . In summer I go on hikes and camp with my friends, (name) the spaniel always comes with us but of course the others cannot . When I am away I get (name) to look after my pets and tell her to feed them well on the food I supply . When I am just at home on an ordinary day I make my own meals but on on special occasions (name) helps me . When I bought my pets the cat was the cheapest , costing only 7/6 . 
It is called (name) as it is pure white . The two goldfish named , (name) and (name) were the first pets I bought and that was only about a year ago . The rabbits are named (name) and (name) and both are pure white .
The tropical fish cost well over xxxx 13 altogether counting the aquarium and the other odds and ends . I have thought about selling my mini , but I coudn't because I was so used to it . When the football season restarts I shall be playing as well as I can and I hope to get a good appreciation from the ""fans."""  Words: 416
