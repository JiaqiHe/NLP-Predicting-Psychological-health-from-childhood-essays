I imagine I would get married and have two children. I would live in my home village, [village]. I would have a plain ordinary car a four seater I would live a life full of happiness. My work would be as a naturalist and travell all over the world studying rare animals. My greatist ambition is to go to the African Bush and start an animal Clinic to look after lame animals. I would like to see a lion-tiger cub or any cross born cub. I would also like to do a very unlikly thing that is to talk to the animals. I would have lots of pets right from a mouse to an elephant. I would wear modern clothes. My house would be a little one only two bedrooms a kitchen and one lounge also a hall. I would be head of the house. After a few years I would own a farm of about twenty Arces divided into ten feild. I would go to the cinema often I would go to a night college and study animals.  Words: 179
