I work in an office down town, my job is an apprentis to be a enginear. My wife and I live in a flat in the [location] estate, I wanted to be a enginear and my wife wanted me to be an enginear so their were no arguements about jobs. The six children are happy in the flat and so are we. In my spare time I'm a trainer for a football team. The training days are all Wednesday and Saturday morning. On the job I have three days off a week which are Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. I'll get payed well next week when I become a qualified enginear, the pay will be from xxxx25 to xxxx30 a week which is goof money. On Sundays I take the wife and the children to the moors in the car. I had the Consel when I first started driving at twenty years of age. I have it taxes and tested till March. The car doesn't make me any trouble. My dreams are to become a famous enginear and at least own a petrol station. So I like my life at 25  Words: 190
