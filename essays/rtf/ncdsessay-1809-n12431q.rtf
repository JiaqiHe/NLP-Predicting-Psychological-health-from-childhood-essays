When I am twenty five I will hope to be a short typist. I am leading a very interesting live I am married and I have no children.
      When I am home I spend my spare time doing needlework and I am a member still of the guiding Assocation. In a weeks time I am going to my brothers and sister's 21 birthday they are not married yet. I also have a pet rabbit still which is grey but he is very old but he's as licky a ever. I still like cycling, and swimming.  Words: 95
