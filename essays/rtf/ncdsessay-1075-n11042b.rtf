If I was 25 I'm now leading a good life I have a wife and children. My intrests are football, cricket and Athletics but most of I like to play football because When I was at school I won a certificate for football and I only played one game for the cricket team against [town]. We had a nice big home and at the end of the big garden ran a small stream which had fish in it I would work as a builder or something like that we'd have a car or a van to ride about the country side And if possible be a professanal footballer and the team I'd like to play for is Leeds United the team I've always supported but I dont know about cricket which I'm not very good at and I dont know about Athletics which I'm very good at. When I 'm at home be able to put my feet up and relaxe and an sundays I'll lie in bed.  Words: 168
