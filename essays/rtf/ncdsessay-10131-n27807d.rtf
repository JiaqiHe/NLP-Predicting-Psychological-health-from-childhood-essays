When I am 25 I hope to be playing top grade football for Manchester United and England. I would like to own a buisness to get my mind off football sometimes I would like to own a boutique, I hope I will be married with a couple of children 2 boys. I would live in a bungalow just outside Manchester and own a house in the country just for holidays. If I had a car I think it would be a mini cooper. When I am not playing football I would like to play some other sport like cricket or tennis. When I am a footballer I would like to be earning up to 100 pounds a week plus bonuses for winning compertitions and cups for the club. I would like to win every medal that I could and I hope to be capped for England. In the close season I would like to go for a holiday in Majorcia or Spain with my wife and family.  I would* like to write books in my spare time about my life in football and what has happened to me when I was small and how I have become a footballer, I would write a set of books about 5. I would like to coach young children and teach them how to improve their skills in football. At my house I would have 3 bedrooms, a sitting room, dinning room, a kitchen and a pantry*. It would be heated by coal fires. The front windows might be french and the rest audinary I would have a front and back gardan. In my spare time I would like to go to one or two parties with my friends.  Words: 285
