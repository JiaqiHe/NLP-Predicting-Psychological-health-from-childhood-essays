My own work is now at [airfield] as a pilot, soon I shall be coming home on leave. I have been in the R.A.F. for 5 years now, although I have a few friends life can get boring even if you are in the daily mail air race London to New York in a Harrier Jumpjet. The Phantom still holds record of 4 hours 8 1/2 minuts.
Since I have been in the R.A.F. most of the time, I don't have much time at home even then I have to do even more work with my wife [female name] in Northampton, Luckily I live near the football ground Ican sneak away from doing the housework and watch a fooball match.  Words: 119
