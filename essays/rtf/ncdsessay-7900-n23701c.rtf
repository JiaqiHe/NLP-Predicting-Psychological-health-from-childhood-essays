I work at a vets shop in [suburb} I do this because I like working with animals. I live in a house on [town] housing estate near Newcastle. I am not married yet but I might. My coin collection from 203 when I was 11 to 394 now it is getting quite big. I am saving up for a car either an Escort or a Austin 1300 for next year. In a few years time I think I will emmigrate to Austrailia or Canada because they have better jobs there I have an Alsation dog called Rufus. He is a good watchdog.  Words: 102
