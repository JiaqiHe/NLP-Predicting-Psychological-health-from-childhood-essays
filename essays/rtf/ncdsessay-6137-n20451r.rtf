I'm 25 years old and I work in a shop a chemist I like working there, at night I go out sometimes. At home I watch televison and do all odd jobs jobs around the house, I like the life I am leading and soon I will be getting married. I have Tuesdays off so I can go and do my shopping or stay at home and tidy it up. At home I mostly watch televison or do knitting, or a go to cinema with my boyfriend. On Sundays my boyfriend and I go for a walk if it is not raining. I enjoy my work very much because you get to know other people and they get to know you.  Words: 121
