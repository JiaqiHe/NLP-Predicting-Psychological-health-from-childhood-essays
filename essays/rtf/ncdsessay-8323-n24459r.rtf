I am twenty five years old now. I have just finished collage. I have been training to be a farmer. Ever since I have been a little boy I have wanted to be a farmer now I have got what I wanted. My father has treated me with a farm, which I am going to rent of him. My father was very pleased when he knew that I was going to carry on with some of his land. This farm which my father has treated me to has got one hundred and thirty three acres in which he hopes I am going to farm as well as what he has farmed for thirty one and a half years. The farm also has thirty nine * pig stys which are all full of pigs It has four coushed which are full of cows. It was certainly a real nice g***. This is all my father said. He said I would much rather give you the land than sell it too some body else who know who isnt going to too look after it. He then said, I only hope you look after it. The end.  Words: 194
