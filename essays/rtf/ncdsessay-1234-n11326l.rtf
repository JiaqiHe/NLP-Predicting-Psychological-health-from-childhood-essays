"I had just started my third year as a domestic science Teacher. I had trained for three years at a college I am married and have got a little boy. My mother looks after him while I am teaching. I live in a bungalow just out side ****. I enjoy going for a walk in the country, and knitting etc, reading I like very much and I like to make things gay. At home I like gardening and I like to keep the bungalow tidy. One of my favourite interests are a keeping pets, we have a dog, birds and a hamster. The work I do is very enjoyable when pupils come and learn how to sew, knit etc I always ask them if they would like to be a domestic science teacher and some-times they say, ""yes"" others say, ""no because I don't  like sewing etc."" And some don't know. I like teaching them very much and I hope some will be Domestic Science Teachers. At my home we are all very happy and when we have visitors we all try and make them very well-come. I like parties and things. When I first left school I had surficient a levels to be a Domestic science Teacher so I then began to train."  Words: 214
