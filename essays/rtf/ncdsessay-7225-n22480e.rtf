First I would get a job, I would try and get one in a pet shop. After I had been there some time I would leave work for a little while to have a baby. I would hope to have about three. I would leave them with my mother if she was willing to look after them while I went to work again. When they were two or three I would start to give them pocket money which would increse as they got older. I would let them have a pet each, whatever ones they wanted. Sometimes at mornings when they were about six I would leave them on there own while I went down the shops etc, but I would turn all the fires off. I would teach them to swim when they were two or three, but I would take only one in the water at a time. I would let them go places on there own, and I would give them a little responsbilty so that they would grow confedent of themselves. I wouldent fuss over them to much, but I expect I would a little. I would not spoil them very much only a little. Sometimes I would take them to circuses and fun fairs. I would probely be interested in swimming and games as I am now. I would let my children bring friends home to play and for tea.  Words: 235
