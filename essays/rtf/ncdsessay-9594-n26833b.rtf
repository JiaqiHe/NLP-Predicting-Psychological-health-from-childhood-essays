If I was 25 years old I would like to be a footballer and play other football teams in other countries and see what it is like. I would like  a new house and a car. If I had to do another job I would like to be a shop keeper and when I went on my holidays I would like to go to sunny places. I would want to live in a nice place and when Im on my holiday I would like to go on a ship round England. If I was a footballer I would like to play on saturdays and on saturday nights I would like to go rides in my car and if the team who I played for didn't have a match I would go and watch a team near play. When I was on my holidays I would like to stay in a hotel and on the morning go a walk on the beach before my breakfast. Then after my breakfast go to to shops then have my dinner and go a ride round the place were I was staying and I would stay for 2 weeks  Words: 194
