When I am 25 I will try to find a job as a contomanater (comptoneter opeator?). I hope to be maried because I love babies. On Sunday should like to go to horse riding for I love horse too.   I will have four pets a rabbit named Hoppity a dog named Russ a cat named Micky and bird named Joey.  I would have a house in the country so I would fined a lot about the wild life. I would like to live in the country for it more peaceful than the town. But I will visit my mother oftenly.  I will also visit my old teachers.  Words: 107
