I am a soldier in the army. It is a very good job and exitting you do all sorts of things like sport, trianing how to use a gun in battle, and how to drop from a plane, and you do jimnastics in a great big hall. Some of the sports are cricket, football, rounders, netball and basket ball. 
      In the army you find lots of friends and you can go out to places when you have your day off. We go to lots of exitting places abroad. Some of my most adventurous places are to Australia where there was fighting going and there you had a chance to use some of the things you learnt to use. You learn how to fly jets and you aim at targets and all sorts of other things. If you want to you could go into different groups and do different things. There are about nine to ten, you can learn to drive a tank and other kinds of transport for certain things if neccersery. If you want to learn how to handle big boats you have to swim over half mile and do other things. When you do pe there are lots of differant things to go on, you alsar can do acts to go on show. infront of other people.
      In the army there are lots of different stages if you work hard you will go up a stage until you come to a place where you want to leave.  Words: 250
