If you were 25 years old you could go out and dig the garden and you can grow seeds like flower plants. If I was 25 years of age I would get married and have a job in a shop or I would be a hair dresser but I would rather work in a shop because you would get a lot of money and it is because I like shops because you can get food from them, and that is where we get our clothes from. If I lived some where I would like to live in a place very, very far away from here which is [town]. Because my Aunty lives there and there is nice gardens. And there is bungalows with very big gardens in them is flowers, cabbage's, kidney beans and potatoes and I would like to live next door to my aunty [name]. you can walk to the beach in [town] but there is pebbles on it and it do hurt your feet and you can get shells from there. I will tell you about it when I went there before. well when I went to [town] before my aunty [name] had a dog named sally and me and [name] went and took sally for a walk over to the beach and we had to cross a bridge and it was awful long and it was awful quiet. But when we came back sally my auntie's dog stung his leg on a stingy nettle and he kept barking so I had to run over and tell my aunty that sally had stung her leg and she rushed over to have a look at him and he did not stop barking because it hurt him and my Aunty [name] did not know what to do but I did not know what she did to him but about a year after he died* and I do not know how he died but it was a shame because sally was a nice dog.
