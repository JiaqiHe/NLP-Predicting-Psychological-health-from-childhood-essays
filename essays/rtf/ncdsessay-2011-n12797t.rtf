I am getting on very well as a full time proffesional footballer Playing for England a lot and getting more famous every day. My club West Ham are pretty well near the top. Of the first division, I am top goalscorer of all the divisions. I am leading a good and healthy life. We have training every day where we run, do exersises, have a practice game, and lots of other exersises to get you fit. I have Sunday of and some afternoons of. When I played for England last I scored 2 goals, and I think that was the best game I have ever had for England. West Ham are in the Sixth round of the F.A. cup, I think we are going to get to wembly But one thing I am not sure about is that we will might win it, because there are a lot of good teams: I am married and have two children. and I have a jaguar car, which cost me xxxx700. I earn 100 pounds a week I save some give some to my wife and spend a little bit on myself. I have very few friends because every one wants to be a friend of a famous person. I stay in a lot, for if you go out every one wants your autograhp. If I go on holiday I always go abroard because no one no you in any other country, and any way it is a better. abroard. I live in the country in a little version of a mansion, it is not very small but it is not very big. The only pets I have are 2 alsations 2 kittens and 1 rabbit. My house is quite near a town to get shopping and things like that.  Words: 297
