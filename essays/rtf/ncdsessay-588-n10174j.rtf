I am now twenty five years old. And I am now living in* England in a place called [place name] I live in a nice big house where it is very quiet because where it is very quiet because when I went to Ireland when I was young I went on a farm and I didn't get headaches like I do when their a lot of traffic about. And where we live it is not busy and this is a good thing for our child I have got a job as a doctor and there is a lot of money involved in this job and if we keep saving some money every week we will soon have enough money for a car some new furniture and the house being decorated. When my wife goes shopping shen does not take our baby boy with her she leaves him with the old woman next door she does not mind because her daughter does her shopping for her. My wife sometimes goes to bingo with her freind and I go down to the club with my neighbout. When my wife and I go out we go to the pictures or up to the park with our child.  Words: 204
