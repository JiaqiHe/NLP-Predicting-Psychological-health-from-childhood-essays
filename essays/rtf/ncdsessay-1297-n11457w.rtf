"I am 25, my job is proffesional football and I play for Tottenham Hotspur F.C. I live in London (near tottenhams ground) In my spare time I play golf or tennis and sometimes rugby. I share my slat with and old school mate who also plays for Tottenham F.C. My life is very interesting and I am looking for a wife. If I have any spare time when I get cored my freind and I go cancing but we are not very good and often fall in! I like to read the papers and still like comics. I occaisanly go hird watching. I own a stray dogs home which is kept running by my football wages I called one of the dogs ""Jimmy"" after the great Jimmy Greaves. I am training the dogs to play ""nose ball"" (which I made up) they use a balloon for a ball and try to score in goals but they can only use their noses. When I retire from soccer I will keep kennels and breed dogs. I often go to a soho club."  Words: 180
