I live on a farm the size of it is 25 achers. I have been married for four years. I have to children they are twins, their names are [name] and [name], they are two and a half years old. On the farm I keep pigs, sheep, cattle and a few birds, (chicken, ducks, geese) The animals use twenty two achers and the other three achers we are growing grass and a few trees in for [name] and [name] and for friends when they come we can have our tea out on the grass. On a farm you can not go out so we can go out there and were still near to the animals. I love to be with animals. As a pet animal I like cats and dogs. The pigs, sheep, cattle and birds are just farm animals but I have pet as well, I have two cats three dogs, a horse, and a canery bird all of these are kept on the three acher and in the house.
