Every morning during the week, I would like to get out of bed at seven o'clock. I would then go into my two sons rooms and wake them up.
      For the next hour I would have a wash get dressed and get ready to take my children to school. After dropping them at school I would then go to my office in the [area], and I hope to be a lawyer and go to court sometimes. When I get back in the evening, I would like to read the Evening paper have dinner and go to the cinema.
      On Saturday morning I would like to go to Synagogue, and in the afternoon I would relax and watch Wrestling on the Television.
      On Sunday morning I would do the Sunday chores such as shopping and cleaning. In the afternoon I would relax and watch Television.  Words: 144
