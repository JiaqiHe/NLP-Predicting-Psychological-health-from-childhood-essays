I am twenty five, my name is [female name] [surname]. I work at a spoon factory. The factory is very large, there is about three hundred people who work in the factory. I pack the spoons, then I pass them along to another lady who stacts them in piles. I pack millions of spoons in a day. Sometimes I get bored at packing spoons.
I live at Rosebud cottage. I got two children on of them is three and other ones four. The one who is three is called [female name] and one who is four is [female name]. I live in a cottage with white washed walls and a thatch roof. Inside the cottage it is not very light. The lamp shade is orange, the table is made of wood and the curtains are deep red.
My cottage is by the sea, we live in Devon. I got a brother who lives in cornwall, and my mother and father live at Sunny cottage in Devon.
The things that interest me are swimming and doing needle work. Our family have got a pet puppy dig. My children have got a lovely big hilly garden to romp aound in, at the bottom of our garden is the beach. Down the road is a park with swings and deers in. I lead a happy life.  Words: 220
