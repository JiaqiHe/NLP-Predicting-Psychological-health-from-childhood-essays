Working at an office is sometimes very interesting I work quite hard and enjoy it. In my spare time I like painting and making things like dresses. Holidays seem a long way off from work and the things I have to do for the house. I like shopping and buying new clothes. At home I spend at lot of time gardening apart from cleaning the house up. Getting up at 7 o'clock every morning go to work at half past 8 wakes you up but I go to bed quite early. I am going to Cornwall for my holidays and I expect to laze around a bit I could just emagine me coming home with a bag full of presents.  Words: 120
