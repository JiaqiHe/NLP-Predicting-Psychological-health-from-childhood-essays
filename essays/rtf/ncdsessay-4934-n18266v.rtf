"I left training college four years ago after three and a half yers there. I maried an old school freind two weeks ago, and we are still honeymooning in Austria where I have always wanted to visit. Before this I taught amateur dramatics in a small school in the suburbs of Sheffield. While teaching I also wrote the auto-biography of a favourate author of my childhood this woman Elinor Brent-Dyer wrote the ""Chalet School"" series wich* I still cherish. It was from these books that I was given my prolonged ambition to visit Austria. Today my husband has proposed we live here for always. The healthy air and beautiful country-side prompted me to agree but I contained myself and asked if I could think about it. The next thing I did was to renew my interest in my stamps I now have quite a valuable colletion. This is mainly due from being a faithful member of the [town] Philatalic Services for fifteen years. The next week was full of hectic removals for we had decided after much consideration that we would stay here. I had founf employment in a school near where we were going to live once again it was to do with drama. Berne is a healthy town but I'm afraid my arithmetic is terrible I cant for the life of me remember all the prices. Then a couple of months after we had a child. A dark boy with black eyes and black hair. and nearly a year later we had triplets. Now it's time I gave up my job and started looking after the children."  Words: 269
