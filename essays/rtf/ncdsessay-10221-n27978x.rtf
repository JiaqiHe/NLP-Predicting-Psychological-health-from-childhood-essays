I enjoy my work and the people assosiated with it I often go out to interesting place's with friends or relitives I like watching ballet going on trains and on holidays. Going in the street at big citys* window shopping is one of my like. I don't mind doing the house-work as long as it pays off in the end, I like scrapping wallpaper off. I lead a happy and interesting life, try to make people happy and go about my business as I should. When I go out anywhere special like a wedding I try to buy a new outfit or shoes. I like gardening watching theseeds grow and looking after animals. I live in a bungalow with big gardens.  Words: 121
