I have a job as a office man, I will be mairred and have a child. In my week ends I would go and help the farmer near to me. I will have a car and I would go out to clubs, and if I get home early I would take my wife and child out for a treat. I will bring my wife a box of chocolates every Friday. I would live in a cottage in the country. I would carry on my father's job as a road safety officor and do his film shows still. I would not get a motor bicycle, for they a dangerous* and I would get a car every four years, so I will be safe on the road. All so I would get my car checked. I would show some films to my wife at night if I have them. I would have a cat and a dog. 
I will have a little garden with a apple tree and a flower bed. If I have a noth money I will buy my perant a house near the sea. And for my father I will get him a boat to go fishing in, And my mother a shalet* to sit in.
Of course, most of these things may not be here. I would not like to go to the moon, but some people must of gone then.  Words: 232
