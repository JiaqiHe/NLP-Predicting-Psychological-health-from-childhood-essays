I am in a college where I am working as an apprenticed engineer. The managers name is Mr [name] and he is very strict. I go fishing in the lake every Saturday I can. When I'm at home I make plastic models or look at my stamp collection. I live in a flat overlooking the sea. I have many friends We all go to a club, one day in the week. I am the top engineer and the manager thinks I am the best engineer he has had. I also study chemistry and science and I enjoy it.  Words: 98
