I am now engaged. I lead a life as a secratary. Many times during the day I sit back and think of all my childhood. I think of the funny jokes that the girls used to make and think of what they would say if they saw me now. Teacher's come back into my mind. I remember Mrs [name] in the infants and Mr [name] in the Juniors.
      My work at home is mostly bound round houswork and cooking. My favourite interests now are cooking and ice-skating. I go to the ice-rink quite frequently and meet some of my freinds there. In cooking many of the recipes come back to mind and of how we used to cook. I very well remember the time when we made the very nice rock-cakes. I think of the very nice outing's that we went on with the school. But oh' dear time is running out for thinking of the past and I now have to write a letter to my new head-man, or boss. I will soon be leaving this office that I am in now and will be going to a bigger and better one at Bristol. From my age (25) right down to my childhood in school I can honestly say that I enjoyed every minuete of it and I really wish that I had just started my school-days.
      Here now comes my head-man. He wants me to write a letter to a solisitor. Out comes my. writing pad and pencil. And away goes my hand writing word from word. My thoughts sometimes cheer me up, whenever I think of school.  Words: 270
