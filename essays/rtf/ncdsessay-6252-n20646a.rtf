Whe I am twenty five years old. I would like to be marred. and have a cottage. I would like my jod to de in a drees* shop. I would like to show the people the dresses. In my house I would like two bedrooms and a kitchen and a liveing room. I want to bedrooms so I can have some of my frends to stay for a night. I do not want my pets only a fold fichs in a gold fish colur*. For my holidays I would like to go Spain and abroad. In my ward*d I would like lots of clothes and shoes to wear.

Out side the cottage door a little wooden seat and flowers all around the cottage door.  Words: 201
