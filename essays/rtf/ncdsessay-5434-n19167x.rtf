"I'm just going out to feed the dogs wich are very large Great Danes and are wimming champions.
As I got back the toast was burning and I quickly hurried over to it. My husband had just got dressed and shaved and he quickley drink is coffee said goodbye and drove off the work.
Today was the day of one of my dogs grand final in a well known show. Vicount the dog was a very well bred dog and very large, but before I could get him ready the housework had to be done the upstairs was done and the louge so it jsut left the the kitchen so I washed up and tidied up then let the dogs out clearly out of the stampeded I caught hold of Vicount and started to get him ready first I checked his feet and nails also his ears, nose and eyes then I clipped any long hair that was hanging about. Then I reached out for the comb and combed the tangle's out of his fur and then I started to brush his coat until It shone.
When we reached the show theere were many healthy dogs there but will though we might get some were.
First of all it was an obiedence test he did that allright then it was time to parade round and the judge began.
""All right I'll feed you and a special big feed for you for wimming that cup Vicount""."  Words: 240
