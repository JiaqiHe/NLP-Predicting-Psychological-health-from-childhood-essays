When I am 25 my intrests will be gardening Golf, tennis and other sports and I hope to be working in a bank and to be married. I'll like travelling and hope to have a car. I hope to have a house on the outskirts of the town. I hope to have a garden, front and back, and hope to have quite a big house well worth looking at, a three bedroomed house with a loft and hope to lead a resonably happy life. I hope to be good at my work and look well in appearence, to be physically fit and not to suffer from any bad illnesses. To have a few pets a dog and some budgerigars. To have a well decotated house and proper facilities.  Words: 137
