"When I am 25 years of age I would like to be a short hand typisted or start learning When I have left school and If I'n brainy When I've left College. If I Could not be a short hand typested I would not like to be a ""Shop assitant"" I would try to get a office in london doing Somethings but not selling anything. I don't know If I want to get Married or not.
I could Buy a house that is uassully It you got married you could bye a house because they are a lot of money.
I might be a teacher but I don't think I could be because I've not got all that many brains.
My interests would be trying to ride a car, I would like to be Quiet a lot of things but aspeicly typisted Maybe a swimming Champion but I don't think I can swim fast enough for that.
