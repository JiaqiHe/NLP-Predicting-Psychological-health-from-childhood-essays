I am now 25 years old and have become a teacher. I live at home with my parents and go to work in my car every day to the school in the next town . The school is a Primary School and I teach 5 year old children in there first year at the Primary School . The children begin to learn to read and write and I like this very much. They can also play and the work is not too serious . When they get out of school I do the shopping for my mother , then go home. I go to bed at round about ten so i get plenty of sleep for the next day at school. at school we do plenty of handwork every day and go to Gymm twice or three times a week. Sports day is always good fun when they do all kind of races . I get nice long holidays and have been aburoad a few times on tours to learn about different countries and their ways of living in hot and cold weather . it also gives me new ideas for school . Sometimes I go with my parents and sometimes I go alone. 
Other good things at school is concerts through out the year when we can teach the children new songs and poems and even teach some to dance . The children all love this and also like Prize giving D ay although the infants do not get prizes . I am not married and don't kn** if I want to or not but I would like ** have a child or even twins . If I ever got tired of teaching infants I would move on to a different class if I could I also like painting and sewing and going camping and going for cycle runs in the country . Occasionly I go sailing and sometimes play an instrument . I like being a teacher and I don't think I shall ever change mind about that as if I did I could always return to that job .  Words: 352
