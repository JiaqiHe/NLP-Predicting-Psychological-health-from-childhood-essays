When i am 25 i Hope to be able to lead a normle life and have no more than 4 children, at the moment i like games very much, but I'm not very good at it. I like tennis very much althoug I have only had 3 games all won by my sister, but I know I'll never be any good. I think I would like to live in the small town of [town] where my mother comes from I would like to call my children [female name]-[female name] or [female name]-[female name] or if boys [male name] [male name] or [male name] [male name], I'm not certain about what I should do for a liveing because I don't know wether or not I should get a shop when I'm married. I think it would be sastisfying if I was a normle house wife, but my father thinks I might be able to be come a long jumper, if I was a long jumper I would try to get into the olimpic games and try to win a medle. or then I might try a little bit of swimming but I'm not to keen on that but what I really like doing is rounders but I think Ill not be to keen when I'm 25, I think I shall like to do a little bit of acting I dont really think I shall be able to do all these things but I do hope I can do at least one thing and that is to live in [town] and to buy a shop. and gave no more than 4 children.
