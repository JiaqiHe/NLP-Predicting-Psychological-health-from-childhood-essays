I live in the country in a Tudor Cottage which has a very big garden, in the garden there is a fairly large telescope from which I look at the stars and planets. I own a helicopter for going to [city] and I have a collection of very old armour. I often write looks on Astronermy and Historical Novels, and sometimes I write science fiction. I also own a Radio Telescope. I often visit castles and historical houses. There is a river quite near the house and a village. I'own a small libairy in the house, I have a television and I watch it reguly as America has launched a rocket to Mars. I do all the gardening myself and grow vegtables potatoes and some tomatoes in a hot-house. The lawn is quite large and there is an ANTIQUE statue in the centre.  Words: 143
