I am twenty five years old. I have long brown hair and I am about 5ft 3ins. My eyes are brown and I have fairly long black eye-lashes. When I am at home I usually in my spare time read a book. Other times I make the meals or sometimes on Friday or Saturday I go out. I have three children two girls and one boy. I am training to be a teacher. Soon I will be a proper teacher and that will be my job. I have many interests like reading and sawing but my main interest is dancing. I enjoy dancing very much. At Christmas time my husband and I go out. When we go to visit people we take the children with us. My two girls are called [female name] and [female name] my boy's name is [male name]. At night we all sit near the fire watching television and some times we all have a cup of tea. I have two pets one is a kitten which I call Fluff and the other is a puppy boxer dog which I call Bruno. They are both boys and they are very cute. Fluffy and Bruno love to be petted. Fluffy like sitting in the chair with me and Bruno like going to sleep on my feet. I think twenty five is a very nice age to be.  Words: 230
