I am now twenty five year's old and travel to work every morning. Makeing new friends and Seeing the old people, helping the Sick and comforting the old. The life I am leading is interesting the poeple I meet and the one's I work with, Some are happy and may be sad, when the day is over I travel home go out and See the sight's that surrond's me then travel home I go to bed and dream about the thing's that * might happen. The next morning I will Start my day of work at home and at my job it my be very busy or may be it will be quite. Poeple may fuss about and get in the way, They might be in a bad moud and be nasty and un help ful and not do there job.  Words: 141
