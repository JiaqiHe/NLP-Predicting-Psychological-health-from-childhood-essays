When I am 25 years old I would like to be a shop assistant. I would like to be married and have about three children. Living in a bungalow would be nice. I would be living a pleaseant life and would not smoke.
The children I would like to have are two girls and a boy. I would be out shopping nearly every day and I would be very busy.
I think I shall be interested in swimming still though.
I will also be reading quite alot and will also have alot of housework to do, and washing to keep up with. I will have to do cooking as well, I supporse I will have to do gardening.  Words: 115
