----------------------
I am now 25 years old and have just signed a contract with Bradford P A for two seasons. I like it here and I think I will renew my contract at the end of the two seasons. I am married and have 1 child. I have a house in Leeds which makes things awkward for me getting to training sessions. I also run a newsagent shop in Leeds and the biusness is prospirous. It is a semi detatched house that I live in and I have a Ford Cortina car.
I made my league debu on April 4th against Portsmouth for Bradford. I played quite well I thought, but did make some mastakes. WHen I retire from football I want to become either a Manager or a referee.
My father helped me to be a footballer. He's the manager of West Bromwich Albion He got the manager of Bradford Park Avenue to give me a trial and that is how I got into the Bradford Park Avenue first team. I have only scored 1 goal in three maches that mainly because I am a full-back or sometimes center half. I have not been able to play in for a fortnight through injury.  Words: 201
