I hope that as a job I would be a pilot of a VC,10, in my spare time I would still stamp collect (manly British) I hope to be come a black belt in Judo and help to teach boys (maybe girls) to learn it. The flights would be from London-to-Majorca via, France that I hope is all after University. I hope I would be leading a happy life and I would not have any financial divacoltes (say with my bank maniger) and I would have enough mony to buy an E type 'Jag'. I would NOT have a wife but maybe a girl-friend and live a strat life maybe I might go into policts if the countrys is deat*.  Words: 120
