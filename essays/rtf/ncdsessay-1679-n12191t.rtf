I am 25 years and I have a lovely house in Australia I am married, I have two dogs (poodles), one budge and a tortoise. I live very near a swimming pool and I go swimming every evening because I love swimming
The house has six rooms, two bedrooms one dinning room, a lounge, a television room and a kitchen. There is a very big garden with a pond, a garden shed, and a green house. We have have a potato patch and a flower patch. In the middle of the garden there is a place where we sun bath. Some- times I go to partys, near my house. I have a job in an office, as a secatary. My husband also hsa a good job so we are alright for money.  Words: 131
