At the age of 25 I will be married. I will be working as a 'veteran surgeon'. I will have a lot of animals. I will want a house out in the country. I will own a car and every fine Sunday afternoon I will go out for a run in the country. My house will be a bungalow with three bedrooms. I hope to have three children two girls and a boy. My pets will be two dogs (a chiwawa and a pekineze) An aquarium, three budgerigars, two mice and a hamster. The garden of my house will be very big with lawns and flower beds. I will want my house to be near a park for my children. I will take them there every fine Saturday afternoon. Every Sunday morning I will take my children to church. I will want my husband to be a keen gardener.  Words: 149
