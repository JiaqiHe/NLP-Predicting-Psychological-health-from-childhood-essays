When i am 25 years of age I would like to be a hairdresser so that I would be able to learn how to do all different sorts of modern hair styles and learn how to do perms and Curls on top. If I was a hairdresser I would let all my relations have their hair done for nothing easpecilly my own family. I would not let all my friends have their hair done for nothing but I would let them have it done for half price.  Words: 87
