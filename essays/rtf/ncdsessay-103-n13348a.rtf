I am living in a large country estate. It is about 100 acres square In it there is a zoo of rare animals and birds. From this I got £150 in a week There is also a hotel on the estate and this gets me £200 a week. I often go on safaries to Africa to get more animals for the zoo. I am stedily building a village around the edges of my estate. At the moment I have 150 houses and a sammon and trout lake with every kind of fish in it. Any body can fish in the lake and I (charge) charge 3/6 d per day. I have been married for 4 years and my wife is [xxxxxxx] and she is a vet.
