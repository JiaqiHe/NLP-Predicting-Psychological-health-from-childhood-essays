"I am an actress my live is very hard but good pay . It is very interesting, you meet many famous people.
I like working as an actress because I enjoy singingand dancing very much .
My home live is a happy one you have good things to do and I love doing things. My family always enjoy things even my dog (name). We like swimming , dancing , singing and playing instruments.
I like acting because it is exciting and you travel all round the world and you have plenty of money and buy modern clothes and you have beautiful furnitute and a beautiful house in which to live. It is not nice to be away from home but your really enjoyed yourself very much. I have seen many of Julie andrew's film and when I saw ""The Sound of Music"" that is when I wanted to act when I was a little girl. I liked many of Julie andrews films but the best was ""The Sound of Music"". I have seen ""Oliver"" and that was very good too. In each film you make you get baout xxxx10,000 you also must practice in the week and we have a rehearsel for 6 hours every week. Then after three hours of practice you go and have a drink of juice and a sandwich and the back to rehearsel for the rest of another 3 hours. You do this for seven days and then your are about ready. Its a great live ."  Words: 249
