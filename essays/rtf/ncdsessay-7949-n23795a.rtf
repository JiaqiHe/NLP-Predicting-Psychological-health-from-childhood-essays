I work as an aircraft designer at the [aviation company] in Bristol. I live in a flat in the centre of Bristol with a friend called [male name] [surname]. I was once a teacher at a Primary school in London. Then, I became an Aircraft designer and moved to the [aviation company] in Bristol. At home I make balsa wood Aeroplanes and fly them when I go camping at Dartmoor. Last year I went on holiday to Germany. In my job I have to visit other aircraft factories and look at their designs. Sometimes we have a partnership and I work with someone else on a job. Sometimes I visit my family who now live in a house on the south coast. I drive a new car with a speed of 120 m.p.h.
