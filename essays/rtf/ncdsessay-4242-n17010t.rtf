I am a model going from place to place. Sometimes I have an odd few minutes now and again. My job is very hard but I don't mind it. I hope I will become a very high model and work for some very rich lady. I read a lot infact nearly every spare minutes I get. Being a model is not so easy work. You have got to learn to walk properly. I am very intrested about designing clothes to model. Every Saturday my busiest day of the week. I have to put on a new wig buy new make-up. It is quite a rush. The other models are very nice to me as I am new there. Once a year I see my parents. Before I go home I go into some shops and buy some presents for mum and dad, Staying at home I helped mum. In a weeks time I had to pack my cases and of once more. It was all the same going here and going there. And finally I my dreams had come true A rich lady had come true. I worked for a rich lady called Madam Smith. SHe paid me well xxxx30 a month. Which is a good pay and one day because I modeled so well she gave me xxxx50 a month. Then I went to Spain and Italy all overy the world I am now a rich lady myself. I now employ me own models. They will learn everything about modeling as I did.  Words: 254
