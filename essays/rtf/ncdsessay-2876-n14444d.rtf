I am 25 years old and have a bungalow on my own. My job is a secatary at a bank and I am paid well. I have a great interest in window boxes and pot plants and I can have a nice assorment* of flowers as my fiancie owns a garden shop. My bungalow has two bedrooms and in the rooms are beds which come down from the wall. There are two other rooms. The living is all central heated and is nice and large. My kitchen is mostly electic with fitted lino. In the living room a passage leads to other places. The hall leads to the varanda where I keep my flowers. Next week is a very special week in mylife as on Monday is my wedding day and I am going on honeymoon to Torquay.  Words: 138
