I am know twenty five years old and I have been at school and am know a teacher at a Primary School and I am just getting to know the children and other teachers. 
I have got a great many hobbies and the one I like best is shooting. 
I am still living with my parents and I have got a car which I go to school in every morning.
I have got another hobby which is woodwork, and at the moment I am saving up for a laith so that I can make things like ash tray stands and other things.
In the evenings I sometimes do a little gardening for my father. I am soon going to to get married as I am ingaged. In the summer I am going for a holiday to Denmark, I will have to save up my money though.  Words: 144
