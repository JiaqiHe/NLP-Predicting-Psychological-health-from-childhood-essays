----------------------
I would not long have left school and I would like to go to a job as a short hand typist. I would like to work in a big office with my boss.
I would like to go places enjoy life while I can. Stay single as long as possible and just go out with boys just about my age.
I would like to be able to go to the cinema and see good films, and see life as it really is. 
I would not just sit around waiting for boys to come and take me out I would earn money and treat myself. Blow the boys if they have not got the decency to come and take a girl out. I hope that I will be a lot more prettier and a lot more thinner by the time I am twenty five. I will join the fashion and go to countries abroad if I can and see what their fashion is. I might even take a trip around the world. I will earn the money somehow if I do not get enough I will work at to jobs and as well as being a typist I will get a part time job. I will think about marriage and all that stuff later on in life. Until then I will not throw my life away waiting for some handsome beau to come but if I did find one quite soon in life we would go on dates together e.g. Dinner dates, parties and all that jazz.
