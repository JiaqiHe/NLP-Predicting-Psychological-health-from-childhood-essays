I am living in the country three miles from the nearest village. My husband [name], goes to work in a shop down in the village. For a pastime I board dogs and we have two of our own both Spanials. My husbang and I have three children [name], the oldest, he is ten, then [name] she is seven and [name] he is five. I have a big house and a lady comes in on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays to help clean and polish the rooms. The cook [name] has the kitchen all to herself and she only lets Bunty and Buster (the dogs) in. I do most of the working when it comes to the dogs but the children often take them out. We grow vegetables in one part of the garden, we have a lawn at the back of the house and round the edge are the dog kennels and pens, ten big ones.
      About a mile up the road we have some neighbours Mr and Mrs [name] who have no children but a cat. Their cat Sooty is alway coming here and it sets the dogs off barking. Then she has the cheek to complain about the noise, so one day I told her to keep her cat out of the way or else I'd let the dogs out. Now her cat still comes but when the dogs bark and make a noise she never complains. The children go to the village school every day so they are out of my way. On thursdays [name] closes the shop then comes home. He often takes the dogs out if the children are at school.  Words: 275
