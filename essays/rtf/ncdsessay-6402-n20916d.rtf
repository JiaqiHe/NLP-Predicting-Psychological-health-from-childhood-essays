I am settled down in a good job as an air hostess and I am happily married to Pilot [surname] who is the pilot of my airorplane. I like my job and I meet all sorts of people sometimes Lords and Ladies and some who have outstanding personality and children who have great ambitions about being air hostess like me, but I had to learn French, Italian + Spanish and I had to study a lot. Sometimes important buisness men come onto the areoplane and of course many foriegn people come. I was very scared when I first went up and I was very dizzy when I looked out of the plane. I go on holidays abroad usually and I enjoy going to Majorca or the Scilly Isles. I often go home to my parents and they enjoy my visits, I bring continetal recipes home and Mexican hats and things like that. I make many friends of the air hostess's and sometimes I go out with them to fancy dinning places where we have caviar and wines.
I serve tea and coffee on the plane and I dont spill it any more after the training we had. We had to learn to look nice all the time and to look settled when it is difficult circumstances. I like to go Ice Skating when I'm with my parents and I love to try and do hard turns and twists. I also skate with my husband [male name]. We do dances together and we went into a competition and won 3rd prize. I like horse riding when I have the time though I don't do much more than sit in the saddle.  Words: 279
