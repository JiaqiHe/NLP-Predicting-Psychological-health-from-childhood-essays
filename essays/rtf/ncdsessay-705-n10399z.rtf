I live in a little farm house in the country, it has a little wood behind it and a large feild in front of it. The house is quite big, inside. In the morning I help to milk the cows and then they go in the feild in front of the house, the after tea they all come back in to get milked and go back into the feild. I do that every morning. Then I go in and make the breakfast. After breakfast I go outside and wash up the milking things. The I clean up the house and get dinner ready. Sometimes I am out in the hay feild they are at the side of the large feild in front of the house, and the is some behind the wood. The wood is divied in to two parts. After the hay, it is just about time for the cows to stay in the byre. And that means more hard work in the winter. We have a very hard winter, because we get a lot of snow and sometimes can not get out for two weeks or so. And we have to see if there is any sheep birried in thesnow and can't get out. About April it is lambing time and some of the lambs are born in the snow. And have to be brought in to the house beside the fire. After ward I take them back out to their mothers. Their mothers are in the hayshed and she gets a pail of water and some cake and hay. And then it comes to summer and hay time again. So it is a very had life living on a farm. And this happen every year.  Words: 288
