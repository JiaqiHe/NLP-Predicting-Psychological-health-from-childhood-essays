I am not marrid but I am thinking of getting marrid when the wright girl comes along. My job is a makanic mending the moon tractors. When I have got enough money I will buy my own moon house and my own space ship. When the wright girl comes along I will ask her to marry me then we will just come back to earth for our honeymoon. Our honey moon will be about two mounth long when it is up I will get our roket ship prepeard to talk off from the space sentour. When my wife and I get back to the moon I will introduse her to my friends and relatives. We will have the moon house painted a yellow ish colour because if any body gets lost he will be able to see the glow of the moom house. When we have got setled in I will show her the place were I work. If she has a boy we will call it [name] if she has a girl we will call it [name]. But if she has twins we will call them [name] and [name].  Words: 190
