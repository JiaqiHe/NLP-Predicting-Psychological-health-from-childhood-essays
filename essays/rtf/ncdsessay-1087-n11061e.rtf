I am now 25 years old and I am a dressmaker. When I am at home I enjoy my spare time knitting and cooking. My main intrests are knitting, sewing, chrocheting. I like designing clothes, I own a clothes shop and I sell most styles of clothes. I enjoy sewing up the clothes I have designed for my shop. I have a very nice time swwing the clothes on my sewing machine. I have decided not to get married just yet because a husband wouldn't be able to help anyhow. If I do get married I will have a white wedding and I will still keep my same job unless it is nessasary that I have to give it up. If I get married I would like to have two girls; I would dress them alike because two children always look nice when they are wearing the same clothes. I could make their clothes myself if I was still a dressmaker. It would be easy to make the same clothes if they were twins. I would still make clothes even if I didn't work in the dressmaker shop.  I would be able to buy skirt lengths and make nice winter skirts. I could make my own dresses and clothes. That is just about all that I could possibly think of, just at this minute. My husband would have to be hard working to keep us through the week.  Words: 238
