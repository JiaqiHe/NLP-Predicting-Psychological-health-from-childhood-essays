I work in the Navy, I enjoy it but I like to come home and see my family. Travelling around the world is a great thing, seeing differant countrys and meeting new people but we have to work hard aswell. I am the navigator, this job is'nt too hard as long as you know eveything. In the spare time I get I like to have a Swim, sleep and a game of some sort. When we go ashore I bye presents for the family and sometimes have a drink in a Pub or Milk-bar. When we come back home and see our familys again everybody is joyfull and I make the most of it while I can. I give them their presents and they useually give me something aswell, sometimes clothes and sometimes food and drink. When I go back on board the ship my family come and bid goodbye until the time when we meet again. On this journey I will be away a whole year, but this is nothing of a suprise to me or my family. Back to work again and a long day ahead or a long year for that matter. At night I watch television and have a good laugh with the rest of the crew. I useually go to sleep about 9, oclock so that I have enough sleep before the next day. I like my job but I sometimes get a bit feverish with astma because of the heat, but I have had asthma since I was a small boy of six years of age. I love the fresh sea air and the seagulls crying over head*. When I first joined the Navy I felt a bit sea-sick but that soon wore off.  Words: 290
