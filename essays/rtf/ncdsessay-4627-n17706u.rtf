I am married to a engineer . I have three children. We have a very happy life. We live in a house which we have brought. It is three miles away from where I work. I am a nurse. The nursing life is very exicting. I mostly help in operations. I also do some stitching on some serious cuts. My intrestes in life are swimming and ice - skating. I go swimming one week in my spare time and ice - skating the next. My children also like swimming and ice - skating. They are aged five four and three . At this age they are always making a mess which I have to clear up. I have all modern furniture in my house and the wall-paper is white and a messy green. The house is in the middle of a very big garden, which is hard work for my husband. My husband has made the children a toy house so they can play with it. The children are all girls. Every year we go on holiday. This year we are going to spain. We have a car which is a blue cortina. This will take us to the place we are staying in spain when we have landed . I have been to ireland, Austria, Turkey and Sweden. I love this life and hope it carries on for much longer.  Words: 231
