I am a housewife I have two children. I like takeing my children to Horse Jumping shows and I like going skating which is my best pastime. I am an air hostess on the B.K.S. aeroplanes. The last time we flew we went to Spain. and on our way back we nearly ran out of fuel so the pilot radioed to Heathrow airport in London. The plane landed and got enough fuel to last us until we were at [town] airport. I like cooking in my spare time and I also like shopping. At nights when I am not working or watching the television I read books.  Words: 107
