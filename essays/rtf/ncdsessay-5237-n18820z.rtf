I am a student at **** school. I am helping the teacher in class C2. My interests outside school hours are swimming and elocution. I will nac** be all to teach elocution if I wish. I am still studying hand to be a teacher. I want to get married at twenty-eight. My home life is quiet, but on Fridays and Wednesdays I go out and other nights I look after friends children while they go out. Sometimes father and mother go out for the day and then I look after the house and cook. On saturdays I help in a shop in **** when there is no school, I quite enjoy doing this. I will be an instructor in swimming in a weeks time and I hope I find that interesting. The subjects I am most interested in are history and Geography. When I am a teacher I hope to teach these subjects, including English.  Words: 155
