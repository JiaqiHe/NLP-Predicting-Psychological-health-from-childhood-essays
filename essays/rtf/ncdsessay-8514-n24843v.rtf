That is *** I Dont get playing for any teams Iff I should get married I would give my wife xxxx25 for her house keeping money. I would try not to argue with her . When my holidays come I would go to spain or any place we it is sunny. I would choose a lovely hotel were we could live. And every day I would go and swim in the water. Sometimes I would take my wife to the pictures and dances or parties. I would live in a bungalo because I could B*y it and then it would be all mine . I would not buy a corpoaration house because you would always have to pay your rent .  Words: 166
