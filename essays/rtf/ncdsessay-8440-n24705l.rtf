I am on my way to work I am to be a waitres in a restrant. Ho, I am to late I mist the bus. All that day I was running back and forword geting meals and bringing plates back. I was glad wen it was time to go home because my feet were worn out. When I got home my mother asked me how I got on in the job, I told her it was not to bad a least they gave me good pay. At the end of the week the manager gave me my pay. When I got home I gave my mother six pound along with the money I owed her. That night I done the washing for my mother and clined out the kitchen and bathroom. Next morning I got up early and made mum her break-fast and a cup of tea. A week after that I went out with the girl who worked with me. As we were sitting on the beach in a park she told me that she was going to be a model she ask me why I had not tryed to be one she told me that you get plenty of pay for it. That night I told my mother that I was going to try for a job as a model she did not like the idia of it at first but I finally became a model.  Words: 270
