I am just going to work I work as a pilot in space* today-day I am going to do a normal flight to the moon and then back again with some samples. I like this work as it is interesting to me and I have liked space work I am not married and do not think I am going to marry. When I am going to marry. When I have days of I do my hobbies which are birdwatching mostly but sometimes fishing. At night I go on to the roof of the house and use the telescope which stands up the*e. 
I do not have many days off and a friend lives in the house most* of the time a few weeks ago I returned from a trip to mars and back in about 3 months. I am due to do another trip in about * months time. In* space I do not get homesick because I feel a scapecraft* is my home as I spend more time in space than I do earth. Above all it is just a job once you get used to it. In between journeys in space I fly as a test pilot for B.O.A.C and this is just as dangerous as it is in space. I *o sum it all I am satisfid with the life I'm leading.  Words: 225
