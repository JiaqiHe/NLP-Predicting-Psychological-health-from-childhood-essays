----------------------
I would not be married and I expect I will be living in a flat (probably near London) and I might be still at University but if I was not I would be teaching or something, more likely actually I would be working for some firm in London. I will not be doing anything spectacular but I hope to have a good income on which to support 1 wife and family. I would hope to have some hobbies such as playing cricket and *eve**l others I might well have a car and probably a house in some island such as Matta GC. At home I would probably have about two rooms; but I would probably spent all day practically at work.  Words: 121
