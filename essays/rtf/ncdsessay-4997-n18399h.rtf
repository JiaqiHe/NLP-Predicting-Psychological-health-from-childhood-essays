Now I am 25 I am maried and live in a nice house. I have a good job working for a big oil company where I get enough money to pay for the house and save. Going to college was a good thing I think I learnt a great many things that I did not know. 
      I still have the same interests in sport especily football and cricket that I had when I was at my primary school. With a good job I am sure that I will learn everything and improve my position and hope that my work will help people some-where and then I will feel pleased with myself for this deed.  Words: 115
