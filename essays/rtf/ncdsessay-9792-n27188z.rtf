When I'm Twenty-five.
      When I'm twenty five I will be married and have a baby boy who I hope well support [football club] if he dose I would take him to see them play if my wife would let me. Thats if I was not playing for a team my-self. On sundays he would go to church. I would work at the bank where my dad used to word called [bank].
      My wife will have long blond hair. I would be leading a hard live if I did not get the Job at a bank I would have a car so that I could take my son a wife out for rides to my mother and farther. I would have a house in the country or if I had anou*h money I would have a Manson where our mother's and farther's would live with us in the flats joined on to the house with a garden of two acres. 
      I would collect guns from the army and I would have birds in avores in the garden and I would buy a puppy for my son and have a big kitchen for my wife. In the garden we would have a swimming pool and a climbing frame for my son.  Words: 210
