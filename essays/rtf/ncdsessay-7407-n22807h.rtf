looking after [female name]. I don't enjoy too much cleaning up, but I don't mind it either. In the afternoon a 12 o clock when I fetch [male name], we sometimes go for a picnic lunch on the common. Afterwards [male name] and [female name] are usually so tired that I put them to bed and can get on with my housework. Once per week I go to sewing classes, where I make dresses for myself and clothes for [female name] and [male name].
One of my hobbies is doing the garden, which I do on Saturdays and Sundays. [male name] usually goes to one of his friends on Saturdays, or the friend comes over here. [female name] stays at home, playing in the garden with a ball.
My husband and me sometimes go sailing on the thames in our Mirror On the whole I like this life very much, and would not change it for anyone elses, theough it does sometimes have its problems.  Words: 165
