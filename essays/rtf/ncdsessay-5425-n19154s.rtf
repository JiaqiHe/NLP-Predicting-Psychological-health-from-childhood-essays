My live at twenty five would consist of this. I would be an designer and design new craft's for the world, like new cars, boats. I would work on these things from 9 oclock am. to 5 oclock P.m. My main interest would be sports, these I will abroad to get ideas for my designing. Evenining I would go to cinemas and get ideas. If I could I would by a house in the country where I would work in peace. I would adventure a lot and visit freinds. I would marry and hope to have children.  Words: 97
