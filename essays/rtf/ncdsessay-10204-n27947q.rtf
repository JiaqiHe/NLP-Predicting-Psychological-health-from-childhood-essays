I live in a city just outside (place) My husband works as a mathmatishan in a rocket factory and I work in a supermarket. We have no children. On Saturday there is a garden fate which every one in the city must attened to re*seve a merit for there children's work.
We live in a very modern house come bungelow with all the modern convenesays. We have two bedrooms, a kitchen. breakfast room, living room, bathroom and toilet . We have very comfetable furniture. The chairs are swivel and some of them are blew up. We sleep in round beds.
Each morning my husband goes to work in a sports car and I go on a no man bus . I have to be in work by 8 O'clock to serve the busy shoppers. Today there is a new brand of washing up liquid comeing in and with it they are giving a free table of soap.
My mother and father live in a cottage on the coast and we go to viste* them every Sunday.
In three weeks time we will be going on our holidays to Switzerland where we will stay in a first class chalet where we will be waited on.
At home I like to sit and watch telivision in the evenings or I like to make my own clothes which I think is much cheaper the buying them. So this is how I spend my time .  Words: 237
