I am a vet and have many custermers. I have a wife and one child called [name] who is three years of age.
Some animals which come into my surgery are usually quite badly hurt. They often have been run over by cars, Some have eaten something which is not good for them, others have fallen into rivers. 
My son [name] goes to a nursery school and he is learning to read, he is very happy there.
We have a pet she is a cat called Tibb. She is a big black cat with bright green eyes. She will not eat tinned food like other cats but she has to have the fish that is brought from the fishmonger. We are all a happy family and get on well together.  Words: 128
