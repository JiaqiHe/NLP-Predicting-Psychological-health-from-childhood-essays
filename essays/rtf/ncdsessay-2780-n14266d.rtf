I get up in the mornig at eight o,clock and drive to [city] in my car. when it is rainings as I go on my way to [city] I feel rather dull and tired. And when it is sunny and bright I feel rather cheerfull. There is very nice contry on the way to [city] I often stop for a short time and pause to look at the country side and read a book in the cool sun shine. Then I start on way again. I arrive in [city]. about 9 o,clock and collage* ends at fives. I start on my way back home to have my tea and sit down to watch the television. Then about seven o,clock my freind [name] comes around. and together we go out for a meal and drink. after we finish our meal we pay* our bill and start to drive home we get home roughly about ten o,clock then I go to bed at half past ten.
