----------------------
I am leading a normal life really. I am married and live in a bungelow. There is a small front garden, but quite a big back garden. The view from the garden is a field with corn planted in and far away in the distance is a railway line, where we often see trains pass.
I don't mind gardening, and I do it quite often. I have already passed my driving test, and I have a mini van, and my husband has a ford cortina which I some-times drive. My mini van is quite usful when I need to hurry to work. I work at the Ipswich Emploment exchange.  Words: 108
