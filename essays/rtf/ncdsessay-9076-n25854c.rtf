When I leave school I will look for a job. When I have got a job I will get up have breackfast and set off for work. After my job. I will go out and go to visit aunts and uncles and perhaps go fishing with uncles. I might get a car with my wages and ride in the country every now and then. Then I will go to the swimming baths every weekend. Monday, Tuesday, wednesday, Thursday and Friday I do my work. I will finish my job every night finish at six as usual and go to places. I also will do woodwork making. Then I will do all kinds of things, like cycling, fishing, football and swimming.  Words: 120
