"     Now I am twenty five I have got married and have two children, A boy and a girl. The girl is eight and the boy not yet one! My husband is not rich nor poor, but is very kind indeed. He works at a bank (Loyds). We are very happy together and are well-off. We have a cottage by the sea so it takes only five minutes to get to the beach. The girl is a good swimmer. (she is called Isobell), but the boy (David) has never been in the sea, but stays on the beach with me (in his cot). 
     My life consists entirely of the family and often we have my family and ""Roger's"" to stay with us and we all enjoy it!
     Before I got married I went into nursing and I am still very interested in it. I collect stamps when I get the time, what with one thing and another!
     The baby is very good and is soarely seen crying. Though I spend a lot of time playing and tending to him*. I realy enjoy life and seem to live on the beach nealy every afternoon. Each morning I do all the housework and fead the baby. I let Isobell take David for a walk along the beach."  Words: 216
