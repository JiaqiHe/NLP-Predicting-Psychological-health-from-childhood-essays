I,d like to be a teacher work at [school name] Girls School teach the girls cooking, sewing and house craft. Be home for 5 o'clock get changed do my dinner and go to the pictures. Be home for 9 o'clock do some of the girls sewing. Go to bed at 10 o'clock get up at 6 o'clock in the morning have my breakfast. Go to school learn the children History go for my morning coffee. At 11 o'clock blow the whistle tell the children about sound about how your ears vibrate. Then I'd go to dinner and have some coffee and biscuit then I'd go home get some other shoe's on. Then come back to school and go back to my classroom and do the register. Then at playtime go on yard duty blow the whistle. Then go into the hall for P.E. and at 4 o'clock go home and go out and go to the Cinema and come back home and go to bed. And have some supper and then in the morning come to school and teach the Girl's how to bake  Words: 184
