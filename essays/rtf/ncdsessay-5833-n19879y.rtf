I am 25 years old and have just finished college to be a surgeon, now I have to go to a training school where I will learn how to do simple opperation's later on when I am about 27 I will get married, when I am on holiday I may have to be called to the hosipital when I am sixty I will retire and have a pension, it will be handy to know about first-Aid in case of an accident. When my career is finished there won't be much* for me to do, so I will probaly go on a few holiday's and I hope I get elected to be a couciler or be a J.P. (Justise of the Peace) by that time there won't be much left of my life so there's not much left to do. I suppose I,ll take up a few hobbies and enjoy life the best I can.  Words: 154
