When I am twenty I would like to be a shopassitant a full time one. I might be married if I have a boyfriend I would go out with him. I would go bed at a about half past ten. I would help mum do the house work before I go to work I would try to work my best so that I could learn a lot of money, and I would save my money to go on holidays and other things like that If I was married and had any children I would like two girls so that they could play with each other and they woldn't be lonely.
