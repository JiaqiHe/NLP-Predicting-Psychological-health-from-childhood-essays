I am twenty five years old and I live in London in a very nice road. i am a charted accoumtant working for a big firm in (town). My interests are in models and painting Airfix miniture soldiers. I am also inter-ested in finding out about the American civil war and looking up in books for this information.
At home I do many things. I am married and enjoy coming home at night and seeing my wife. I also enjoy my work that I do but sometimes I ask for some leave to go on holiday. It is not normally French leave !.
When I come home at night I usually have a hot bath. I have a good dinner, for my wife is a good cook. After dinner I often watch the television for at my house I have a television. If there is nothing good on the television, I go to my room and read a book, or do some painting of soldiers.
The sort of book I enjoy most are historical books such as War and peace. At work I work in a high building of which my office is on the seventh floor. My office has - four walls and is a very comfortable room in my opinion.
I have a young secratary who has a room leading from my room I usually shut the door because I do not like the sound of a typewriter !, sometimes I bring back a friend with me at night so we can have a talk or I can take him out to dinner with my wife,  Words: 264
