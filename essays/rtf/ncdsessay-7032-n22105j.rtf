My name is [female name] [surname]. I was married 2 years ago in London I am now living with my husband on a farm called Burrance of Courance in Scotland My husband who is the farmer owns about 1000 sheep and 100 cows. My job is to feed the 3 sheep dogs and our 24 hens as well as various other things. I have a son of 2 called [male name] after his father.
Today has been a busy day when I woke up this morning [male name] (my husband my son I will call [male name]) was off up in the top hill field rounding up the bullocks to be taken away in the lorry to market in DUmfriess. Just after I discovered this [male name] appeared in my bedroom with one of my books which he wanted me to read when I had read it to him I realized that the time was 8 o'clock and leapt out of bed and made the breakfast. After that I fed the hens and the dogs and [male name]. Just then [male name] came in and asked if [male name] would like to go and see the cows milked while I went into Town. Andy thought he would so I went to town in peace. In Dumfriess I bought the usual things as well as a very nice pair of blue dungeree's for [male name]. I also bought a pair of very long wellingtons for [male name] which he wanted for dipping. Then I went home and cooked the lunch. In the afternoon I brushed the dogs and I must of felt very brave because I began to springclean the kitchen that evening I was very tired and went to bed quite early.  Words: 291
