I am 25 years old the life I'm leading is dress making. Ive got my own buisness and a housewife as well. I have a full hour job and when I get home I have dinner to cook. I get home at 5 oclock and my Husband hets home at 6 oclock so I have an hour to do it in. In my spare time I would get some scraps out and make some toys for the spastics out of felt. In one night I could make 100 felt toys to pass my time away. I make my own dresses to put in the shop and sell them at xxxx5 then I would make xxxx3 profit. Because the cotton cost about 2s and the material xxxx1-0s-0d so I make xxxx3-10s-0d profit. So If I went bank rupt I could still make some more dresses to sell. When It's a childrens holiday and I'm working I take the children with me so I know were they are. Ive made the children a lot of toys instead of buying them. But they could easy pull the stuffing out of them if its not sown up firm. I soon shall have to stop making dresses for my self because the shops running short and my machines running out. My intrests are reading books If I have some spare time I read books. One night a theif broke in and I went bank rupt.  Words: 240
