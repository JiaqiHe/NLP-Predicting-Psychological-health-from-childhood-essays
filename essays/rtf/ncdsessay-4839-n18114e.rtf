I have just come out of college a year ago and now have a job with [company] ([company]) and I am working the computers there. In my spare time I go to the bandroom in [village] for a practice with the senior band After the band practice I go home to teach some boys who want to play a certain instrument and introduce them into the junior band.
      I have a wife and one eleven year old son who is starting to learn about electronics and has already made a two-way telephone to use when he is using up his spare time. 
      On my holidays from work I take my son fishing to a well known salmon and trout water. He enjoys it as much as I do and has made his own electric scooter for taking himself to fishing spots in the country.
      My wife and I go out on a Saturday while our son  goes to his friends with some of his electronic equipment.
      I get up for work at eight o'clock in the morning and have a lunch break at twelve o'clock. At one o'clock I start work again and finish at five O'clock in the afternoon, just in time fortea. After work on a Friday I help my son to make more electronic equipment.  Words: 219
