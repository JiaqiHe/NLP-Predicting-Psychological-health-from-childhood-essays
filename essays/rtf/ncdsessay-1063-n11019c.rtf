"I have got a little bungalow just out side [town], and I am married with one child, a little girl and she is called ""[name]"" she is 12 months old. My husband has got a car it is a Ford and sometimes I use it so go to the shops. This is the story of my life at twenty five. I loved dressing [name] ready to go to her Nain's so that I could go to work in the morning. I only had a part time job as a short-hand typest, but I got quite a lot of money and since my husband was working we did quite well. The interests I had were, long holidays with plenty of sun, sewing, my little girls cloths. I remember once we went on holiday to [island] on a boat called the ""[boat]"" and this is what happened. 
      We were going to stay at a hotel in [island] that was on the coast, I remember we had a lovely veiw from our window the sea was a lovely shade of blue with specks of white here and there. We had got a nice cot for [name] who was only seven months at the time. [name] and me had a lovely room with a double bed in the middle of the room I don't know why it was their, easyer for cleaning I sopose. We stayed their for six days and then we boarded the ship for the second time, on the home ward journey. When we arrived home we felt rather hungry so we had a drink of tea and some biscuits."
