I would like to be a footballer and playing for prefsanol football team. I would be marade and I like four children. I would live in a nice house wich was large. I would like to own a boutiqe and a football shop. I would have a large garden I'd have a dog, cat goldfish rabbit and be a manager of a farm. In my back garden I would have a football pitch for children to play on. My house would look old fashion. And the things inside would be old looking My front garden would have four little bushes in the corners with flowers in a circle. I would half of the money I earn a week to charity.  Words: 120
