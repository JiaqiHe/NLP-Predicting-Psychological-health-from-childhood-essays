I am going to go out and anjoy* myself. And will look after myself and if my mum every took ill, I would go and look after her. I will go to dances with my firends and go to dinners to. And sometimes set* my hair up. And somtimes I will go to some* clubes. I would like to be an hair dresser and set hairs. When I am not doing anythink I put some of my pop songs on. And I wil lask my firend for tea. When I go out to dances I will make my self up. I would like to have a bungalow with a big garden with trees in it to. I would like to go Wales for my holiday and go swimming in the sea. And I will send post cards to all my firends and ****. And sometimes go on bike rides. And I make dress for my self. I will like to go round London and buy shoes and coats.  Words: 168
