My home is happy one I am* in Africa with the Africans. When I am by myself my interst is gardening and reading my life I'm leading I like very much teaching Native at a Native school. Sometimes I help the Native women bath their children and help them dress them. I sometimes help the English doctors in the hospital there are alot of nuns some of them are vey nice but others just do their work and say they have no time to talk. Most of them talk while their doing their work. Some of the native women come to them for help and they stop talking and go straight away to see what's the matter. Sometimes the Native women don't come to the nuns for help because the is some sort of trouble they come to them to ask if they will help them with thie children. Nuns are very good at calming babys and the bigger children. I watch one once calming a boy he was furious but she calmed him as quick as you can say Jack Robinson. It's not very often anyone saw that. Nuns are very kind people and we should be thankful.  Words: 199
