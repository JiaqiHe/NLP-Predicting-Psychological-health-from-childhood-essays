When I am 25 I want to breed big dogs like Great Danes or Dobermann, to live in a big country house in Gloucesteshire. Besides kennels at the back of the house I would like stables for four showjumpers as I would like to be able to go in for jumping events. I hope I would get enough money to run all this by writing books about horses and dogs. I don't want any children at all, partly because I don't like babies.  Words: 83
