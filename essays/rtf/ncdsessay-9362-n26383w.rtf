I would like to be a fireman because it is a dangerous job because you have to restque people. You wear heavy clothes and have a heavy helmet on and i would like to be a driver because all the vercals would have to move over to the side of the road. They have on the fire engine lots of choppers and gallons and gallons of water ojn board the fire-engine. The ladders are about eighty foot high. The engine go about ninty miles an hour and fire-engines can hold about ten gallon of petrol. The fire men have to have six olevels to qually fie as a fire-men. You would have to get up about three o'clock in the morning till about ten o'clock at night. If you save people in hotel's they put your picture in the papers, or in other places. You dont see much of your home its mostly firers you see. If firers are so bad that it needs gas masks lots of people die. It is'ent only fires its flats or house carlapcing. Then fireman have to dig out the people or animals.  Words: 189
