At the age of 25 I hope to be starting teaching as a profesion and in spare time going to town and get the things nessesary then brouse round bouticques* for more modern outfits as I intend to keep up to date. I may be engaged or even married but as I would have just started my teaching I hope I wont have a family till I have taught for quite some time. I hope my boy friend wont mind pop music and I hope he is modern too and will dance to pop music with me and go to coffie bars. I by then am married I want a split level house called weeping willows and is surrounded but not shaded by weeping willows and if my husband is fairly well off I hope to have a swimming pool. The furniture will be realy up to date with thoes twist chairs and glass modern art tables. As a teacher I dont intend being too strict and caining children I will be the same as my teacher is now not always tanding* out and as I like P E I will give exiting things to my pupils to do and enjoy like I do.
