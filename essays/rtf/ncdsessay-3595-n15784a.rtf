When I am 25 years old I would help my mother and father a lot. I would like to be a chef. I would dig the garden for my father and do some of the cooking for my mother. I would like to get married, and have two children of my own. I like to play football with my friends. I would like a dog and to keep pigeons. May be I can get a big house and room to have a garden and a greenhouse. I might go bird watching. In order to pay my rents I would get a fair amount of money. I would try to pay all my bills. I would keep money in year* the bank. I like physical exercises and playing outdoor games. I would like my chidren both to go to grammer school. I would see thay they both did homework. I would keep all my family healthy, and fit. Sometimes I might win some money racing my pigeons. On the money I would try to get a bigger and better pigeons loft. I wouldn't drink so often that I made my self ill. I would never get drunk. Living at the age of 25 years old will be very nice. This is the addres I would like to live at,   [name] [address].   I would like to have a party when I am 21 years old. I my spare time I would like to read. I hope my children will be good singers as I am.  Words: 253
