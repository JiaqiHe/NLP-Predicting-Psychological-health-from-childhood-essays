I was 25 three weeks ago and I live in a bungalow on a hill, just up the hill there is a riding school and a farm. The farmer is a friend of mine and we go fishing together. My job is an electronic engineer in a computer department working on planes, I sometimes go abroad if computers for planes have double.
When I go fishing with my friend me farmer, we often go out in my boat about a mile out to sea and nearly always catch *** and herring. On spring I start planting like, potatoes, cabbages, peas and various vegetables. I have a greenhouse and an allotment on which I grow flowers etc. In my spare time I make wooden models and gardening chairs in my work shop in my back garden. I make jig-saws and paint pictures. Sometimes I go to watch wrestling and play darts at the local public house ***** I sometimes help at the bar, One September there was a fire at (place) airport and a fire engine had a crash when running to the fire. One fireman was injured and the rest were all OK.
Every year I go on holiday with the public house darts club. We go to Wales, Scotland and Cornwall, and sometimes to the Channel Islands. The club has won the charity cup three times and the union cup once. I visited a new museum last week and seen how diamonds were cut in the olden days and how ice cream was made. There were some stocks and a pillory there.  Words: 261
