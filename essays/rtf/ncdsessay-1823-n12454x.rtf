"I hope to get a good job. When I am 26 I will get married.
I will then adopt a child and stop work I shall have a pedigree German dog which I shall call (name) I shall go out every Saturday to a club. When I am about 30 I shall learn to drive and have a Spitfire car in red and black, when my child is 16 she will come out with me, I shall live a happy life.
I hope when I""m about 70 I shall die in peace and my daugter shall have my things."  Words: 97
