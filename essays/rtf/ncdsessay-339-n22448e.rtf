I think when I am 21 I would like to have some sort of Job in Commercial art. desighning poster's or anything to do with drawing or sketching. I would like to have a house with a laarge garden so I chould build the out-door railway i'v all-ways been dreaming about. I think it would be a modern house, but not too modern or it would look flash. I like dawing and designing thing's but not doing one thing for too long or I would get bored. If I could not get this kind of Job I think my second choice would be with car's but I'm not sure what kind of Job it would be. When I got home of a night I would like Just to press a button and in a flash a hot meal would come sliding down a shute into my hands, then I would switch on the t.v., have a read and my night would be complete. My chief hobbie would be the garden railway I mentioned before and my second hobbie would be collecting things like relic's of the past (mostly railway thing's) and putting them on show. I would like to have an iteresting life and not the same thing day after day. I think with this life I would be happy but you can't tell realy. By then I might have some sort of mini jet to get to work in and I think this would stop traffic's jam's and I think robot's of some kind would be doing thing's like controlling air-craft from hele-platform's or lifting heavy load's I might even have one to clean the house!.
