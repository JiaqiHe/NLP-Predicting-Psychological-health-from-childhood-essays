When I grow up I think that I would go to [xxxxxxx] to my Auntie's and Work with horses. I think I would get married when I was 21. I would go and Visit my Mother and Father and my sisters If they were'nt a broad I would probably have some Livery Stables of my Own. My cousin [xxxxxxx] Who lives with my Auntie would come and work with me. I think I would have some hunters and a few ponies for my children I would expect that I would go on working with horses for along time. And after working with horses I don't know what I'd do I might be an ordanary housewife or own a racehorse or even have a riding school of my own Our I might go about buying and selling horses with my cousin. But after all the hardworking with horses I think Id try and get another Job just as good worthwhile and Id try not to retire. I think Id get a nice little house in [xxxxxxx] in [xxxxxxx]. with a little pond at the bottom of the garden. Then I would go abroad on a holiday to France or [xxxxxxx] and come back again I would try not to waste my living years and I don't like getting old quickly. By the time I was forty I would know what Id do Id probably go back to horses And I probaly would go to my Mothers and Fathers to live. And my husband Would come to with my children.  Words: 258
