I would like to be a typist and live somewere in the country. And when I have spare time at work I would do some dress making. Sometimes I would go for a walk in the country. And go to pictures and night times some times I would read or watch my favorite televison programes. And when I go to bed I would sit up for an hour or so reading the paper or reading a book in bed. If I had a garden I would probably do some gardining in my spare time. I might make up books or poetry in my spare time but only sometimes.When my husband is at work I would go and vist some friends who live near me. or go and see my mother and father who live near me. If I have a baby I would probably take it visiting to see its nan or aunt. When I got married I would be married in a church and be dressed in white and have about four bridesmaids.  Words: 174
