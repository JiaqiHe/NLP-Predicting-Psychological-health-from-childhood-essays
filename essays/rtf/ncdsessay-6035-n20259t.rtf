I was going out with my friend called [female name] to a dance, I still had my curlers in my hair and alot of other things to do, the dance started at 7 o'clock and [female name] was coming for me at 6.30 and I had to be ready to go for that time however I was soon ready and Carol came for me.
After the dance when I got home I went straigh to my bed, it was very late so nobody was up, in the morning my mother wakend me up with the radio at full blast right in my ear but it was also the only way that could get me up. I gulped down my breakfast as fast as I could a got dressed. I dashed of to work and at long last I was sitting in my chair at an office sticking stamps on letters, after a days hard work I got my pay.
When I was coming home there was a terrible accidnet a bus had banged into a moter car and the car went on fire.
A man phoned for an ambulance but did not phone for the fire and police and so I did I did not wait for praise as I was to meet [female name] at the dance hall to go home.  Words: 219
