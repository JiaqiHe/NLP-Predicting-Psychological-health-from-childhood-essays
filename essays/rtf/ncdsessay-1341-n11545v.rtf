I am now a nurse woking in a childrens ward in a London Hospital. I am very happy at my job and try to do it a well as I can. Every night I do a lot of studying at home. Everybody at the hospital is kind to me. In the morning I have to get up at seven o'clock and drive to where I keep my car near the Hospital, then I go round the children's wards checking that all the children are alright, then report back to sister. My mother has been in hospital for a long time and she told me that the food in hospitals was horrible, but it has improved alot since she was in hear. Now some of the children look forward to having their tonsels out and to have ice cream and jelly. 
     I have been on night duties five times but I would rather be on day duty because it is a happier time and more noisey three times I have seen an oparation and they were all sucsessful.  Words: 178
