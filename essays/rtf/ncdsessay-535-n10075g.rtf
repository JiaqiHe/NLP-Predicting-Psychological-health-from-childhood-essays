I would like be marride and have one or two children of course I would have to stay at home to look after my husband and cook his dinner and look after the children till they went to school and then I would get a job because I would not after have to care for my children then I would get a bit more more money to buy my children some clothes and my-self some too. I will go to dances at night time. I would go c climbing and camping to Blackpool we would go by bus because we have no got a car to go in but if we had a car my husband and I and the children would go my car. My children would play on the yard if it was my fine they would nolplay on the yard if it was raining they would play in the house. If it was my childrens birthday I would let them have a party they would have about seven or eight children. I woud decorate the Christmas tree with lights and trimings I would like in a to live in house. I would like my husband to be king to the children but not make my children spoilt.  Words: 210
