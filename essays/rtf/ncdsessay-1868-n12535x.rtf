I am now 25 years old I am leading a very happy life my home interests are washing clothes, knitting, sewing. I am married and have four children and I am a school teacher. I enjoy being a teacher because I know I am helping young peoples education. I am happy being a teacher, I work at the same school as my children and we arrive home at the same time. also when they get holidays I would not worry about what they were doing because I would also be on holiday . If any of my children came into the class I was teaching I would be just as fair with them as with other children. I would not pick one girl out of the class as she would be called the teacher pet , I would give every one a change to go messagges for me . I would not use a belt when it was needed . I would give them regular lessons and maybe if they were good I would give them Gym at middle of week and painting on Friday .  
I would be fair and only put work on the wall if it was good not because I like the girl .
My hobbies are tennis , swimming , dancing , and shoting in my spare time I do some of these things I wish to lead a **** and very good life .  Words: 239
