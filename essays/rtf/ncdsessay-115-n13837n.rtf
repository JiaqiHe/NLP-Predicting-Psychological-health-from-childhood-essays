I set of on a Monday morning in a car to go to a Registrey office to get married, it was 9 oclock in the morning and I got there at half past nine I had butterflys when I walked into the office. My boyfriend was waiting for me by the table next to a man. When he put the Ring on I felt so happy I wanted to cry. When it was over I went with my husband and most of my relations and my mother, father and brother to a very big hall in the town. We had to eat sandwiches, fruit and wedding cake and some other nice food. We had Shampane, bear, tomato Juice and some soft drinks for the people who didn't like bear. It was about four o'clock when the party had finished and when I wented off in my Husbands car to live in a flat my mother was in tears.  Words: 158
