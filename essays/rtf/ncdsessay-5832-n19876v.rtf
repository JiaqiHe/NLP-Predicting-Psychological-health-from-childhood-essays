I am 25 years old and I work as a secretary in a big department store. At 8.30 pm. I set out for work. I have half an hour to get to work for I must be in the office at 9 o'clock.
I do typing and shorthand while I am at work. Lunch break is at 11am when I have coffee and biscuits. At one o'clock I go home for dinner then go back to work and stay there until 5.30 pm. At night I sometimes go out or go swimming but not always as I like to read. My hobbies are swimming, dancing and table-tennis. Each friday night my friend comes down and on tuesday I go to her house. I live in a bungalow which is just outside classes. My dogs name is patch he is a yorkshire terrier. When I go to the swimming baths I stay in two sessions.
On Wednesday I play table-tennis from 7.0 p.m to 8.30 pm at the table-tennis class. I am very happy with my work and enjoy the kind of life I lead.  Words: 182
