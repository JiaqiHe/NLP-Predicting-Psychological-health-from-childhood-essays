It is very nice at my New work as a shop kepper. Next year I am hoping that I get married and have about three or four children. I am getting on fine at my new work. Uesly* when I come home I make my self a cup of cocoa. When I have finished my cups of cocoa. there is not much sugar left or milk. So I have to hurry and go down the shop and get some more before my mum and dad come home I had to get down the shop in fifteen minutes so I realy had to hurry I realy don't no if I want that many children I would rather have five or six. Of course when I went and the shop I never walked you see I liked because if I did I would have had to walk or run very quickly. Even then I had to bike like mad anyway that was in my dinner hour So when I finely got in my shop I saw about seventy seven people coming towards me for some sweets I shoud say that they have been bean nicking.
