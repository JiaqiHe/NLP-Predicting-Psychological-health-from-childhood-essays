"Today I am 25 years old, on the aircraft carrier Ark Royal the C.O. has just made me a Phantom fighter pilot as well a a helicopter pilot I have been a 'choper' (helicoper) pilot for a year and a half. I had just come from training about the Phantoms, when the claxton went, then we heard a terrific bang and the whole ship rocked then the commander's voice came over the loud speaker he said ""Port engines out of action, Phantom pilot and crew take off to fight it out and good luck"". Then there was a burst of gunfire and a Phantom bloew up. The blast damaged another and two men were flung into the water I dashed to my plane and jumped into the cockpit, a man closed the canopy I said to the navigator ready he said ""Roger."" I guned the engine then there was a jerk and we were catapulted into the air. Then there was an enemy in the sight I slamed my thumb down on the firing button and the plane spirald down and blew up in the sea, then the plane shuddered then we started* to go down we both pulled the ejection and ejected, there was a lurch and the parachute opened and I drifted down and landed in the sea. My life jacket inflated and I was afloat, I must have droped of to sleep. About 2 hours later I heard the blades of a helicopter, then I felt myself lifted into the copter and next I was in the ships hospital and I said to myself what a birthday."  Words: 270
