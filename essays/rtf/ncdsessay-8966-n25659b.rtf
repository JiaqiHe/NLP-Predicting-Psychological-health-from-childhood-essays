I am working in a garage as a motor mechanic. It is a hard job but I have got used to it. I am able to go home every night and it is a six days per week. I am interested in the engines and not the chassis. It is a hard life but I find it very interesting to hear all the storys about men who's engines have broken down and things like that Every Sunday if it was warm I would go down to the sea and have a rest from all the rush of the town. If I ever hear of any coin exibitions I would go as that is one of my favorite hobbys. My garage is situated on a main road and we do a lot of bussness there as people want petrol for the car. My home is down a quiet road out in the country.  Words: 152
