My house is in New Zealand and and I am work for an arketect. My job is to make modles of the houses and bridges that the arketect* designs. Some of the modles are easy to make but sometimes I have to make modles of brigdes which can be very hard. When I get home at night I have my tea and then talk to my children and wife. 
     In the morning I have to get up at 7.00 In time to get my breakfast to be of for work for 7.45. When I get to work. I start with geting out the tools I use them I get started on the modles I am going to make.
Mr Allen comes in at 8.00 to start work at 12.00 we have dinner. The dinner hour is 1 1/2 hours so I pack up and go for dinner. I have my dinner and then a 1.15 I start out for work again. 
At 5.00 I go home. When I get home I like to draw the flowers and trees in the garden.
     At weekends and holidays I like to go cicleing* with the children we usually go where it is quiet and there is no main road to bother about somtimes I take my sketch book with me and I draw the land and trees.
When we do not go drawing we go for picnics* *** to see freinds that is how the weeks go by.  Words: 244
