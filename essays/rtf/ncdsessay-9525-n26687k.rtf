I am now twenty five years old. I live in a small house outside [town]. I work as a policeman and every day I have too patrol the streets, direct the traffic, and do all the normal stuff. I also work for [charity], and I go around collecting. In my spare time I go to watch [football club] play. When [football club] are not playing I sit down and watch the television. My hobbies are stamp collecting, coin collecting, and playing the piano. when I get the chance I go to Holland, to which I went when I was a boy of eleven. That time I went with the school, but now I go on my own but still to the same hotel. when you enter my sitting room the first thing you will see is a collection of school photograhs.  Words: 141
