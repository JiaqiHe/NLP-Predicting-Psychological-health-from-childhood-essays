I am leading a very busy life and I am married. I work with horses, and I do not live at home. I have a flat over the horses in the stable yard. I get up at 5o'clock sometimes in the morning and go down to the stables and groom all the horses before exercising them, I ride over commons. Then when we are home I feed the horses and a lorry may come with hay. I do have some help. My interests are looking over horses, riding them, I love swimming and sailing in yatchs. My home life is very ordanary I see my sister and my mother and fatehr who live abroad. My brothers who are married and they live abroad. I fly to Cosico which is stting on the top of Africa on the map and visit my youngest brother who is 31 years old. Today I am going to see my sister who is marred and is 24 years old with three children. Her husband is a doctor. My youngest brother is an Architect and has a patnership with a man who lives in England. Next week I am going to spend a week with my grandmother who was born in 1873 and is now selebrating her Centenary and the whole family will be there.
