When I get married and I am 25 I want to have two children first a boy then a girl so when the boy gets older he shall put up for his little sister. I want to work in a shop not a big shop like the maypole and co-op just a small shop. In my house I will want sental heating, eltict blankets for our beds, pink roses on the wall paper in the my bed room, a nice big pram for the childrem. I would like to live in a house with three bed rooms I would want silding doors in betine the front room and back room. A frig in the kitchen a washing machine, a ironing board a iron. I would like a two peace sety a side board a dressing table and walldob and a silver tea pot and cups with pink roses on and sauce pans to cook with. When the children grow up to about 7 years old I will get them a two wheelar bike and the boy a car to ride in and doll which giggles for the girl. I would like cupboards to put things in. I would like my little girl to have long curly hair.  Words: 207
