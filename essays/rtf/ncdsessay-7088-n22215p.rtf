When I am 25 I will be at work I hope. I want to be a farmer and be a tractor drever. And to look after pigs. When I have save up some money I will get a feild and buy some pigs. I will breed them and when I have 12 more pigs I will sell there baby's to a butcher. In my spear time I will go fish and sell what I catch to a fishman so I will get some money to buy a pony or a caravan. I will have one corner to put the coravan in  And I will buy a car if I have the money. If I have a hoilday and I have xxxx50 I will go abroad and have my hoiday. If I get sacked I will be a bus driver and drive a a double becka bus. And I will not have long holiday as if I would have as a farmers 25 is not a young number saw I will not know so much. When I have got what I want I may buy a spead boot. And go crusing I rivers and on the sea. I might get marride. I do not now. That is when I am 25.  Words: 210
