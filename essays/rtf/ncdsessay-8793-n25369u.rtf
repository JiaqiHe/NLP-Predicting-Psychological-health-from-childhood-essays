I would like to marry a normal person not a rich person or poor. When I Start work I would like to lurn how to drive a car. If I owned a car I would like a sports car or a mini. If I married a man he would have to stay at work, and must not be lazy. He must not object to everything I say. He must be able to decorate and lift furniture about. If I had a boy I would like to call him [name], And If I had a girl I would call her [name].  Words: 142
