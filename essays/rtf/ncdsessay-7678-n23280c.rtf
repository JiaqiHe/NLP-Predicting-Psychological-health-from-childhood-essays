I am now 25 yrs old and I am working on my Fathers farm for I love animals and Farm work on the Farm I plough the feilds and help with two kinds of harvesting corn & sugarbeet. In summer I hoe the weekds from between the sugarbeet and spray it I do hoeing by hand and spraying with the tractor.
When the straw from the corn has been baled up I stack them into piles of six.
At about 3 oclock each day I have to go in and help milk the cows 
We finish milking the cows at about 6 oclock after that very often my Father and I go and repair the machinery or change something and put something better in its place for the job we are doing we do this until about 8pm
Some days I help my Mother in the house with cooking dusting and generally tidying up. sometimes in the week I go out riding with my Mother Father or a friend of mine.
Each morning I usually get up at about 6 am When I am working on the farm
for just after six we have to milk the cows again.  Words: 194
