When I am 25 I would like to be a swimming baths attendant. I would like to live in the country but not far from a town. I would buy a car probably a Zepher or a Jaguar and take my family to somewhere [illegible fiche] for a holiday each year if I could afford it If I left the swimming baths I would like to be a policeman or a fireman. I think I would enjoy these jobs because they are active.  Words: 83
