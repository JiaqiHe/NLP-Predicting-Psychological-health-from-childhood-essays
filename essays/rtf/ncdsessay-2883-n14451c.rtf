I am now 25 years old, Married With two children. My Husband is an electrician so he doesn't get a bad wage. I live in a detached house, With a front and back garden. Before I was married I was a short-hand Typist in a Bank. Any time I have spare time or go out in afternoons I take interest in what I see and do. At night when all the children are in bed and my husband is back from work we watch television, listen to the wireless or get some one to baby-sit (a relation) so that we can go to the cinema. When we go on our holidays we go to a place where we'll all enjoy ourselves, like Butlins, Denmark and London. When my little girl who is six goes to school I see that she is smartly dressed and is clean and tidy. Sometimes on a Saturday we go to my husbands club for at least 2 hours so that the baby-sitter won't be kept up very late. When all my children had both started school I would try and get in the Gilbert and Sulliven as an ameteur as I had always Wanted to be an actress. My husband at some-times he would go and have a game of football with his friends. If my husband came in quite early I would go out on every Wednesday to my girls-night. At home I would see that the house was dusted and hoovered, the washing done, and ironed, the beds made, and the cooking done. When any-one came I would make them see that they were welcome.
