I would go to work every day, and I would perphaps own a mother car to take me works in. Sometimes I would go to London for two weeks and own a flat, I am dress maker and when I get back I will dig in new dresses. I would go pictures with my friend dawn sometimes. and we would go Bradgate park and take our tea, we would go in my car. and I would go in town with dawn. Sometimes I would sit down and think about school. I might get married but I might not but I would probley keep single. I would go sometimes to Nottingham for three weeks. and ice skat, and sometimes I would go swimming.  Words: 122
