"When I am 25 I hope I have a good job, I would like to make self propelled boats and aeroplanes x I am 2* and I have a good job I am in the army in the tank corps. I am not married and I haven't any children . I hope I don't get married . In my spare time I build self-propelled boat and aircraft just for fun . My interests are in collect-ing small army veichles of all kinds . I will still collect stamps and have a large collection when I am in the army I shall stay on for about 12 years, so when I leave that job I shall be 37 year old. On leave I shall visit home and stay there until I am called back from my leave . if there is a war on and I am called in I probally get killed in a tank when one of the enemy blew it up I wouldn't care twopence if I died If I get out of the army alive I will be a electronic in the air force . When I get my pay I will sent presents to my mother and father. I my training I was not very good but I made it and I am one of a tank crew I am the driver. Every day when i get up out of my bunk I feel quite fit and I always want to do some exercises . At night I usually am sad that I have to sleep . I would rather stay on guard duty all night . When it comes to have marowers with the tank I am almost to happy to go. Most of the time I get into trouble with the observer by doing the wrong thing and going of course. I am sometimes fed up of the man in charge of thes tank division . I like all the others shops in our divieion except the observer of our tank red the Sargeant Major . I like (name) the best , he sits be side me in the gunners position he is always makes jokes and he speaks corkay . (name) has nicknamed the observer , "" (name) the observer"" and the sur-geant Major ""(name) Major "" because when he stands near a puddle we drive the tank right through it and he gets all muddy. He nicknamed the tank to . Its nickname was "" (name)""."  Words: 414
