I like the work and in the morning I make the beds. The best work I like doing is washing the pots. I like working but I get tired sometimes. I sometimes go out in the garden to do some gardening. I go Shopping on a Wednesday to get the grocers. Then I make my dinner and after dinner I go out for a walk. On Thursday morning I Clean the windows if it is fine. I hoover up every day and I hoover up stairs on a friday morning. At night time I read the Paper before I go to bed. On Monday morning I make our breakfast. And I clean up then I have a drink at 10 o.clock. After I have the drink I put the dinner on. A bout 12 o.clock I set the table for my dinner. then* in the afternoon I have a rest. I like ironing. I iron on a Tuesday.  Words: 158
