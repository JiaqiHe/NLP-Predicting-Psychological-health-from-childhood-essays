My job is a vet  And day exept on Sunday I have a clinic. It starts from 8pm to 6 pm I have an ambition to go to Africa and help the wild animals. But I am not nearly proffesional enough to go there yet I am married have one child who is nearly 1 year old. Every day i have to know exactly what annestecic is what so i do not give a say blind cat a jag for a dog with a brocken leg. In my job I get new accedemees every day and sometimes the animal does not get better. I also have a lot of casses where I do not know what is wrong. In my private life I help my son try to swim and walk When he is older I shall help him do sports so he can be an athletic. In my spare time I go to play s and sometimes we go to the pictures. My wife is a typist in the hospital. My wife thinks I should join the prison service like my dad is in but I think my job is one of the very best . it was not up to 3 months ago that I realy wanted to be a vet. I was thinking of play ing football for (team). I hope to be at this job for years to come and I hope my son shall proberly follow my footsteps If he does he may even be better at it than I am  Words: 256
