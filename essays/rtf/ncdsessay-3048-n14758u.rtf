[Date] I am just joining the w.a.f. for 2 years. In two years when I am out of the w.a.f. I am hoping to be engadge for 2 months and get married. I might be engagde for a wile longer but however long it dosen't matter. My Interest in tennise is very Good and I have also won a G.c.e. for needle work. When I am out of the w.a.f. and have Setled down I am  hoping to get a job in [company], dressing the modles in the shop window, and serving on the stalls, but how ever if I can't get a job in [name] I shall have to look else where. By the time I am 30 I hope that I have settled down with one child Of corse before I get married I would look for a flat, and by the time I am 35 I should have a house but if I haven't I shall have to keep looking for a house with room for two adults and a child. If I am wise and I don't get married I should stay on to colledge and learn to teach before I get married. Then when I am teaching In a School for about 6 or 7 years then I will get married. however if I don't get to be a teacher I shall have to go back to shop jobs and that, or if I am not a teacher I might be a nurse and fix peoples heads and arms and legs soon be a matron, and some of my reletives just might tern out to be a nurse or a teacher like me. I could evan be a bus conductress and Sell all the ticets to the people. I could let the inspector see all of the ticets, but there is always a possibility that I don't go to colledge.  Words: 315
