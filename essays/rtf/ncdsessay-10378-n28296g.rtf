I am now 25 years old and I joined the army four yeas aga. After going though gruling training and behaving myself I have reached the rank of Lutenant and I comand a task forse.
At home my interests are on my spare leave time helping my mother in any way I posably can. I like fixing things for my mother like if the garage roof needs re-cresatting I do that and if there is a rod to be done in the loft I am always willing to oblige in any way. My mother has a cat which when I come home on leave always cringes away from me but next instant it comes round my legg purring for it knows it its good and greets me when I come home I always give it some cholalate drops.
When I go back to the barraks a day before I am suposed to I always go to the gym to slaken up before I go our on an exersize. I vault over the vault and while I'm in the air I do two forward sumersaults. The trampaline is my best form of exercize for I can do vertually anything. I can jump ten feet up and do two forward summersaults land on my knees and get up still bouncing.
When I'm on a combat trainig exercise the best part I like is trying to cross a river with pullies.  Words: 235
