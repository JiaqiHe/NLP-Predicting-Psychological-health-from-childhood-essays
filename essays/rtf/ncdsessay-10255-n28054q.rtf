----------------------
I am married with two lovely little children, a boy and a girl. In the morning I see my children of to school and my husband of to work, then I started to clear away the breakfast things and clear round the house a bit. When this is over I get the dinner on to cook, and then I perhaps do some ironing, washing, or sewing.  Round about 1 o'clock I start getting ready for work until 3 o'clock and I rush of. I work at 1 a place called (company) as a part-time secetary. I enjoy my job, and its suitable timeing for me. I get home cook the tea and tidy up again after my children come home. I wash up and my children help wipe up. Then on Monday nights I get ready for my night school class. i go to cooking class. On Wednesdays its painting class from which I learnt to do a big snow-scene painting which is hung over our fire-place. We have a nice home, nice children and I enjoy my way of life a lot.
