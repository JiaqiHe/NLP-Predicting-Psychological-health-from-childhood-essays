I am a director of a printing firm in [city] called [company].
      When I Look out of my Window I See a Lawn in the middle of a roundabout with flowers and a seat, but What Spoils it is the noise of the Trafic. My secretery is next door to my office She is very help full to me. She brings me Tea at three o'clock.
      When I get home our dog who is a dalmation Jumps up to greet me and my Wife makes me a Cup of tea and a Sandwitch. At about 7 o'clock my Wife and I go to our local pub and then We go to see my mother are father.
      In the Weekend I Take Percy our dog for a walk in the fields, he is one and a half. If it is raining I usually Paint in my Studio. On Sunday we go to Church and my Parents come to lunch and Stay for the day.
      For our Summer holidays We usualy go to cornwall for about two weeks we Stay in a flat about four hundred yards from the Sea. We bring a Sailing boat With us so that we can sail. 
      When I retire I am going to spend the rest of my life Painting.  Words: 215
