I hope to join the merchant nevy and go all over the world to spain, Japan, Australia, and other famous places. I woule like being in storms which would be very exciting helping guide the boat to safty and be in a bay helping with repairs. I would buy foreign* clothes, toys with my wages I get at the end of the month*. If I get married I would buy my wife cloths from abroad and I would like to learn all the forein languges so I would have no difficulty in trying to understand what they are speaking about. On my holidays I would like to explore Scotland in the county and find all fiferent kinds of stone and all sorts of stuff which I see, I would like to climb Ben Nevis with climbing equipment which would be dangerous like lose* stones*, slippery mud and all other dangers. When I am older I would like to be captain of a ship and learn all the things you have to know about a ship. I would learn to drive a car so I would not have to get atrain to Helensburhg* pier because thats where some* of the merchant navy ships put anchor to see if any damage has been done.  Words: 212
