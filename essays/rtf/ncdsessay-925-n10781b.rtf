I am married and have two children name Sally and Christopher. I have a full time job as a teacher of Domestic science. I have many interests including collecting anything of interest, knitting, needlework, reading is a great interest of mine, I also like sport such as tennis and rounders, and another interest of mine is dress making for my daughter. My home life is most relaxing, as I live near beautiful countryside and s**mery, but I do not see my home very often because i do not arrive home from my work until at least 9p.m. some nights and other times it is about 7p.m. I have a wonderful life and everything I want without being spoilt. Both my children attend the county Grammar school and their ages are 11 and 12 Chrisopher is the eldest at 12.  Words: 139
