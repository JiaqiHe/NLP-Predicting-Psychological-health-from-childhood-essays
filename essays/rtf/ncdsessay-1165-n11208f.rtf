My job is a mecanic at the [company] car works. I have to set out at six o'clock to get there in time. When I arrive I change into my work clothes. Then I start working by fixing the engine together. Sometimes I have to fix cars which have gone wrong. After dinner I have to test the cars which are ready to go on the road. When I arrive home, my wife has nice hot dinner ready for me. After this we discuse things that we have heard of and about articals we have read in the paper that night. When the children are in bed we talk about moving and about emagrating. At the weekends we go out to the seaside or to the country in our car. The children like this and most of all the oldest one.
