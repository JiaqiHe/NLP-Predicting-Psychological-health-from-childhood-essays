----------------------
I am a teacher in an infants school. I teach chilldren from the age of 5 years to 6 years. I enjoy my job a lot because the chilldren are nice and so are the rest of the staff. (I only came here 4 weeks ago) I have a husband who works at a factory. I live driving about in our car and I also like to cook. I don't get very much time to do the house work in the week because of the school work, but it is fun having a mad dash round the house in the morning to see if everythings tidy and then rushing off to school. My husband and I are very interested in fossil hunting and whenever we can we put on an old pair of jeans and a jumper and get the car out and go to the cotswolds to see if we can find anything. At the weekends sometimes, we go out to shows. When we do we always go in gardening tent. My husband is mad on it!  Words: 178
