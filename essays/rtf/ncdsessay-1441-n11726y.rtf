I am twenty-five my intrests are reading and making up plays, stories and poems. I am a* teacher at a technical high school and I take english and history. I find it very intresting and enjoyable. I find that I have no spare time because it is all taken up in marking books, preparing for the next lesson, studiing and my intrests like swimming and sports. I have an Austin 1800 which runs very smoothly and is a reliable car only when it has an oil leak. I have a wise and a baby son. I live in a nice big house in the country near a little village. I am very pleased with my work and I go swimming twice a week I also go on a training course.  Words: 130
