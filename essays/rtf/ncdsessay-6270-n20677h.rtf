When I am 25 I would like to be an actress on stage and play musical instruments. If this does not happen I will be a school teacher and teach music. With the money I earn I will buy pop records. I would not like to write books. If I get married I would like to have 3 children, 2 girls and a boy the girls I will call [female name] and the other one [female name] the boy I will [male name]. In the house I will do the cooking and all the other work I will visit my parents and brothers and sisters once every week and that will be on a Sunday. My interests is music. I hope I will be a teacher teaching music.  Words: 128
