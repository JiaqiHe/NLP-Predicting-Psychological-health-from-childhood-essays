My life.
I am living in Herefordshire in a village called [village]. It is eight miles away from [town].
I am working as an english teacehr in a school called [school name]. I am going to work there for six years then I am going to write some books about prehistoric animals.
I also have some hobbies, for instance stamp collecting. I would like to become an expert. I have got four thousand, eight hundred and seventy two stamps. 
I have already had a book printed about photography as I am very keen it. I have a German camera which cost xxxx15.
At home I have four pets. I have a Labrador dog who's name is Juno. Kiki is the parrot. She is very sweet. She can say quite alot of things. My cats called Romeo and Julliet. I don't know why but one is a boy and one is a girl so we thought that Romeo and Julliet would be a sensible name.
I enjoy my life very much.  Words: 165
