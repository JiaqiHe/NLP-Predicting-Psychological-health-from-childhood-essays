But before she had mended my trouses she jumped on the bed and started messing around with me. But then she went brung me my trouses and I went to work that day I was taken ill at work and they sent me home but I died before I reached home. 3 day's later my funeral was prepared and I went buried in a coffin, they lowered the coffin in to the grave and that was it what was what I was buried.
