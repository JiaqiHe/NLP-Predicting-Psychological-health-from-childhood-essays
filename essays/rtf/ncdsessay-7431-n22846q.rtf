I am 25 years old and I live in a little cottage with my husband. We have just moved in and the cottage does not look very nice at all. There are boxes all over the place and the furniture man have just driven away in his van. My husband **** had got a job before we were married in a big furn* in **** and were quite well off. While he was away at work I had to clean the cottage up because my mother and father were coming the following night, and I did not know where* to start*. At about six a clock that night I had finish the cottage. and everywhere looked spotless. I was very (good) pleased with myself. Just as I was strating* the curtains* a car drove up the drive. (and) the car was a lovey blue (coul) colure, and it was ****'s car. He he hid from his work. We have a good life together and (we) (have) two children (+i)* one is a girl called Jane. and a boy called Peter. My Mother loves* Jane and so do everyone who meets her. Peter is sometimes jedase* when Jane is getting the most atenshan but we love him too.  Words: 207
