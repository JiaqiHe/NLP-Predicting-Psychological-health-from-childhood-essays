At 25 I am stationed at R.A.F [airfield]. As a pilot I do quite a lot of flying and training. I am married, with 2 children a girl and a boy, the girl is 3 years old and the boy four. Every night as I come home to number [house number] [street name] there is always a hot dinner for me cooked by my wife. At the weekend (I have weekend off duty) I like to take my wife and kids out on a picnic somewhere, mostly on the moor or as far away as [city] to have a look at the peaks. On Sunday I lay in bed for a few more hours and have my breakfast in bed. Through Sunday I usually go too the poultry farm nearby and buy a chicken for our dinner. After, I help tidy up and then sit down and read the papers. On the Sunday night we tuck the children into bed and go out for a drink or a meal, at the nearby Restaurant. On the Monday morning I pack my lunch and put it in the car after the goodbye's, I drive down to the Airfield about 10 mile away. To my surprise I was promoted to wing commander in charge of a whole wing of aircraft. That night my wife and I celebrated to my promotion. My wife went to work on Tuesday and Thursday on a spare time job. She earnt a few pounds for herself. On these day's the children were sent to the Nursery. So live went on through the normal routine, apart from a few changes.  Words: 271
