I live in a flat in [village] with my husband and two daughters. One is two and the other four the both have jet black hair bright blue eyes and their names are [name] and [name] they play with each other a lot. In our flat there are three bedrooms one is pink, one is yellow and the other is a spare room and is a mixture of colours. There is also a dining room which has a gold wallpaper and the floor has wooden tiles layed in a herringbone pattern. The kitchen is a clean blue colour and it has a fridge, an electric cooker, lots of cupboard space three working tops, a stainless steel topped sink and every thing else which I need. My husband goes to work at 8 o'clock comes back at 7 o'clock and has supper. Then on thursday nights I go out to evening classes which start at half past seven and on monday night I go to cooking classes at quater past seven. At eleven o'clock both daughters go to nursery school while I do my shopping.  Words: 184
