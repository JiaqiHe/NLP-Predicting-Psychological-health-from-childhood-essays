When I am at the age of 25 I hope to be sill studying at collage or university. The thing I would like to do, as a job, is to be a vet. To be a vet you need to study a long time but I don't think I would mind. It is a very skilful job because there must be hundreds of different animals, birds sea-water creatures. If I get this job I will have very little time for hobbies, such as stamp collecting and bird watching. I will probaly live on the premisis of the surjary because of the time you have to start, working the things you have to get, and the things you have to do, after all is it a lot easyer than having to travel in a morning to work and at night to go home when yo just have to nip round the back or up stairs.
Juring my spair time as well as doing hobbies I will work on the house and garden. Being a vet I will propaly have pets my-self which will be another of my pastimes.
I will work for my-self and not for another man which should make life a little easer.  Words: 202
