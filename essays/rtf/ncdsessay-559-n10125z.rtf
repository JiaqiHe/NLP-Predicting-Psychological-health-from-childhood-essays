I would  get married when i am about twenty five. My husband would work while i can be bringing up the children, when they are old enough to go to School I think that i would have a job in a place like [company], where they send off clothes and cataloges. I would like to have a bigger house than I have now, but ferther away into the country. If I get alot of money I would go and live abroad, may be in Austria Somewhere in the sun. I might learn lots of langueges and visit different countries, which I would like to do. I would most proberly have Some pets may be a dog, if I did have a dog it would be a Bull Terrier.
