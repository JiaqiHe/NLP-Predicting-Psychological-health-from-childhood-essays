----------------------
I am now 25 years old, and I am a Vet. I live with my parents, and my two brothers. I don't often go out, in the evening and every week I go to a riding stable, where I ride.
I start work at 9 A.M. It takes me about half an hour to walk, so I leave my house about 8.15 am. Mostly it is dogs and cats, that have been run over by cars. In Early Spring or late Summer, I have to look after young birds while they're moulting. I finish work at 6.30 pm. and then go out to riding stables, and places like that to see animals.
That takes about 2 hours. The latest I ever get home is 9.30 pm
Wednesday and SUnday I get off, (another Vet takes my place). On Sunday I go out with my friends. And on Wednesday I help at home. 
[male name] my brother is still at University, [male name] my other brother is working in London, and comes home about once a month. [male name] is is Dublin University, and he enjoys it very much.
I like my job very much and I don't want to do anything else but cureing animals.  Words: 201
