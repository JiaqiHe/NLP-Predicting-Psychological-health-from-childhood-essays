I am 25 five years old, and play goal keeper for Leeds Utd. I very really have eny spare time as most of it is taken up by training, in the bit of spare time I do get I go home have a good rest, then go out with the rest of the team for a few drinks. If there is a dart board in the club then I would have a few games. I very raerly have more than 3 drinks as I am somtimes sick. I have a pet dog which I take nearly every where with me, it comes to the grounds and is looked after by the cleaner as he is very fond of it. My house hardly ever gets untidy as I am never in for it to do so. I eat most of my meals at a cafe near the ground, my meals consist of a large steak, patatoes peas carrotts gravey and caulyflower, I also have a drink of tea. I am not married as I would not see my wife as much as I would have wanted and it would have been pritty boaring for her. I never get board as I can never find time to board. My house isnt rented its my own and has been so since I was 21. In my house I have a three peace sweet a table a radio gram which hardly ever gets played, two other chairs and a television. Saturdays are my most busy days, I get up in a morning get dressed call a taxi to take me to the ground. When I arive I have something to eat put a bit more dubbin on my boots do some training and then have a rest before the game.  Words: 296
