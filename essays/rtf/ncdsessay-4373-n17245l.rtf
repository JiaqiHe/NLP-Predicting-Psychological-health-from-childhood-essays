I am a nurse and I like it very much. When I have spare time of I often read and write letters to people I know. In my bedroom I have stickers of people which are famous and I am a fan of. My interests are going to clubs in the evening and I like doing needlework. I work in teh childrens ward and you have to be very patient with them. I sometimes make some coffee and go to bed to read. I like my job a lot and I am going to keep on at it as long as I can.  Words: 103
