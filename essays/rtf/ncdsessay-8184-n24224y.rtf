if i was twenty five i would like a stable with about eighteen horses or ponies. My bungalow would be across the road with a fish pond a rabbit hutch with a rabbit a summer house with a few hamsters and a parrot. My bungalow would have two bedrooms a kitchen, a front-room and a bathroom. Every day i would get up at seven feed and clean out my hamsters rabbit and parrot about eight 'o' clock see to the ponies and horses. at nine 'o' clock. the people would come if they wanted there lesson, they would be out for one hour wich at the moment costs ten shillings. at half past ten i would clean out the stables and clean the ****. then i would put my dinner on while that was on i would feed the horses and ponies, then have my dinner. after that i would do the house work. about three 'o' clock put the horses and ponies graze as well as the rabbit and hamsters. at five 'o' clock put them back again have my tea do the gardening. At seven 'o' clock clear up and watch telly or do some sewing until ten 'o' clock have my supper, wash up and go to bed at half past ten. Some of the week days i would go shopping or to horse shows.
