When I get older I'll probily go to work in a shop of some kind. I have alway's wanted to go and live in America and see how they work if I have children I hope they will be girls and have plenty of fun. The things I would do in America will mainly be travelling into other parts by plane. When we have settled down I'll start to go to work and send my children to school. Later on I might take them over to England for them to see how I lived when I was a child and if they like it they could spend holiday's there and visit st Paul's Cathidral and the musieums. If I get bored in America I might go back* to England and visit my friend's and parents. I will make most of my children's clothes and make them whooly dolls and teddy bear's. Most of the time I spend will be at home with my children and keeping the house clean and tidy, when they can look after themselves I will open a hairdressers and earn some money to buy food and some clothes with. Sometimes I will go out dancing with my husband and get a lady to look after the children. and send them to bed of a night.  Words: 219
