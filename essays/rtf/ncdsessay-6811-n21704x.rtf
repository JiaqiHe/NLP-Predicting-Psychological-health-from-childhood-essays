My name is Miss [female name] [female name] [surname]. I am twenty five years of age. I am in College taking my A Levels to be a vet. If I do not pass I will either work in the kennels or own a pet shop. I have not much spare time for we have a lot of work to do. 
I get on with my Tooters here and it will be sad to leave. I remember when I was eleven years of age I have five gold fish, one rabbit and a cat. I would of liked a dog but but we were a big family so I could not have one. I will be taking my A levels next year.
If I have a chance to have some spare time I will go to the country into the woods to see all the wild animals. Although I like animals I till think it crule to keep animlas in a zoo. How would you like it in a cage like that?
