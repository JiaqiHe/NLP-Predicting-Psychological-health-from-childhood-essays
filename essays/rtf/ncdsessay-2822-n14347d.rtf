"I have just moved into a flat with a flat mate. We work together in a large Co-op store. My friends name is [name] and she is 26 years old, our address is [address]. I work on the clothes stall and my friend works on the children's toy stall. At night I come from work at 5 o clock. and have my tea. The flat consits of two bedrooms, one living room, a sitting room and a kitchen. After tea I get ready to go out to a dance which finishes at 11 o'clock, then I go to a cafe with [name] to get our supper and then go home* and go to bed. Next morning I start work at 8 o'clock and as it is Wednesday it is my half day. I came home at 1 o'clock and went to the ice rink at 2. This time I went not with [name] but [name] who lives next door to us. We had a great time and came home at 6 o'clock. After tea I settled down to my book ""The Man In The River"". At 8 o'clock I changed my hobby and got out my sewing. I was making my self a dress to go to the dance with I was also making a jumper. The following evening I went to the fair with [name] and I won lots of thing and money. That night I had some soup and I went to sleep warm and snug in my bed."  Words: 251
