I am twenty five and I am married to a dancer like myself. We have got a nice bungalow and a dog. I am expecting my Second baby in March and I will have to give up my carrer but I have enough money in the bank. My first baby is a girl and I hope my second one is too. My family is a happy one. My home life is very tiring but you soon get used to it after your first baby. My eldest baby is three and she makes my time tiring a little. We have a big garden my husband is thritey. My spear time is spent on making clothes for the baby. I do all the house work and the decarating. My youngest child goes to a nesery school so I have a quiet day all day.  Words: 142
