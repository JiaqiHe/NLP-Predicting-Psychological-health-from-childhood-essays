I have a good job as an engineer and live on the outskirts of the town. I own a large house and equipment for astronomy which is my favourite hobby. I have a camera, cine-camera, projector, flash-gun and other equipment for use in photography. I have two dogs. Sheba which is a white boxer, and Ben which is a Red setter. I also have a collection of butterflys. In my garden I have large ponds which contain fish. I have a parrot called and two cockatoos. My parents live with me and also my brother lives five minutes walk from the house. My employer owns a wind-mill which I am allowed to visit when I please. My land consists of two and a half acres of which one acre is long grass. Counting the garden and paths and ponds and ouch I have one acre of ground which is not grass, which leaves an area of half an acre of lawn.  Words: 161
