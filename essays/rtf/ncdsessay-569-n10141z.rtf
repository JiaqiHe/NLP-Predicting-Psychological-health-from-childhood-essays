Every day at seven o clock I get up for work . On a Saturday and Sunday i only work to noon , but every other day i work to five oclock. My occupation is an engineer . I usually go out at nights with my wife, whilst my mother baby-sits for our child, (name) 2 years old . Every Saturday after work I go to the football match. After that i come home and have my tea. When my wife and I go out we usually go to the pictures or we go to a friend of ours house for a couple of hours. Some-times on a Sunday afternoon we all have a walk in the park. On a Sunday night we sit and watch television to about 11pm . In the mornings when the alarm - clock rings my wife and I get up. My wife makes me my breakfast. When i go to work my wife cleans up the house . At noon I come home and have my dinner then I go back to work .  Words: 180
