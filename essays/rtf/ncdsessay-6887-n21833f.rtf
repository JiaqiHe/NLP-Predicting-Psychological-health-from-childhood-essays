I am * now twenty five years old, and I am a computer programer. The world has changed in fourteen years. For instance, the only old type of buses we have are in transport musuems. We now travel in mono-trains which go underground. Houses now have there own electricty generators instored, which runs by battery. I work at the N.C.S. (Northern Computer Station) in Carlisle. It is one of the most modern computer stations in the world, ands also has some of the most latest  and complicated machinery. (in the world.) My job is to feed information into the computer, programme it and uncode the results. I have also to wipe the computers memory cells in case information is jumbled. The security is strict and it is impossible to get out if by the memotest chance you managed to get in. We have many computers hear but the best is the A.N.R.I. (American Nuclear Rockets Information) a computer just for the Americans. So that is what 1983 is like.  Words: 169
