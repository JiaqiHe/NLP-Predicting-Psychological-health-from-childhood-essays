When I am 25 I would start my life by getting married having a home and a job. My home would have a garden back and front so my children could play on the back garden when it is nice I would get a job of typist or nurse or other things. If I would be a nurse we would start early in the morning looking after pationts and all other things. If I could'nt get a job * when I leave school I would go to the employment office because they can get a job easy instead of your self looking for a job. I would have children and look after them giving them baby food, and giving the things they want while they are little, and I would learn them swim while they are young so when they grow up they can swim because if they  fell in a river they could swim out but if they can't swim they would drown. I would like my children be a nurse or a docter so when they have children and they hurt them selves the mother can do it or small acciden like taking a dog awalk on the lead and if he saw a dog he would run towards him and the one who's taking it a walk will trip and fall so the mother can look after it. If I had a boy I would like him to be electric or a painter and decorater because they can paper the rooms and paint the doors and the scertan boards and all other things I would let my children get married and have children them selves.
