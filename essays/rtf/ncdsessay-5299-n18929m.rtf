"I am nurse [name] of [hospital]. And I do all Sorts of work. looking after children is a tuff job because some of them won't stay in bed when my back is turned they hop out of bed, and Ifind them difficult to cope with. I like looking after babies. I think i'ts interesting work. Sometimes I take patients to the gardens or if the want the roof garden. When the children feel fed up I give them ajig saw or some to do. Nurses life I find is very interesting although you might not get much it's a worth while Job. When Sometimes an elderly person Is feeling lonely Igo to talk to them tell them a story or sing a song with them. But when your in hospital you find you have a nice time. not like some people say. Some people find that they would pefure to go to a home for rest. 
      in my spare time I like to go to the park and bring acouple of books to read. when I have the morning off I like to vist old people and get any shopping for them. when I have finished quite early in the eving I get my room tidy I have got a room mate we often go out to gether.
