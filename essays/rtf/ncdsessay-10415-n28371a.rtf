----------------------
I live in a small, old country cottage. It has 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, a dining room, a sitting room and a kitchen. I have got a garden of about 3/* of an awe*. There is a kennel outside for my 2 labradors. I have got a land rover. Every other morning I go to my vets. S**gery at ****. On the others I am either free or visting farms. 
     I had got my vetinary decree six months ago. In the winter when I am free *** weekends I often go shooting for pleasants and pa*bridges with some friends ** ** organised shoot* or just stroll around by myself shooting vermin. I would take my dogs. 
     When I am not doing this I would be whipping in for the North Essess foot seagles. In the summer I would wither help exercise the hounds, or retire peacefully to my sailing dingy*, am enterprise. In my holiday I would go and work on a farm if it was harvest time. I might even go birdwatching in Scotland or to the Shetland Isles. Or otherwise stay with my mother or father. 
     My 2 labradors would retrieve birds. They both loved my gun. They are brothers.  Words: 205
