I started off by going in for trials for Mancester City, gradualy I began to get better, then my big moment came I got picket to play for the first team. I lead a very good life and a happy one, I like smiming and ruby, Football annd all kinds of sports. I go training every day besides sunday. At the age of 16 I didnt know which to take up rugby or Football or rugby I asked my fathers advice and he said, try to find which you were the best at, I stooded this and finally I thought I might be a bit to little to play rugby so I take up soccer. Mostly I am itrested is sports there is not one sport I dont like but I am not all that keen on horse racing, but every year every one of my family but a few shillings on the grand natinal.
