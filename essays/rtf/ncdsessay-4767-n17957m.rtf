At home I am interested in doing all the work, then I have to pick up odds and end then I go up stairs and do all the work upstairs. Then I go of to work, I work at a packing clothes in a shop, I leave my house at about nine in the morning and I don't leave work till four a clock, then I go straight to pick up my two children from school, then have to rush home and put the dinner on because my husband has to go back to work. When it is about eight when the children are in bed, I sit down or go out. I come in about ten then my husband comes in at eleven then he want's something to eat. After I have done all that when there is nothing to do, I get tomorrows things ready for the children to wear then I do a little bit of washing then I go to bed about one oclock. Then I get up at six and get my husband up then I go back to bed for half an hour then the day starts again.  Words: 194
