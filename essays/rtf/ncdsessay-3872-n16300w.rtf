When I am 25 years old I would like to be a shopkeep. I often go in to shops and I thing sometime what a lovely shop. I would like to be the maniger of this lovely shop, because I would get every day lots of money and I would not keep it all to myself but give some to my parents and any other friends. I would also make my costermors feel at home so that they would think what a lovely shop I would like to come here every day and so I would get extra money, but I would not like to cheet them, so I would be very careful to be extra kind to them. I would like to have a sweet shop and lots of other things like, vegetabals, newspapars, cloths, icescream, toys, and planty other things, it would be like six shops all in one I won't take over all the time I would like some friends of my to take over half of the time or I would like my relertives I think it would be better if my relertives would take over. It realy would be fun speacly for my bothers children if they are married and they have children, they could play with my toy I would like to give some of the toys free for them and we would go on picnics with some sweets, icecream, it would be fun, but I am not shure if I could be a shop keeper but I would like it very much.
