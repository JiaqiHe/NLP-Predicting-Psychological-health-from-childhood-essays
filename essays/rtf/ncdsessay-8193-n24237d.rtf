I am working in a Zoo . The Zoo keeper is nice and I like him. My home is in (place) and I am living on my own. I read a lot of animal books,I like all sorts of animals, birds, and fish. My life is a happy one and I like it very much . I would eventually like to be an expert Zooligist. I would often go and visit my parents . Later I would go and live somewhere else I would like all animals to understand that mankind is not going to harm it.I think it is cruel to hunt animals, fish , and kill them. It is all right if it is for food but it is cruel hunting for sport. The animals were put on the earth first so they have just as much right to be here as we do .I would like it to have everything on earth to be happy.  Words: 158
