I am a hairdresser I work nearly every morning from 9 o'clock till 7 o'clock in the night on a saturday it would be half day. and my staff would have the day off. On the Sunday I would come down to clean up a bit ready for the morning. Sometimes I would have some custurmes on a sunday becauce they would be going out some where. and they would like there hair done before the went out. My hobbies would be to play the drums evry saturday night if I was free. My home is nice I have two girls and one boy. My two girls are well bo*r* up. One is called [name] and the other is called [name]. the boys name is [name] he is not all that bright* but he helps alot at home. I find my life a bit hard in* places but I enjoy it alot.
