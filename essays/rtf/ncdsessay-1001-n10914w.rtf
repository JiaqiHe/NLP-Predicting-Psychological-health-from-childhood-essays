Now I am 25 I am leading a very intresting life. I am married and I work at the **** Collage. In *he wood work department. At home my hobby is collecting stamps. The car that I have is a Jaguar. We have a very big garden which is mostly grass but some of it is flowers and the rest where I plant seeds for some food. It is a hobby. I take my wife out about once a week. And we go to dances. When I am on holiday I go to see my sisters. One is 23 and the other 27 we also go and see my wifes farther and mother mostly working for five days a week. Another hobby is golf. I go to church on sunday. And I help with what goes on like jumble sales and so on. We dont live in a house but we live in a bungalow. We have a colour T.V. we are very friendly with our next door neibour who has three children. But they keep pinching our plum* or our trees. I wont let my wife go to work. I hop to have a girl and a boy. I think I lead a very nice life.  Words: 207
