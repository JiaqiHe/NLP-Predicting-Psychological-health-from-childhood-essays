When I am twenty five I would by a car and I would like to buy a house and I would most probly have some pets like a dog I would get marryed and go out at the week ends to the sea and I would like to play football for a team near where I lived and I would most probly go fishing at the sea. I dont know what kind of job I would get but I will most brebly get one. I would go out to shows and the pictures with other people and I would take my family for a ride in the car sometimes. In the week I would go to work and when i come home I would have my tea and watch television and at the weekend I would play football and on sunday I would just stay at home or go out somewhere, for pleasure.
