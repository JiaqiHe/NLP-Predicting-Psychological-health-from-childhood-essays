I was on my way to work I now work in a store I started about two weeks ago and I injoy it very much for I have nice pay and we have right amount of people each day. My interests are driveing, shooting and breeding dogs. My first hobby is shooting my next is driving and third of breeding dogs which olng* do it with my freind in breeding time. My home is in [village] and in the [area?] part I am not married, but I am hopeing to as so as possible in [village] there is not much to do. You can go the [village]* Youth Center which is nice now and again by ether from that there is nothing to do. When I am older I hope to get a job in Plymouth in Lawsons or Boots or somewhere interesting. On Friday I work a whole day from 9am to 6pm. On hot day we get more people than a few on cold day I said we had the right amoung of peope in the store when I said that I ment 40 to 50 people on hot days 70 to 80 people which means I am quite busy serving sweet, fruit and things like that. I am glad when we are closed and I get my pay and go home for a rest in the morning feel much better and and a fresh day I feel better for the next day get 10s an hour so I get xxxx3 10s a aday and the 10s on friday. And on Saturday and Sunday I have a holiday.  Words: 270
