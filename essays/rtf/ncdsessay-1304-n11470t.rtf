----------------------
I finished my studies to become a vet 2 years ago, I have a 7 day week working. I am married and we have a bungalow of our own, my husband is a doctor with black hair and glasses, he is middle - **ed . Even though I work severn days a week. I still find time to ride or swim in the evenings. Our bungalow is fairly out in the country, but we have a car, so we get around all right, our bungulow is white and looks rather plain from the outside, but you would be surprised if you saw inside it. even though I say it myself it is rather pretty. I finish my work at five o'clock every everning, or rather, I`m suposed to. I am often held up by a late call. My average time for arriving home is 5.45. I then ocupy myself with swimming, riding, or perhaps a little sowing. untill my husband gets home at about 7 o'clock, if it is an easy meal, we have tea at about 7.30, but if it is complicated, we eat between 8 o`clock and 8 30. We follow this routene almost every day except Saturday, when, if we are lucky and there is a good film on, we go to the cinema. We both get up at six o`clock every morning, he leaves at 8 and I leave a 8.30 . I have a lunch - break of an hour 12 o`clock to 1 o` clock  Words: 251
