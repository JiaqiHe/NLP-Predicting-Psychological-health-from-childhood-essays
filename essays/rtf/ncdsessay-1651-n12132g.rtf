Now I am 25 years old I am married with children of my own. I have a part time job. I am interested in the animals that I have. My home life is very pleasant and acceptable. My job first of all is a shorthand typist and I enjoy it and like it very much indeed. My animals are a dog a cat and I also have a guinea pig. The life I am leading is a good pleasant one and I enjoy it very much. I have no worried and I am in good health. I am now going to tell you about my home life. I live out in the country on a building esate in a new house. My home life seems to have faded away now that I am older and married but my interests have still kept going and I shall tell of them. I am particularly interested in tennis and still interested in painting though not as much as I used to be. I have many friends some of them are friendsi had at school but there are still very faithful. They say if I am faithful to them then they shall be faithful to me. Which i think is a good thing.
