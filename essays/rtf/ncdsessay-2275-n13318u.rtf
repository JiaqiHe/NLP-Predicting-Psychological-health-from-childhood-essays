When I am 25 I am going to be a bus conductor and I can go on the green buses. When I get paid I can go into a public. Sometimes my mom takes me down if dad isn't going and she gives me a drink of her beer. If keep on being paid and I can get a car. And then I can get married then when I have been married I can to places anywhere I want.  Words: 79
