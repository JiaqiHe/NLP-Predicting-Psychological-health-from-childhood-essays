I am 25 years old and I am going on to 26 at about 25 years old you should be married. and when you are married you have to do the house work, and look after the children. and you have to go into town and do all the shoping and feed my husband and feed my children and myself and then clear up after the meal and put the children to bed and then sit down and have a bit of peace waching T.V. and some times I may go and see my mother and father or even my aunt or uncle or I may even go out with the children for the day. and when the children are old enough to go to school I would send them to school and then I chould do my shoping in peace and then go and collect them at 4 o'clock and take them home for their tea. when you are at the age of 25 you can look back when I was a little child playing in the park. in the morning when the children and me and my husband has had our breakfast and the children have gone to school I go up stairs and make the bed and do all the house work and then it is time for me to get the children for dinner.
