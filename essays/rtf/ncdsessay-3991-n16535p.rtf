I am 25 years old I o and go to London University. I live in a small country house near the river Thames, where My Father owns six large colourful speed boats in which he lets me ride on the river with. I am learning to be a School teacher and am hoping to pass the tests in which I have to sit. My interests are Swimming, flying Model Planes made mysELf and my main interest is boating but with having to go to university. I do not have much time do do these things. At the moment I am sitting my exams, but I hope to be leaving* University next year so I may have a bit extra time to do these things. A few months ago I bougth a small sports car which helps me to get to University easier and much quicker. During the summer we get a months holiday this enables me to go abroad for a holiday and there I can get a bit of peace and quiet.  Words: 173
