I would play football for a football club called NEWCASTLE UNITED, in my spare time I would practise football or I would go to the cinema. I have three children called [name], [name] and [name] every time I play football they come and support* me. When I am at home I play with my children in the garden, [name] is the oldest and he keeps pigeons [name] says he want's a dog but his mam does not like them. When I play away I stay in a hotel they are very good and expensive but the manager of the team pay's, when go back home I always have a present for each of my children. The night before I have a match I have to build up my muscles by doing a lot of exercises. Our team is second in the league and we have one match to play before we can get the cup.  Words: 155
