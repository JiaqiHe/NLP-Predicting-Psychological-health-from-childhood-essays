I would like to go to dances and probly go for a holiday by the Sea even evening classes. I would like to work as dress maker. The work I do at home is not bad, I don't do much cleaning Not only a dress maker all other things like a headmistress or a nerse even a vet. I could even go down to the pub with a friend. I could have a party Theres lots of places to shop like [road] or markets in [road] [road] there's things like collecting Stamps Shells coloured Stones I could even get ashtray Shells. I could be a green grocer or work in [company] as a cashier. And I could get xxxx10 wages. I could buy shoes coats Jumpers Stockings I could go Strawberry picking I'd go to my Sisters for a week or more. There's lots of things you could do round there or you could just stay at home and read books or sit infrouht of the fire. But I am getting older So I might as well Stay in bed but a knock* must come some day.  Words: 187
