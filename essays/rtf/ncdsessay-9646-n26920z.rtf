It's Tuesday my day out with my girlfriend * we got engaged two months ago. I sometimes go out on saturday with her. I had just bough a second-hand m** from a dealer in ****. 
     I still play table tennis and I am a member of the **** table tennis club. I also play football in my spare time, I am what they call keep fit maniacs but I believe the fitter you keep the longer yo will live. 
     I work as a accountant and am paid highly for it I needed six o-levels of which I needed one English and one maths. I work a six day week from 7 to 5.
     At home I read books. I play football on sunday .afternoons. I go to church every sunday. I don't watch telivision much now.  Words: 138
