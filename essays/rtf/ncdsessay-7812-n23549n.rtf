I am a vet an I am looking after animans all day. I have two dogs A Terrier called Timmy and a Jack Russel Terrier called Tiger. I finish work at 7 o'clock and Then I take tiger and tummy out for a walk and have my tea. I am married and every saturday morning I do the shopping. I take tiger and timmy with me. But tiger pulls on his lead and barks at everything. SO next week I shall only take timmy because he doesn't bark very much I often do gardening in the garden. And the tulips are just starting to flower. There was a lot of frost in the winter and it killed all the snowdrops. I have a nice house with 3 bedrooms, a kitchen, A dining room, a sitting room and a bath room. I like reading books. I often have to go to peoples houses to see their animals  Words: 156
