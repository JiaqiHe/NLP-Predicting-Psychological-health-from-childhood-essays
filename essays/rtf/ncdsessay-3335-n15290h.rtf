"I'm not married and I don't suppose I will be seeing as I'm traveling all the time. I work for [shipping company] Line on board ship my Mother and Father have work here and my Mothers Father worked for [shipping company] Line. It is a very interesting job for I meet many different people and go to many different places and I have colected forigen dolls from nearly all over the world 
In my spear time that is when I am not at work I do a lot of art and dancing of any kind.
I have a small cottage just out side Southamton (where the docks are) which I try to keep very tidy the trouble is my garden needs digging over about once a week and I can't stand worm so on the weekends I bribe my boyfriend in to coming over to dig it up. He has be my boyfriend for five (5) years now but it is hopeless getting married because I wouldn't be there I suppose I could get a job on board ship for him but he said he do'snt want a job on a ship besides he say's ""I get sea sick."" I didn't beleive him so we tried it I got him a place as a passenger on the Northern Star and we went for a short cruise of corse he was'nt sea sick and I knew it. After the cruise I got him a job on board Northern star and we had a weeks honeymoon in cadiz."  Words: 255
