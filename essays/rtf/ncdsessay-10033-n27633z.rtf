Now I am 25 I am married and have two children. I am interested in gardening golf football and most other sports. I am a keen stamp collector and I read books a lot. I go to dances with my wife quite a lot. I am a school teacher and I teach at a big secondary school I teach games, P.E. and history sometimes.

I attend a course for teachers of P.E. and games.
