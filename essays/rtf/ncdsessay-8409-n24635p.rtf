If I were 25 years old now, I would get a usfull job somewhere like a mechanical engere in the army or navy, beacuuse, I like to do
      I would leave home at 20 or a bit early than that.
      If I never get a job in the army or navy I'd go to [city] to get a job but train at collage somewhere.
      The better the job the better the money and I would give some money to my dad and mom each week. If I get fed up with the job I'm doing I'd try to find another job but. I'd prob'ly stick to the first job I do, I don't know which I would do beacause I'm not 25 years' old yet, I would not like to work in a factory or bakery something like that enyway.  Words: 140
