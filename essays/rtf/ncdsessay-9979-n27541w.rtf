I' am a proffesional footballer I like to go swimming in the summer, on sundays I also like to go shooting for partridge and pheasant and sometimes wild duck. I like to drive fast cars, fly aeroplanes, paint pictures and go for picnics. I also like playing pop records L.Ps and making up jokes, and listening to the radio. I like going on tours or ski-ing holidays when I am not playing football, I like helping the wife in kitchen like makin cakes, jellys etc. and going to weddings or parties.  Words: 91
