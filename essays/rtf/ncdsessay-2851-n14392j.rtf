I live in a small farm with a freind I work there. I train horses and break them in I teach people how to ride and people hire my horses and go for rides usually with me to acompany them so they don't get lost. I also have chickens and ducks and I sell their eggs, I have some cows and pigs. I go out to cinema ocassioanlly and sometimes I go out to dances. When I am not working on the farm I spend my time in the house my freind works on the farm too. When I am in the house I usually read the paper then look in my horsey magazine to see if there are any shows nearby in which I could enter my horse. My home life is very happy my parents don't live very far away so I visit them fairly often and I don't see my sisters and brothers so often. one of my other hobies is swimming so often I collect up my bathing things ride down to the river and have a swim while my horse grazes nearby. Also I help at the local brownies every other Tuesday. I am very happy where I live and would like to stay here always. Sometimes trouble crops up and then everything goes back to normal I lead a very happy life.  Words: 228
