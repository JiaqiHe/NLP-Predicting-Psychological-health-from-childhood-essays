I am married and have one boy whose name is [name]. On Saturdays I play football for [football club]. On Sundays I play cricket for [cricket club]. The shop I own is a sweet shop. During the day my wife looks after the shop with an assisstant while I go to work. My work is haulige work, and I have alot of lorries. Sometimes I wake up at 6 o'clock. in the morning to go to work. I like getting to the yard where my lorries are kept early to organise things, I am always the first there. When I get home it is about 8 o'clock. Sometimes I get home early to take [name] to see a football match.  [name] is only five but he still likes watching football. I take him to see myself play every week. When I am at home I help my wife do the washing up or something else. For a little while I play with [name]. before he goes to bed. The life I lead is very enjoyable but also it is very tiring. and I am glad to go to bed.  Words: 189
