For a job I would like to a secratary, it is an interesting job and you meet a lot of important people who have buisenuis either with your boss or manager or with people in different parts of the building. I would stay and live with my parents until I thought I was able to look after myself, then I would think on getting a flat or even a bungerlo, I have many interests about jobs but first I would go to collage or university and learn about the kind of job a person like me would want to have. It would be interesting to learn about jobs you had never even heard of when you were younger, and to find all about them, a nurses job has never crossed my mind and I dont suppose it ever will, I have always been frightened of doctors and nurses because I always think they are going to give me an injection or even a operation.
