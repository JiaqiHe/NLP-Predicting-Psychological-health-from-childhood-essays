When at the age of 25 I would like to live in a flat down [town] on the 9th Floor. I would like my job to be a builder or a Draughtsman. My intrests will be watching football matches either at [town] or [city]. The reason why I want to be a Draughtsman or a builder beacause you get good money and it is not all that hard. Of a Wednesday most builders get an afternoon off from work on that afternoon I would go and see my Mother and Father. I should like a small Mini car to drive my Mother and Father about and on a Sunday afternoon I will take my Mom and Dad to one of my aunts in the car. I would like to be a single man beacause you don't have your wife pestering you after more money.  Words: 144
