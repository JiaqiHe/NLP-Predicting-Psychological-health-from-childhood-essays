If I was twenty five years old I would be a farmer. I would have a four hundred acars of land and have three men working for me. I would have the modenst tools like a '178 Massy Fergarson' tractor and a 'D.7' bulldoser. I would also have two reversable ploughts. My House would have five bedrooms, two baths, a big kittchen, a dinning room, a office for me to do my paper-work in, a loung and all the other different rooms. The yard would be full of pigs, cows and chickens. I would have a 'Class' combine. which had a 20 foot cut* and three traleors and a 'sixty five' Massy Fergarson tractor. I would have three hundred cows and five fields for them to grase on. There would be three fields for my two hundred pigs, which I would have. I would have a big lane. going to my farm.  Words: 152
