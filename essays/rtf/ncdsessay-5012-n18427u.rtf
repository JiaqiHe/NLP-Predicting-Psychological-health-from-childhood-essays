I wake up in the mourning and have Backen and eggs for Breakfast, then I said goodbye to my wife and get into my car with a mine detector as for I am an ackeologist now. I go to the site now an get it out of the car the mine detector and start to strap it on my back, now I take for of the Brown nith the round shaped object on the end and start walking of over the site suddenly there is a Bleep on the screen and I start digging with my very handy litte trowel, but all I find is a moldy peace of ti*e still I said to myself you cannot be lucky all the time, and went of still working. That evening when I went home my wife came running out to welcome me home she had got my tea ready for me, I ran into the house and Sat down in the arm chair then my wife came in she sat on the side of the armchair and I gave her a lovely big kiss after we had had tea we watched Television together and my wife went out and got some tea ready. Then we both got into bed and* had a *ogish read and then we had an nice long long long sleep.  Words: 223
