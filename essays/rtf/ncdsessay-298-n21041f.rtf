I find it very hard to forget about my younger life. Every day when I wake up, and when I have to get the breakfast I feel that I was only born yesterday. I have only been married about three months and already am expecting a baby. In my spare time I draw and paint, to keep up the practice of drawing that I am begining to lack. My own stories that I write are just to keep in a folder, together with my poems to show, and read my children. Although I do not like needle-work, I go to evening classes, because now, I find it rather useful. Knitting. to me, is a bore. but my mum makes me do it. Ten rows each evening and sometimes ten in the afternoon She has to make me do it. like many other woman lissons that I have to know. The home that we have just bought is big enough for us. Our front garden is half the size of the back. About the middle of May I start to springdean with the help of mum and dad, dad has just been told that in three years time he can retire. Now, I live a very happy, but hectic life.  Words: 209
