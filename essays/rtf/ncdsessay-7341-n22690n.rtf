----------------------
I was just married but I were still carrying on with my job as a nurse in London. My home really was in Wales but I rented a house. When I had any odd days off I went in the Summer to stay with my mother who lived near the beach in a little cottage. In the winter I stayed in London with my husband and kept the house clean and sometimes baby-sitted for neighbours. On longer holidays I went back to Wales and looked after the house and in my spare time I would sew and down things that needed it. Sometimes it was warm enough to go to the beach with my husband. If we had any visitors, like my mother and father who often came they sometimes came with us. At Christmas if I had the day off, my brother and sister came down but sometimes my brother went to mothers and fathers cottage.
I didn't often get manny days off because there had been a car crash and two men killed and a baby seriously hurt, and it was my job to look after her. I enjoyed nursing her as I had always liked my work although sister was rather bossy. I had a friend who usually worked with me in the babies ward. I often looked after new born babies as these were quite a few. The work was rather hard but looking after babies can be rather fun.  Words: 243
