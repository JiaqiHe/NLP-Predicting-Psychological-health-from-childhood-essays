I am a Nany and I look after some peoples children. I live with them and if the people go abroad and would like to take their children with them then I would go as well. My work is to look after the children and to clean up the mess they make, and to make their beds and then take them out for a walk, and play with them. I would have a day off every month so that I could go and see my mother and farther, and I would make the tea for them and clean the house up and make shore that the cat's and dog were feed, and then I would stay for the night and in the morning I would go back to work, but on the way back to work I would visit my brother and his wife at [town]. When I arrived back at work the furst thing I would do is to go up stars and make the beds, then I would dress the children and take them out fore a walk and by the time we came back the dinner would be ready, and after that we would play and go for a nother walk just before we went to bed,  Words: 210
