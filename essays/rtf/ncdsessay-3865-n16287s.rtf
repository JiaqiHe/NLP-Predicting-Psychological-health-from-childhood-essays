When I am 25 years old I would like to be a Pilot or a Footballer. I am very interesting in war films but I would not suit a soldier. I am never going to get married I am going to stay a bachelor. In 14 more years, I think everybody will be working with computers or some other kind of machines. The thing that always comes in to my mind is if there is going to be a World War III or some other things happening. I like watching space things or mystery films. I am going to travel to America to live there and be a pilot there. It is amazing all the things that happen in one day. When I am not working I will build clubs, build myself a house maybe that's if I've got the money. I am sometimes thinking about all the poor people and wish I had enough money to help them. I have caught quite a lot of fish like chub, perch, cod and sometimes if I am lucky trout. Another thing I like is making up poems and storys. But in 1989 I maybe be needed for other things that I jsut wish my wishes come true. Now since I am only young I wonder what it will be like in 14 years from now. I think it will be all gay or maybe the roads will be full with Jauguars, Mercedes, and Rolls Royce's. But now I am sometimes bored with the same things all the time. There is a book. I like reading Treasure Island it is about a pirate named Long John Silver and his parrott.  Words: 278
