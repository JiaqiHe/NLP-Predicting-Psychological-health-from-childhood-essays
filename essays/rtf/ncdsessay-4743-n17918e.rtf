It is 8 o'clock and I have to get up and get my husband's breakfast. When I have got the breafast I go up stairs and get dressed. At nine o'clock I have to go to work ready for my first animal to been seen to. At 12 O'clock I go home and get my lunch. At 2 O'Clock I go back to the surergy and do some more animals.
When the afternoon is over I go back home and take my dog for a walk. When I have taken him for a walk I get the tea readyfor my husband and myself.
At night we usually go out or stay at home. When it is time to go to bed I feel very tired and go to sleep right away.
On Saturdays I go to the stables and have a ride and I usually take some children out on a ride. In the afternoons on Saturday I go to town with my husband and buy the food to last us for a week. My husband some time grumbles when he comes to town with but I just ignore him when he does so.
We never have rows for we think they do no good, so we live a happily married life. On Sundays I go to church and when I come home I do the house work. I like a tidy house so I keep my house as tidy as possible.
Some Sundays I invite my sister and her children to tea, and I also invite my mother and father.  Words: 256
