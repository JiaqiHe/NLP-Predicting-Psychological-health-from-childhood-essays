I am interested in my family my husband and children my children are in a nersery in the mornings. while I go to work from 9 till 1. I am a shop assistant at the co-op. I try to be able to go out at least one night a week and enjoy myself. I am often going in to town to some shopping and I somtimes go and get some material or wool and a pattern to make my family some clothes and especially my little girls dresses. I am interested in knitting and sewing and I often fo this at night when the children are at bed so then they dont keep taking my things. In the mornings I get up quite early and get the breakfast and get ready for work and then I get my sons and daughter's ready and take them to the nersery. When I have taken them I go straight to work. I come home and cook a meal for the evening and we only have soup or somthing for dinner. I am leading a good life and I enjoy my self.  Words: 188
