The first thing I shall do is to get married to a handsome boy. My job I hope will be a kennel maid or a nurse for a mental hospital. I hope to have some children prefraply twins a boy and girl and name them: [female name] and [male name]. The car I have is a sports car so that I can speed down the M1 very fast. Every day I will sweep round the house every morning before I go to work and dust around the house. But if I do get married and have children I will have to give up work for them. I shall enjoy knitting bootees and Matinee coats and little cardigans and trousers for them. And buying cots and prams.
I shall live in America on a ranch near Texas if I don't live in America I shall live in Australia or the Channel Islands, but I shall still have a ranch or stud with horses. I hope I have some other animals or I shall live on a farm. Every morning I shall get up six o'clock and muck out the stable's. I hope to have a lot of money so thay in the summer we could go abroad on holiday.
The pets I shall have will be: dogs three of them, an old English Sheepdog, a collie and alsation.
When I am 25 I hope to celebrate the birthday with a big party with all my friends coming. I should like to teach children of all ages how to nurse or how to look after their pets. If I am a nurse I should like to hold a St. John's Ambulance Brigade in where ever I live. I will enjoy the age of 25 if everything turns out the way I hope.  Words: 297
