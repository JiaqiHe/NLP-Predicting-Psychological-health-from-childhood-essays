I am twenty five years old and my job is an air hostess and I live in ****. I enjoy my job and I like to come home and see house tidy. Why I wanted to get this job is to travel and see different places of the world. When it comes to the Christmas holidays I go to **** to see my family. On the airoplane I meet quite alot of friendly people and we've had no trouble yet. I am not sacered of the plane coliding because I know it only happens once in a blue moon. These are some places I have been africa, Rome, Italy and Sweden. My next plight is to New Zealand and new-york. I live in a flat but I am looking for a house for my self. I want it near the air-port so I don't have far to travel in my mini car.  Words: 152
