I work in a lawyers office it is very busy everday when finished I rush straight home to find my husband feeding the children. Their names are (name) age five and just started school and her twin (name). We live in a four bedroomed bungalow, out side we can see the sands and waves of the river (place). After the children are asleep I walke* down upon the sands in the fresh odour, to smell sea air and be freshend. The next day I am fresh and ready to work the time seems to slow down every day but I am pleased to finish. Some evening I sit down and start knitting jumpers and cardigans for my family, who are very pleased to keep warm in the winter. We all enjoy sea air it keeps us healthy and lively.  Words: 139
