----------------------
I live in the north of England. 
And I play football for a club in my spare time
I work as a engineer.
I would like to come home for my dinners but I can't because I work about 20 miles from home I leave for work at 9 o'clock and I get home at 7, oclock.
I play football for my club on Saturdays. I go swimming with my wife and children on Sunday mornings and I go out in the afternoon, and Some times we go Swimming when I come home from work, W do not in a council house we liwe in a private house, I work in [city] and I don't smoke.
