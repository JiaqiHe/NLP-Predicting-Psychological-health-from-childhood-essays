I work in an office as a secretary. I work in Glasgow. It is a very big building and I enjoy my work. In my spare time I read and sometimes knit or sew. I watch television quite a lot and I listen to the radio. I am married and have two children One is two and the otehr is one. I spend a lot of time looking after my children. I do not have to travel far to my work as I live quite near it. I earn xxxx14 a week. I am kept very busy and I hardly ever have time to read or do anything else although I enjoy it. I sew more than I knit or read as I have my childrens clothes to fix. I enjoy my life very much.  Words: 135
