When I am 25 I will either come a pilot, machanic, or Labrotory assistant, I would like a nice place in the country Nearly every Sunday I would go for a stroll in the country or drive down to the sea if I had a car, I would spend some of my spare time improving the house. If I get to have any son or daughters I would get them to join clubs or if possible get them in the Royal Marines or Cadets. If I can I would try and teach them to swim. I would send them to church or Sunday School every Sunday. I would mostly like to be a Labrotery assistant as then I would buy my son or my daughter a chemistry set. Sometimes I would spend my time studying art as I am very fond on it. I would go and buy myself models which is another one of my hobbies, or even make myself a little toy yaught out of wood like oak or balsar and I would take them to a boating pool and sail them. Our family would also go camping out in the country or go abroad  Words: 197
