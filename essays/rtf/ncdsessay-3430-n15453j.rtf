At the age of 25 I am living in a flat with a friend . I am interested in animals so I am working with a vet and I am hoping to get a surgery of my own soon . I live near my Mother and father so I nearly go to see them every night . I study very hard because there is a lot of work to do . In my spare time I go to see children who have pet's and ask them if they look after them well . When I was a child I always wanted a golden labrador so when I have some money saved up I might buy one . I enjoy my job very much and have liked animals since I was about seven . I often buy newspapers about animals . My favourite animals are dogs . When I am a bit older I would like to go for a holiday to Africa and study the wild animals and birds . As well as liking animals I like insects . I read as much as I can about animals and enjoy seeing animals free not in Zoo's . I think animals should be free in there own countrys and they should not be sport and put in mouseum's . I just sleep in my flat I am out for dinner and go to my mothers and fathers at tea time . I go to a night school to study more about animals . I thing I lead a very busy life with animals and hope to be a very good vet . I start work at 8 oclock but I'm always up early . I have a boy friend but don't see him very much. He thinks I work to hard but I say I never work to hard . I sometimes write storys about animals and try to draw pictures of them . I sometimes go cAmping and get up early to see if I can take some pictures of animals with my camera . I am thinking of writing a paper but dont know yet . This is my life at the age of 25 .
