With a sigh of relief I flopped down on my bed. That party had really been an exausting one and even now I still had the washing up to do. After that I might be able to finish the oil painting but...my feet. I had been giving a new years eve party. and the guests had certaily been lively ones. With an effort I got up and staggered into the kitchen. There I stuffed the washing-up machine full of dirty plates etc. for if there was anything I hated it was washing-up. Then I sat down and started reading. The next day I went down the High street to get some shopping When I had deposited the food at my home I set off to the library. It wasn't a very interesting job being a librarian but it was contributing to my fare for an around the world tour. When I had been about 9 Ihad lived in Australia but when my Mum and Dad decided to go back England it ment that I had been right round the world. Now I was 25 I felt an overwelming desire to see the house where we had lived for four years in Australia. The fare was almost complete but I still needed more money. I bent down absentmindly to hear a little girl complain she couldn't find any Pooh Bear books, A few evenings after the party I went to visit [name] my sister. Her husband, [name] was on the weathy side so besides the pleasure of seeing her I was always pretty sure I could get a good meal, though it really was nice to see her as I was often busy and she lived some way away.
