----------------------
I have just left college and am finding a job. I will probably leave my parents house and be living in my own one. I am now married. My job will depend on what I would like to do, my O and A levels in which I have quite a few. I will probably join a football club, probably the town club.
I would like to live in a village, not in the streets of London of something like that. I would like a home with a large garden as I like gardening. I would like to live somewhere* in Norfolk by the sea. I would like a large car and a boat and baybe a caravan later on, I would like a boat for the reason that I like fishing and a caravan, for camping.
I might want to live in north-Wales By the sea, or in south west of England, but always by the sea, in the country. 
I will not probabably join the Forces, but as my Father was in the army I might join because I know what it* will be like as I can remember when I was nine and Ten years of age what it was like, no, I'll probabably be a busniss man. I will probabably find a job and then* find a house around the distrinct of the job.  Words: 225
