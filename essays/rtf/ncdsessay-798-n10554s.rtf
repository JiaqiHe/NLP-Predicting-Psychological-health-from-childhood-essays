When I am 25 I will have a job as a engineer or macanic. I hope to have a house in the country with a nice garden to dig and plant vegetables. I will own a car (zepher) to go on journeys around England or in Paris. I hope to have a wife and children who I respect. I will have a dog colli*e or a house dog both tame. On weekends I will take my family out for a ride or once a month visit my parents. In the garden I will have some trees (fruit) and a pond with gold fishes in, if it is very big I will have some tame swans as pets. If my thoughts come true and I am rich I will have some maids and a servent. I will give my parents a quarter of my wages and the rest on my wife and the house.
