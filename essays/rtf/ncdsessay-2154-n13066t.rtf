I am now 25 years old and I hope to become anaccountant. In my spare time I am interested in polatice and I like going to dances with my wife. We live in a bungolow in **** and have a caravan for when we go on holiday. We also have a car and go for drives on Sunday afternoons in the country side. In the summer we go on holiday to Spain sometimes, and spend a couple of weeks their in a hotel in Madrid. Last year we had a sking holiday in Switzerland. Our bungalow is on the corner of a busy street and we cannot get to sleep sometimes so we may move to somewhere queiter. Soon I will be taking my exams to become an anaccountant and I may have to work somewhere away from **** so we shall be moving anyway. In my spare time I like to go fishing and gliding at a nearby airbase I am allso a member of a golf club and play golf every sunday morning.  Words: 175
