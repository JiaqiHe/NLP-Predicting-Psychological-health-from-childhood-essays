I would like to be a teacher or a comedian. I should that if I became a teacher I would have a fourth year class. I should like also to be an accountant at somewhere like [company name]. Another thing I should like to do is to be a bank, in any bank. I should save a lot of money so I could travel all over the world. I should also join a tennis club and go there every sunday if I could. In my job as a teacher I suppose there would be some charlies in my class.  Words: 99
