When i am 25 I hope to be a short hand typest for the police and when i come back home about 1 oclock and go about 8o clock in the morning working for the police and lift the mesages fore the police and as the police are serching fore the robbers. they go in and out of the roads and the people who send the messays while they are going round the district. they send the messays along but if they couldn't find the robber they send A serch party out and they surround them and if i couldent be a sort hand typest i would try and be a music teatcher and them to learn them to read music you could type a pice of music and if i watch the telaveision and see if one of my famous pice of music is on the telavison and they are playing music and my typrister is still working i would write more music. because music is one of my hobbies and if noone would play my music my self untill it comes fameus and if it doesn't come famous i know it will come famous later if it doesn't i know it will not be now good so i will ask if they want it but if they don't i will though it away buecuise i wount need it any more.
