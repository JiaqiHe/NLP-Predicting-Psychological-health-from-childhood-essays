when I am twenty-five I hope to be a captin of a ship. (and) to go on all the good ships. I would like to have my distcharge books full. of names of ships. I would have two children a boy and a gerl. My son would take after me and my da**ter after my wife. I would have my own boat. I would like to dive in the sea to get some treasure from the bottom of teh sea. I would be able to fly an earoplane. I would seend three quaters of my money home to my wife. I would look at my famelys fotos every day regular. I would send all kind of animals skins to my wife. they all would be stufed. and cleaned. when I come home I would be full of money. by saving it up. I would put a quater of it in teh back and (the) give my famely half of it and keep the rest for my self. so I would get all my freinds presents. and get sigerets for the cr***. I would (gol) go to every country in the world. I would be able to speek every langu*ige. I would have to be a very vclever man. I would now a lot of giography. I would be *e*pasebut for every man on the ship. I would give all the orders out. If I had to (**eian)* get a (difrent) difrent job I would be a pilot I would not go in the ganinjer* (ear crafte) earoplanes I would go in jets and oches* (guner planes) earoplanes with guns or loms. If I am sight* sick I would not be able to fly in an earoplane so I hope that I will never become sight* sick, I will have big aneversery partys.  Words: 302
