I am now in the army at [village] near [town], my regiment is the R.A.O.C. we store amunition, rockets and missiles our new rocket is the Thunderbird 2. I like my job, sometimes we test the rockets. What intrests me most is when the amunition is brought in and it has to be stored. I have many friends. The meals are good and we have some good cooks. We dont just store amunition we have many hobbies such as - fishing, shooting, sailing, fencing and all sorts of intresting hobbies. One of my friends is learning to be a photographer not an ordinary one as you may well be thinking but a photographer that takes pictures from a helicopter down at buildings and other things. My trade is motor racing, it is a very good trade really, another of my friends took up motor racing and he crashed and is now walking round with his arm in a sling. I am not yet married, I suppose I will get married sometime. I am sometimes board, that is when it's raining and there is nothing to do, but at other times I am really enjoying myself. Swimming is the most popular sport and I do quiet a lot of swimming and I enjoy it very much. we have a swimming bath in our camp I help to put the swimming bath in. I enjoy my life in the army.
