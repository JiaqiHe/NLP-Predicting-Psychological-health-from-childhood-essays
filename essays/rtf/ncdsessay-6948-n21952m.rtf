----------------------
I would try and raise a family with about two children.
If my husband agreed we would by a bungalow in the middle of the country. I hope we would live happily 
I would'not wear mini skirts.
would not put all black eye liner round my eyes.
I would try and work as a part time hairdresser, in the morning I expect I would Shop in Sainsbury's.
I would like to be able to drive to take my children to School in the car and to have a dog and a few horses in case my car broke down. I do not know if I would like to go a different country for my holidays if I did go to another country I think I would go to Spain also I would like to go to Blackpool to see the Lights and to go up the tower for one of my holidays I would like to go to all different places in London. I would like to learn a few langauges aswell.  Words: 168
