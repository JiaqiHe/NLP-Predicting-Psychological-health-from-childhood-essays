The time is 3.15 p.m. and I am an infant teacher at [school name] infant school. I enjoy my work very much and this year I am looking forward to a lovely holiday abroad in Majorca, suddenly a bell rang and a shrill voice called out 'Hometime' at once everyone stood up with a scraping of chairs. We said some prayers and I dismissed the children, I walked down to the teachers common room and found my coat then sighed and said 'Another day over' I ran out to my sportscar and drove home.
I live in a detached house by myself for I am simple, in the next house live my parents. It is a Monday night and thats the night I go to the swimming baths which are near my house. I am an excellent swimmer and can swim 100 lengths of any stroke.
When I come home from the baths I usually have a good tea which my mother makes. Soon bedtime came the time was 11.30 pm
It's getting near the the holidays now just one more day which was chaotic although it was soon over. As soon as I reached home I started packing after that was done I tidied the house from top to bottom.
When morning came I was ready to be off I caught a hoverbus to the aerodrome and caight a jet to where I was going. When I arrived their the sun was blazing down as soon as I left the jet, and their in Majorca I decided to stay and teach for at least twelve months.  Words: 263
