When I am 25 I will find a desent job like a garage man or a shopkeeper, then I will sign a contract first. On a Saturday I would go in the garden and do some gardning. when I have finished I would* go in and do some reeding for about an hour then I would go to town for books and seeds for my garden and some outher things. When I got back I would plant the seeds, then I would go out somewhere and have a good time there. Then on a night I would go for a drink and have a game of darts and I would bring home cups and shields for darts. Then at half-past seven I would get up and have my breakfast and get my things on and get redey for work. then at half-past eight. I would get set of for work. I would cross ofer the road and catch a bus. when I am at work I put my bag down and get to work. When I am getting ready to go home I would get my things and I would go for the bus. then when I got home I take my boots of and coat and read the paper till tea time. After tea I would read if there's nothing on the television for an hour then I would go out to the Club.  Words: 235
