When I am 25 I will be trying to get a job as a amateur footballer. First I will try to go to one of the Luton League clubs and if I still I am not all that experianced I will try to get a job as a full scale referee for the English leagues. If I do start refereeing at the age of 25 I would have 22 years of refereing lying ahead of me and by then I would have hoped to have been in charge of quite a few internationals. Most probably I will have had one of these two jobs but if I should not have these jobs then, with enough experience I could become a club manager. This is the job I would like best but I really doubt if I could get it. When I am twenty five I will have expected a job in some kind of football career. My next job would be working at some big firm in London. I would like it to be a big shop like Barkers in teh West End. Next comes an Airtime pilot but this takes a lot of practising and learning. The plane I would like to pilot would be a Trident 2. They are not to big and not to small and you never seem to heer of one crashing. The next job is a bit far back to do but it is a train driver. I would live (if my futive* wife agrees) in Luton or Norfolk or somewhere about severnty miles from the coast. Really it is hard to say what I will do but what I think I will do is all wrote down in the two pages above.  Words: 289
