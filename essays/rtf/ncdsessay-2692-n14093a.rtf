When I grow up I would like to work in a big shop like [name of shop] in a City. If I got marred I would like four children two boys and two girls. I think I would like to live in a small town just outside a city so it will by not very far to go to work evry day. I would also like a red sports car and a bigger one for us all because a little red sports car would be to small for us all. I would see my children to school and then I would go to work and come back home at six oclock. If I was very rich I would like to go round the word with my children in the school hoidays. If I do not go round the word I would maybe go to Spain for three week. I would also like to take my children to see Lulu and Cilla Black at London onday.  Words: 165
