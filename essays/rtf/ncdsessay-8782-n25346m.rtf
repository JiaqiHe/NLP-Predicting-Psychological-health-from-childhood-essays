I would be an engineer at a garage working full time . As a hobby playing golf or reading books. I am leading a sucsessfull life. I am interested in aeroplanes . rockets and trains. I sometimes go to watch football matches or listen to the wireless. I start work at 9 o clock am . and finish at 6 o ' clock p.m . And an hour for my lunch. I live in a cottage with a garage. Although I do not have a car, Because I travell to work by bus every day.  Words: 95
