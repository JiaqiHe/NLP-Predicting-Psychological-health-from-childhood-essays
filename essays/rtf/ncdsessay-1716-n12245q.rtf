"I am now at the age of twenty five, I have been married for about four years. I am a head of a hospital and I love my work that much I don't think I'll leave it. My husbands name is [name] and I have one daughter her name is [name]. I save money by putting some money away at the bank each week. One day I went to [town] and I saw a lovely mink coat and I said, ""I will go and some money and buy it. So I went home and got some money from the bank. I got twelve guiniese. When I went to the shop the coat was gone I was mad. So I said, ""I'll go and get a lovely holiday for us."  Words: 129
