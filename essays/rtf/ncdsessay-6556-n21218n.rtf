(When I am 25 I enterd to go abroad and learn about other countries. I enterd to study languages.) I am living in my own small flat with a small car. I am studying at collage, to be addventuly able to trane as a pilot. Often I go and visit my parents and we go out to launch and out for walks. In my spare time I go out for a drive or walk into town. Sometimes I stay at home and read or study languges. Sometimes I go out to night club with my friends. When I leave collage I hope to train as a pilot. The aircraft I hope to fly is the Lufthansa VC10. For Lufthansa belongs to B.O.A.C.  Words: 122
