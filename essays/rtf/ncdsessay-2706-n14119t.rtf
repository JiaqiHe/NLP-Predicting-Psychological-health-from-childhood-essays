I am a Shop assistant, I Sell fashion clothes. I like Shop work, helping people chose the dirent* clothes. Mostly teanagers come in, but occasionally the older lady comes in. The houers are resanbal, and the mony is fair. The Shop I work in is called The Clothes Peg, in London. It is neare Lester Square, it's very bizy hear. But the worst of it is when it is hot. And the Shop is Stufy and a lot of pepol are in there.  Words: 83
