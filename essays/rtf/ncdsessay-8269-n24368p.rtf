I am 25 years old and I am married and my husband and I both go out to work. My husband works in the Southern Electricity Board and I am a Secretary in a Headmaster Office, I take the notes round the classes and take other things round and do odd jobs for the Headmaster. I get home after work at 4,o'clock p.m. and my husband gets home at 6,o'clock pm so before he comes home I have time to make his tea. I come home for dinner at 12,o'clock but my husband stay's at work all day from 8,o'clock in the morning until 6,o'clock pm and and I work from 8.30 am until 5pm. I work Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursday's, Friday but never Saturdays or Sundays. In my spare time I knit or go out in the garden.  Words: 139
