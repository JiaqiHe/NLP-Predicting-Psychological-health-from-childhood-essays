----------------------
I am working at the [village] college of technology, as a technician. I enjoy this job very much, there is good pay, and all of the jobs that are set for me are different and I hardly ever get bored. The college is modern, and there are a lot of students who work there. 
I live in a new estate in [suburb], the house is a detached house, but not far from other houses. The house has three bedrooms, bath and shower, and a front room of sixteen feet by thirteen feet, also there is a back room (cut off from front room by sliding doors) which measures sixteen feet by twelve feet. I live in the house with my wife and two daughters, We have an Austin 1,100 car in the tarmaced drive with a large garage at the top. 
I spend my spare time by, first reading the paper, (and doing the crossword), and then if its a dry day I will cut the grass and do some digging and planting bulbs. For our holidays we usually go to [town], the first time we came here, we stayed in a flat fairly close to the sea, the first time in the sea, my daughter fell in, and was crying for about an hour later, but we still enjoyed ourselves.
I sometimes play sport for the colege, also.
I really enjoy life!  Words: 231
