----------------------
I have a job as a short hand typist, part time in the morning. I am married and have one child by the age of five. He has just started school. I reach home by 2 o clock p.m. after work, that is if I have been shopping, so usually I get home about half past one. My child gets home about half past three as my sister, who is twenty eight, collects him, and her children from school in her car. When my husband gets home from work I make him a dinner and then my little boy goes to bed, having already had his tea. Later in the evening I either sketch, finish of paintings or watch the television. In the mornings my husband leaves for work at eight o,clock. a.m. and I take my little boy down to the shcool, leaving then straight for work. I have occasional holidays from work when I can shop in [London borough] or lunch with my mother or sister. I like gardening, and on Sundays we sit in the garden. If it is raining we find something to do indoors painting perhaps or playing cards. On Saturdays and Sundays, natrully there is more washing up so every one helps. Occasionally my husband takes me out to dinner. I like this very much and am always looking forward to the next evening out. Some-times for a joke I write my shopping list in shorthand.  Words: 242
