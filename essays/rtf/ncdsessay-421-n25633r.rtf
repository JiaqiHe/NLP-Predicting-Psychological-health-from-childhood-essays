Today I'm going to a new factory that makes models of different things. I use to love making them. 'I've come to work here.' I said to the manager. The manager who was Mr.[xxxxxxx]asked me a few questions. He decided that I should work in the boxing room. The next day I arrived on time and got to work on checking that the pieces had not fallen out. I noticed a model of a newcomen steam engine and that reminded me of my first school at St. Day. I thought the work was so easy until one the manager came on his rounds and saw that it was too easy for me. He had me transferred to loading and driving lorries. The lorry I drove was an old three tonmet and I had a puncture and no spare wheel when I was at least five miles from the nearest inhabbitance. I reached there about ten minutes later and asked the people if I could borrow their phone. I got going again about one hour after. I drove for a few hours then I reached the shop which I was heading for. At the age of twenty-five and 10 months I was asked by [xxxxxxx] to take his place for he was retiring in three months. I accepted this offer. I was manager for two weeks then I decided that polishing my trousers on an office chair was not suitable for me. I wanted to work not to be lazy. I asked another man whether he would like to be the manager and he accepted. I got back my job.  Words: 269
