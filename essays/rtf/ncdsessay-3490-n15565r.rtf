I am just out of University, I am living in a house in Glasgow. I have a golden labrador called Hector*. I have a budirigar and Guinea pig. I am a scientist. I specialise in medicine and the mind. I do not smoke ciggarettes because I will get cancer and I would get out of breath easily. I am married to a woman of 24. I have a car. It is a wolkswagone. I rise at 5.00. a.m. and go to bed at 10.00p.m. I goto the football on Saturdays. With my work as a scientist I hardly have time to go to church, but when I can get time, I go. I have a collection of records. I have a big radio gram. I have a half day ever Friday, so I goto the baths.  Words: 136
