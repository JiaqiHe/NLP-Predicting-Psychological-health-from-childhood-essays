My job is being a house wife, and I get a bit bored of being one. For days I have been searching around for a real job and I have finelly found one, I'm a waitress in a cafe twentyfive is a good age to start and I get xxxx9 5/- a week. I enjoy the job although boys whistle at me. I don't take any notice, my husband be has a job as a chief cook so if ever I'm late home Joe does the dinner. On sunday Joe and I pack some dinner and drive of into the country somewhere or even drive to the coast for a day, I enjoy life alot even all the bad days, Joe's hobbies are fishing, collecting, stamps, and swimming, and my hobbies are ice skating, skying, swimming, and looking after pets so you see why I enjoy life also me and Joe like sitting down and watching TV drinking tea. In my spare time I like playing the piano and danceing, at nights we go to a club called the ****.  Words: 180
