I live in a big house on the outskirts of Manchester, I work in a school and on Saturday I play football for [town] a town five miles from where I live. At the school I teach Mathicmatices & Games. I teach to a class of 14 year olds. My wife and I are happily married with two children one four and the other two. When I come home from school I have tea and then watch television. On Fridays I play darts for the local team. My only other interest is stamp collecting. On Saturdays when I play football my wife comes to watch me I am centre forward. My work is a nice job and I like it very much. Another feature about my work is that it is quite easy. The names of my two children are [male name] and [male name] they look like me and have the same colour hair and eyes as me. I have one car a Morris Oxford I kept it by my house. We also have a colour T.V. set. Our house has 4 bedrooms, all of them are quite big. I have got quite a big stamp collection of about 1,000 stamps from all over the world.  Words: 207
