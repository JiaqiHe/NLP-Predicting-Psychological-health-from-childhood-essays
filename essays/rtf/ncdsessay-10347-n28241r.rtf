In the 1983 I had got a job with animals somwhere and had got marrid. I bought a house in a small town. I enjoy Hiking and camping when on leave from work I would go bird watching and do a lot and field work on wild animals. I hope I will be able to go to Africa to study the animals in the game reserve's there I would not mind working on a game reserve if you got well payed. other wise I'd get a job with animals in England.
