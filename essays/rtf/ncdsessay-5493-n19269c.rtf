The life I am now leading is very interesting, I am working at a television studio in London. I see a lot of famous people that are on the television today. The camera I am using is one that gets close ups, and also used for zooming in on people. Tje longest film I have ever shown with my televion camera, was three hours all at once. My interests are now about the maps all over the world. I find swiming pleasent, the swiming barth is not very far away from my flat. I have got two pets in my flat a cat and a dog. When I go out of my flat they don't get lonely. I like reading books about classics. I get payed once a week, on Thursdays. I have Wednesdays and Sundays off, at work. And the hours are nine to seven o clock in the day. As soon as I come home after a hard days work, my dog gives me a welcome. Then when I have got my coat off I go in my kitchin and open a tin of dogs and cats food. My dog gobbles his food up, but my cat eats hers slowely and takes her time, about it. Then I put my oil stove on, and my television. Then I get myself a tin of something, and sit down put a tray on my lap and then I eat my meal, and watch television. I go to bed about eleven o clock. And start the day all over again.  Words: 259
