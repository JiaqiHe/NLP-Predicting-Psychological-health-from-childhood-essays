I am leading a successful life. I like playing at football, tennis, cricket, riding, collecting stamps, swimming singing and playing at golf. I am an artist and I have painted many pictures and made money with them. When I was twenty-one a painted 'A Jaguar' and got £50 for it. I have a sports car and I like to drive about the country in it. A few weeks ago there was a painting contest. I entered for it and won the first prize of £200. I bought a racing car and entered it in a few races. But I never won anything. So I entered my sports car for a rally and won third prize.  Words: 115
