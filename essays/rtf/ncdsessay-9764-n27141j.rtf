I have been through vetinary collage and I am now an assistant vet. I help Mr. [surname] with the parients. When he goes out on Wednesday afternoons, I take over. Soon, I am going to move to Ipswich and be a vet, there. In the summer I play tennis with fioncee. We are engaged, to be married in July. We are going on our honeymoon to Spain for a month. We go swimming a lot tog ether and last week we went to Devon. His name is Herman (of the Herman's Hermit's) but he is breaking up the group. He is going to buy all the night clubs in Ipswich and build some as well. He does not like a lot of layabouts in his clulb and he always dresses smartly. I always beat him at tennis. At the moment I am living with my mum and dad, but after we're married, as I said before, we are moving to Ipswich into a newly-built block of flats. We go riding at my friend [female name]'s stables where we have our own homes. Yesterday, we went out and bought a hundred copies of his latest record, my sentimental friend. His last record, he is going to dedicate to me.  Words: 208
