When I am 25 years old I would to be a hairdresser or a red cross teacher because I like hairdressing very much and I also like seeing to people who have hurt there self because it is not very nice seeing someone when hurt because it is not very nice for the person who has hurt for they might be a fraid of blood or something like that. I like doing some house work like polishing and washing things or dusting makeing beds and cleaning windows and all things like that I like looking after babies when they do not cry all the time I might go to a womans club but not a lot because if I have children they will need to be looked after because if I get married my husband can not look after them all the time because it would not be fair he got to out sometimes to mens club or something like that. I would like children to be clean because every baby would call them scurffs and that would not be nice for them to be called scruffs because I no I would not like to be called a scruff my self because it makes you funny to be called it. I would like to be a tipst because I like tipewritting very much and I would like follow after my brouther girlfriend I would like to be a cook because I like cooking very much.  Words: 245
