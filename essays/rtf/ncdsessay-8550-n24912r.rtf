I have nice long holidays in which I do a part time job of being a waitress so that I have a little a little money to spend. When I am on holiday I help do the house-work. I go out too, with my friends perhaps to the pictures or a ride in the country. 
      When I finish at college I hope to be a veterinary surgeon. I will have pets of my own. After I finish college I'll go into the country side out in Devon and be a vet out there. With a nice little cottage with a thatched roof and there will be only downstairs. At the back of my cottage I'll have a very long and wide garden with a great big lawn. Down near the bottom of my garden there will be a medium sized pond with fish in it. When I was called out to help with sick animals perhaps farm animals or house pets. In my house I would have two bedrooms, a study, a kitchen, a lounge and dining room seperate. My lounge will look out onto the garden out of the French Windows. In the middle of my lawn I will have an old oak tree. There would be woods near my house. Where I can take the dog for a walk. My car* would a little dark blue IMP  Words: 253
