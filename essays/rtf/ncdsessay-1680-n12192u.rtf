I am 25 years of age and I play football for the football team '[football club]'. My iterest is of course is football as it has been all my life I am a batchelor so I am not married and I have no children. I live with my mother and father in [road], where I have lived nearly all my life. For a part time Job I am working in the co-op and drive a van in the summer. A number of my interests are fishing and cricket and I some times play tennis as I have played this nearley all my life. I lead a very out door life and I are nearly always training with [football club]. I nearly always go to [town] for my holidays as I like it very much I also play bowls on the bowlng green across the road from our house The reson why I am not married is because I think that women are very fussy and chatty. (as I have done all my life). I visit many places with me being in a football team but the place that as all my life facinated me is london whith its massive buildigs is London. The other place wich facinates me as well is New York City where we have been visiting because they now play football  Words: 224
