I now have a job. I am 25 years of age now. I wish I was young and still going to school, roaming across the feilds and through the woods. I am interested in wild life and nautural things. Now I am a game keeper and have three children, two boys and a girl. I like my job very much Ive learned a lot since I left school, I married at twenty and have been married five years. I get fourteen pounds week. I like to walk by my self and stoody the birds and their wayes. I keep dogs when other people go on holidays. I earn three pounds for one dog a week, I finsh my work at 10.30 every night, now I am breeding partrige, pheasant and mallade. Most of the eggs hached off in to chicks I only have one meal a day, that is at night. For my meal I have roast rabbit most of the time. When I was young I thought I would like to be an engineer and* work a kaear*.  Words: 179
