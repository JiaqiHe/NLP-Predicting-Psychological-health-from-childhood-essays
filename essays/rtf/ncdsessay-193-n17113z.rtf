Saturday is a busy time, for lots of people come and have their hair done. I had to have a lot of training to be a hair dresser it was very hard work I make lots of friends here and my best friend is called [xxxxxxx] She is 28 she and I put our money together and we save and when it beings to get hot and really sunny we go on holiday abroad. I have a brother and sister both younger than me my brothers name [xxxxxxx] and my sister [xxxxxxx]. I often take them out to places and they quite enjoy Themselves. One day a girl at work told me and [xxxxxxx] that She was having a party and she invited us.

He took me out a lot after that day and we had good tines together but one day he came to my house and told me he was going to move. I asked him the address it was a long way away, tonight would be the last night I would see him. I would go and see his sometimes but not as much as before so our friendship came to an end.
