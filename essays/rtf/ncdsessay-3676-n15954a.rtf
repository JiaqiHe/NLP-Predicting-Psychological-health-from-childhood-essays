"I am now 25 years old I am a cartoonist for the Daily Express. I base my cartoons on what ever comes up in the every day life. I live in north london and I have a little cottage in Buckinghamshire. My hobby is making plastic models of all kinds. I own two cars, a mini minor and a Jenson sports car. I live in a bunglow, it has a large garden at the back and a garden at the front. On sunday I go down to the local golf club before coming home to lunch. On saturday after noons I go to see Burnley football club play at thier home matchs. When I go on holiday I go to a small little village, called **** in Sufolk. I have a wife - Joan and two boys - Zac and Chrispin, Zac is 6 and Chris' is 2. Sometimes when Burnley play away we go downto the cottage, and somtimes I ask my brother Phillip, to come down to. On Friday nights we go roller-skating to the ""rink"" about a mile away. I very rarely now, are asked to desighn posters. (cartoon off corse)"  Words: 194
