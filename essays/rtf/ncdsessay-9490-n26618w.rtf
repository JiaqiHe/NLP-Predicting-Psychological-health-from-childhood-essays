I'm now twenty five and I work at a soap factory this is my machine the wrapper it wraps soap. In my spare time I play darts for the pub team. I live in (place) in a slum. My ladady (name) takes xxxx3 in rent but the rent is xxxx2 a week, she appears on court tuesday. My pay is xxxx22 for 12 hours work. I own a mini car. I spend most of my time fixing it. I star gaze at night the over day i thought I saw a U.F.O but it was a space ship coming back from mars.  Words: 102
