When I'm 25

I would get married to somone who can cook rather well and is not fat. And then get a very good job like an office man and I could see my wife very often, and that I could have some children and I could get a house in the country. And get a good hillman car that does'nt break down and where ther would be some piece and quiet away from roaring lorries & workers. and where I could enjoy myself & my children could.  Words: 87
