At 25 years old, I world have got a house by then and I would be marid by then. I would think that I would work about 5 days a week, and work as a micanic. I would have a care by then, and sometime I would go out for the week-end. I would watch football as much as I could on T.V. And now and a gen I would go to watch spur's play, for my holiaday I would like to go to span and serf ride and I mite have my own mot-a-boat And go diving at span, I think I would be liveing in Cornwall and have a farm and my perants would be liveing with me. I would have some horses of my own and cows* sheep and kinds of farm animals, I would have a gream Dan as well as my other dog. I would go on my horse as mast as posable and go to the beach an often I could And when I bring my boat back from span I owuld go fishing in it by the coast of Cornwall.  Words: 187
