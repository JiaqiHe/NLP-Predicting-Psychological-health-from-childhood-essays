I will wake up in the morning get dressed and make myself some breakfast. Then I will rush down to the stables where I work as a riding instructor. Then I help some of the other girls to muck out tack up the ponies (Grooming them first of course) Then Ill get the first pupils mounted up and [female name] will take them for the 8 o'clock ride. Meanwhile I will go in to the small office amd look up in the book to find out which rides I am suppoesed to be taking. I take about four rides in the morning and five in the afternoon 
At 1 o'clock I will stop for lunch. Since my house is quite near the stables I go home and have my lunch there. I have a little thatched cottage painted white the windows are black with diamond shaped panes. Each window has decorative shutters with little window boxes. Inside all the walls are painted white exept my bedroom it is done in primrose yellow. I have spent a lot of money on this house and I am very proud of it with my pretty house to keep clean and a good job in the stables altogether I lead a very full and happy life.  Words: 212
