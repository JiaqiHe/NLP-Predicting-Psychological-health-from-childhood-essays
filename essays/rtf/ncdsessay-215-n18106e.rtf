'Now that I am twenty five I think I'll get a proper job in an office or something like that. Or I could always get an exciting job like I used to say I would get when I was only about 9 such as Skin diving, House demolitioner a Soldier, or I could always sign on for a foot-ball team. Although I'm interested in those jobs I don't think I would be very good at any of them except for office job. In the bank I've only got £600 so I won't by a house until I'm married. Any way I think I better ring up my pal and see if he can come out tonight.' Pay 4-1-0-3 ...... 'hello paynton 4103 who is it there please.' 'it's Geoffrey here could I please speak to Jonny please,' 'alright just hang on a minute while I get him.' A few minutes later: 'hello Geoff,' 'Hi, look can you come out tonight for a cycle ride,' 'yes I'll be round at about half past severn,' 'right bye,' 'bye' Half past severn that night. 'Mum,' 'yes,' replied mum Johny's at the door so can I go out now.' 'alright, but be in for nine o'clock,' 'O.K. bye.' 'Where should we go,' 'I don't no,' 'but have you decided what job your going to get yet John,' 'I've already got one,' said John 'Oh what is it?'  Words: 233
