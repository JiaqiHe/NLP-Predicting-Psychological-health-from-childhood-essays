When I come home from work at about 5,o'clock I help with the tea and washing up then sometimes alter my clothes or mend my things. I am going to the cinema tonight so I go up stairs and was and change into suitable clothes then say goodbye and go. On Saturday afternoons I often go to the town and do some shopping then hunt around shoe shops and dress stores and if I have the money I buy something. On Sunday afternoons I dress in trousers a jumper and suitable walking shoes and go for a walk with my boyfriend.  Words: 101
