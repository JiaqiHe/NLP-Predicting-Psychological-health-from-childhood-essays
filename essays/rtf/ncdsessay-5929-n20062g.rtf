My home is 3 bedroomed house near the country It has a stable in the garden where I keep my horses, I have two, a palamino and shetland. The shetland has a long mane, hanging round his neck, and a white fluffy tail. The palamino has a rather short mane with a long tail which he whips me with. I also have a donkey who gets a bit Jealous when I groom daylight and bob-tail my horses.
      My job is also nice, I am a secetary. I work from 8 to 7. I have Saturday and Sunday off. On this time off I somtimes help down at the riding school, Which is a little way away from my house. I help leading the little children. My favouroute pony down there is spider, he is black. My hobbies at home are dancing, I go dancing every sunday night with my friend. Sometimes on Tuesday night I go to the pictures. Quite often I have to go abroad with my job I dont have to pay my fare, because it consurns my job so my boss dose. He's quite a big man with a patch on his head. He also wears glasses. he is sort of a funny man. One day hes nice and kind and the next hes shouting the place down I never know what to expect, I just keep hoping. His wife is nice, She makes me cups of tea, and she can handle her husband too, I wish I could. They have a most lovely house. too.  Words: 259
