I like the job I have got it is in a store. I take a lot of interests in it. At work I have to work on a food store. When I am at home I like doing jobs for my mum. I like the life. The best things I like are washing up, cleaning the windows, cleaning the floors and washing the clothes. My interests are going to the cinema, knitting and sewing. I like skating too. I enjoy the live I am leading. But the best thing I like doing is writing stories and reading books.  Words: 98
