The age of twenty five is a very interesting age. I work as a rep at a rubberie industrie head quarters at [town], though I live forty miles away at Birmingham so I have travel at least eighty miles in a weekday. I have been abroad a lot, I have been to Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Germany. I also travel about England going to Kent, London sometimes I go up to Scotland. At home I get little chance to play with my two children for it is unusual to find me earlier the seven o'clock p.m.
The house where I live is on the border between [suburb] and [suburb] and the gaden was very untidy when we bought it so most of my spare time is taken up in straightening and relaying slabs in my garden. My elder son [male name] who was christened after me had a main interest of sport especially football, my elder son is at waiting impatiently for the results of his eleven plus.  Words: 167
