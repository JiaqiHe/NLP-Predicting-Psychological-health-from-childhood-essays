I am a French Horn Player. I play for the opera at [opera house]. In the Summer Holidays I stay with my parents* who live in the country. They live in Scotland. In [city] I live in a house quite a way out of [city] with my husband and my two children. My daily rota is usually like this. At half-past seven I get up and make the tea for my husband and myself, then I dress, after that I make the breakfast and we eat it, then I clear it away. I take the children to school then and on the way back I do the shopping. Then I clean the house. After that I go to [opera house] for a reherseal, this is about two hours. When I come back I cook myself some lunch. It is only myself to cook lunch for because the children are at school and my husband is at work all day. After lunch I go to the opera house first for a matinee performance then an evening performance. I usually get home about 11 o'clock. Meanwhile my husband finished his work at half-past three then he went on to collect the children from school.  Words: 202
