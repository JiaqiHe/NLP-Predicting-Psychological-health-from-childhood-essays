I am now twenty-five years old and I work in a factory in [road] Which is called [company], were they make salt and peper holders and the salt and peper glass things. When I go home I cook our dinner at dinner time which is twelve o'clock, when I have to go back to work at one o'clock I do my Job, then when it is hometime I go home and do the tea. Of a Sunday I go to mas and there I put money on a plate like all the other people do, And when I come back from mas I make the dinner.
