I am an enginer working on a roundabout in [city], which has to circle the citty, it has to be four lane. Its perimiter is 60 miles. Every job leads me to somewhere different.
      I have a dog it's name is Hector he is a Pyreanean Mountain dog. He is two years old. I have a small house in [county], and one is [county] the rest of the time I rent flats. I have a small sports car.
      I still make models I have a vaste colleciton of over a thousand. jets, cares, tanks, U.F.O.'s and ships. 
      I like the country air and often ramble in the woods, and fields with my dog, or playing with the dog in the garden. At home there are books to read, gramopnes to listen to and the five television channels to chose from. The large garden gets me down, as I do not like gardening. I go fishing on a nearby lake, and boating on the river.  Words: 165
