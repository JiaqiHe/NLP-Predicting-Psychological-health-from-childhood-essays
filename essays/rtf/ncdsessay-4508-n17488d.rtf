I am not married yet. I am working in [company] as a shop assistant. I am saving up to be married. If I have children I might call them [name], [name] [name] and [name]. I have had a very nice life. I am interested in music and swimming. I would like my husband to be a mnager of a pub. My dad worked in a pub in [town]. I wouldn't go out to play every night when I was ten, I'd sit in and read comices or watch television. I go to night clubs with my freind. It is very hard at work you get up at half-past seven in the morning.  Words: 112
