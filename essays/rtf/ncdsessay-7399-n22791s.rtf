I am twenty five years old and I am wanting to be a lady doctor. I like to have nice clothes and I like to stay clean. I am trying very hard to be a lady doctor. I go to a college and I have got a lot of freinds at the college who are very kind to me, and because I am coloured they like to keep me happy all the time and I enjoy my life with my friends I like to go out and I wear nice clothes, and while I'm out I like to enjoy myselfe with my friends. I'm willing to be a lady doctor because I like to be a lady doctor. Then when I am a lady doctor I am going back to our country to go and work in a hospital and the people will be willing to haev me because they want sombody that knows english because they have'nt got many people who know English. In our country people who are ill have* to pay for staying in the hospital and tou have to pay money for the medicine and injections.  Words: 190
