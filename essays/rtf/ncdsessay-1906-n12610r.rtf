I would also have an hobby to pass some time away when I am not travelling then perhaps I shall be a detective and I will have to solve mysteries, perhaps I will have a hobby about studying the different kinds of stones or something like that I might collect stamps I might have lots of other hobbies. I would like to have lot's of friends and I would like to have friend in the policeforce aswell I go to parties and dances I would have a horse and I would buy a field to keep it in then I will buy a saddle and then I will be able to ride it in the field.
