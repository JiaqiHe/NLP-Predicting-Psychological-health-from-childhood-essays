I have anything particular in mind at the moment what sort of job I would do but I am definatly not going to do something like helping to build cars etc because it would mean doing the same things day in and day out. I would like a job that I could earn a good pay packet (not exesive) with and also one which means I am not confined to a certain place. I would not mind to start a career in the army or for that matter I would just as much enjoy being a teacher or even better a headmaster. My intrests are in swiming, aviation (early. 1910-1930) and sports (of any type). I would not live in a particularly expensive house but one costing around xxxx6000.
