I would hope that I would still have my stamp colletions and hope to lead gay jet not so gay a life. If I was married I would hope to have a part time job and still be able to go out once in a while. This is what I hope a day in my life would be, I would wake up about half past six, get my husband of to work than about eight I would wake the children and get them of to school, than I would wash up and tidy the place, than I would go to work at about half past nine I would hope that my husband and the children could stay dinner and I would finish work in time for the children to come home. Than my be once a week I could go out if to Young Wifes or somewhere like that. I don't thinke I would have many hobbies because being a Wife a Mother and to go out to work, there would not be enough time and if there was not enough time to do my stamps I should give it to one of my children so they could carry it on. As for my job I hope that I could be a teacher of some caned.  Words: 216
