I am now 25 yrs. old and married to a man in the R.A.F. I have two children, one boy and one girl. They are called [female name] and [male name]. We are living in Scotland, by the sea which is not very far from the highlands. In my spare time I knit jumpers ect. for the children and make their clothes.
When the family has gone to school and my husband gone to work I just do the house-work and if I am hoovering I suck up the cats loose hairs with the hoover. 
In the weekend the family would go for a drive, sometimes by the sea and sometimes in the hills. In the holidays we would sometimes go pony trekking. If we found anything interesting. such as a birds nest with baby birds peeping out then we would take photos of them if we have the camera with us. 
At night if there was a dance on at the Seargants mess we would proberly go and have a drink or two and maybe a dance.
I lead a very happy life with my family and enjoy myself very much and hope life may go on just as well.  Words: 199
