I am in America enjoying live very much, I am a journalist for the weekly news. I am now trying to find out some bank robbers. I am married and I have got two children a girl called [female name] [female name], and a boy called [male name] [male name], they are away at bording school. My husband and I do alot of climbing and bicking. When I at home I try cooking different things out of recipe book, and give them to my husband to try out. When the children are on holiday we take the camping and rock climbing. When we have our weekend of we go biking for miles and miles. 
Some times we go swimming. At night sometimes we have party for varuse reasons, like slabraing the 4th July and things link that. Every two years we go to England for our holidays. We tkae the children round the English country side. Then the next year my Mam and Dad come over to us. And we show them all the American country side. Really I do lead a very good live  Words: 185
