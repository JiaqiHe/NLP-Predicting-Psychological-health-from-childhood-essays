----------------------
I am a housewife and have 3 children [female name] and [female name] who are twins and 1 year old and [female name] who is 2. I live in a semi-detached house in a quiet road. I enjoy making cakes and jam etc for my family I find this much more enjoyable than buying them. I have a quiet husband who has a good job as an engineer and he's very good with the children when I am out. He is dark haired with brown eyes and is always ready to help. I belong to a swimming club and sometimes take [female name] with me to get her used to the water. I belong to evening clubs on cookery boating and dressmaking. I sometimes go the cinema with my husband. 
We often go to the coast for holidays but we would rather go to Scotland or Wales. We are saving up and hope to go Italy in a few years time. I knit most of my childrens wollies as I find they wear better and are cheaper. I often babysit in the evenings for friends. I am a part time teacher at a Junior School where I teach swimming. I hope soon that I will be able to enter three children into a Swimming Gala.  Words: 215
