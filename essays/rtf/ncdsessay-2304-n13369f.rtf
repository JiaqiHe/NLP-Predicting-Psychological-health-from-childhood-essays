I am a piolot at the moment flying a [aeroplane]. The course I am on from London is Paris then Madrid, Lisbon, New York. Brazilia and then Back again. On Saturdays I play football for [football club]. I am married with three children. I have broght five acreas of land and building houses on it. When I am abroad I usally buy things which you can not get in England. I am thinking of living in Canada near my friends you live there. Iam very fond of camping and we usally go to South Wales when I am home from work. In a few years time I will be flying a Concorde. I will get better money for that. I would say about xxxx150 a week which is quite alot. With this new job with more money I am thinking of buying a few pubs. At the moment we have got quite a large house with five bedrooms. We think it is nice only because we planned it out and built it. We have a very big garden down the very bottom of the garden we have a orchard and we grow vegetables. All the rest is lawns trees bushes and flower beds. Just down the road my mother lives in a bungalow. We have two cars because my wife can drive, a Rover and a Austin. We have two garages and a very big drive. For pets we have two rabbits, a tortise, two dogs, and some goldfish. I do put some money on the horses every now and again I do not win very much though.
