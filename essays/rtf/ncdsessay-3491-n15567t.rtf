I am twenty-five years of age and enjoying life. I am at work as a draughtsman and this satisfies me. The pay is good. I have many hobbies; swimming, stamp-collecting, football and card-collecting; those are just some of them. I live in a detached house in [town] with a wife and two children. I watch and listen to sports, stories, comedy and the news on both television and radio. So do the children. I think they are more enthusiastic than I am! Once a year we go off in our caravan for three weeks in the holiday. Our car is a Triumph 2000 and it is in good condition. Once a month my wife, the childrne and I go to visit my parents; another month my wife's. I am a member of a golf club and a swimming club. I like reading alot. I have just finished reading "Reach for the Sky" which I have borrowed from the library. I also like music. Whether it's pop, classic or jazz I don't really care. The children and I went to see Watford F.C. play last Saturday at home to Tottenham Hopspur. They won 2-0. Before I was a draughtsman I used to go to a University at Reading. Well I'm happy with life; good job, good hobbies, and a happy family.  Words: 220
