"At the Moment I am joint head of a Nursery garden called ""[business name]"". We are Specialising in Rhododenrons, Camelias and Roses. I have taken this job up from my father. The garden is not very big but in about five years we hope it to be as big as my father's which my older bother will inherit.
When I am not working I am trying to make a new fertalizer which will help Rhododenrons to grow in bed soil. Because not many people have the right Soil for Rhododenrons.
Also Iam Saving up for a Small swimming pool because I have a wife and one boy. The boy is very keen to swim. And he also wants to become a marksman at shooting so Iam going to soon start to teach him to shoot with my old Air Rifle.
In the situation of money we are doing alright. Our house is a small one and quite cheap and Ihave a MG 1100 to go to work in. The house is in the country so we have quite a large garden."  Words: 178
