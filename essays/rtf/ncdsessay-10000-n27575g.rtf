I am 25 years old, and I am married to a very hansome boy. I have always wanted to be a secretary and I have a chance. I have two babies, one girl and one boy. My husbands name is [male name], and my name is [female name]. I work at a school in Knowle. I live in a house in the country, it is a white house with ivy crawling up, the garden has tulips and daffodils in. It has a little garden, with a lawn in the middle. We have painted the house, blue, green & yellow. My husband works at a postoffice, he gets lot of money as well as me. My children go to school, and have sixpence every day, that is 7 shillings. I would be able to pay for the bills, and would have alot of money over. So I would bye a posh house and have it the best, if my huspand would agree with me. My children would not agree, because of thier friends, and my huspand would not agree because of his job he might not get another one. So I was the only one really, who wanted to go. I would like to go because I am fed up with my own house all the time
Being a secretary is very lucky because a lot of people have looked, but cant get the job.  Words: 233
