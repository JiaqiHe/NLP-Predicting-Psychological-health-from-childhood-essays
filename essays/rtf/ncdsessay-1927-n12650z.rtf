I work in a stufy office all day have 1 hr for lunch break. I set off at 5 am. in the morning and leave at 3pm and get home around half past 3 to 4. It takes me about 1/2 an hour to get home. When I get home I have my tea and watch tv. Then go to bed around 11pm. My house stands near a church, and about a mile down the road is the village. All I have to do in the morning is walk out of the door and across the road to the bus-stop and a nomber 99 comes round every half hour and picks me up. That bus takes me the the city about 9 miles away from the village the I catch a nomber 1 to [street name] St. There my friend gives me a lift in his car to work. when I get there, there is plenty of work to do, that carries me through to tea break at 9am. then I go to the printers and get some paper for my work. All I do is calculations and nombers. We manifacture airoplanes. we make about 19 a year. The type we make a boing 707's. Three have all ready done 9 flights each. All the parts are made seperate when all the parts are made up and painted we send them to a hanger in bristol. The parts take about 3 month's to fix up. Then when they are fixed up the name of the plane is written on the side and BOAC. in capital letters. I am going to bet married next week. Eventually the day came The best man was my friend who takes me to work in the morning.  Words: 292
