I live in a small furnished flat and I do many things in it. I have a small mini car which is blue. Nearly every evening I go out in it and visit people I know. Sometimes they give parties and they invite me to them. I like doing knitting and makeing things to eat. Sometimes I go out for walks in different parks and other places. At weekends when I am home from work I go and see places of intererst. Like [castle], [palace] and other places. The job which I do is a short-hand typist in a big office. I have to be at work at 9.30am and I come home frome work at 3.30 p.m.. I go on my car to work as it is a long way from where I live. On the way home I go through the [area]. Sometimes I go straight out to the cinema or to dances. I have to have many different dresses so I have to earn quite a lot of money. Sometimes when I go out straight from work I get home about 6.45pm. so I do not have much time at home. Other times if I went straight home I would have freinds to dinner. Or I would read books and listen to music. Sometimes neighbours invite me in to their house to talk to me about various things. I go to evening classes too, to interest me in the evenings when I get bored. I go to shows aswell with freinds. Or I go skating at ice rinks and watch too. the libary is another place to go. I can read books there or take some home.  Words: 280
