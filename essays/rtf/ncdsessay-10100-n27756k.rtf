I am an actor and I tour the country with the rest of the actors. I still live in the same house at [town] My sister does not live there now as she is married. I have several friends at the club and I am very happy there. At the moment I am living at home as the season is finished for the time being. As an actor my work involves a lot of time doing rehearsals at the theatre so while we are starting a new play I live in 'digs'. I also read many new plays through and write* my opinion of them in a few papers. I go to the cinema quite a lot to see some films or at other times I play with a very large train set which I have built up through time.  Words: 140
