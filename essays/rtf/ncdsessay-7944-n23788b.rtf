I am twenty-five years old. I work in a hair-dressing saloon. I get three pounds a week. I own a flat in London I listen to many pop-records and try keep up with the fashion in clothes. I enjoy it very much working in the saloon. Almost every night I go to clubs, with some of my friends and to dances. I get my rent from my mother, she sends it to me by post, but when I get a bit more money for working I will be paying it my self. I do not have much furniture in my flat, only a single bed, dressing table, setee, two chairs and a television set. I also have a mini car and I go out very often. In the summer I go camping with some of my friends. I also go to Clacton, and stay in a caravan site. I enjoy swimming a lot. I like playing tennis and I like doing gymnastic's and any other sport. My abition is to become a professianal hair-dresser.  Words: 174
