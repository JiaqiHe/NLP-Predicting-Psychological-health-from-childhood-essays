I am a moter mechanic for team Lotus. I travle all round the world going to different grand prixs. I see that the engines are all tuned right and the air spoilers are on right, I chek the suspension. And change the tyres. There is great exitmentt in the pits when we win a race.
I do not spend too much time at home because I am too busy in the grand prix season. And even when there are no races to bother with I am still busy designig new cars. And engines and thinking of better ways to hold the car on the ground.
durring the race you might think its up to the driver. But when the car breaks down he come into the pits and its up to the mechanick to get it going agian, go fast as posable and as good. because if we go fast but the car is going worse than before it woud be no good would it. So we have to do it as fast as possible and as good  Words: 176
