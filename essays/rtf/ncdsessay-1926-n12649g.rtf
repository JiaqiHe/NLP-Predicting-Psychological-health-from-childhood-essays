"I am now an aircraft training instructor and teach people who have just left school like I did once. The people who come to me are trained to fly for B.O.A.C. They have to have about one year with me learning how to handle different craft. ""When I was a boy I used to regard jets as Concorde over there,"" I point my hand to an elegant plane on the runway."" ""As very exciting and when I saw the controls on her, I used to gasp with amazement at how complex they were. Now of course they are every day life to you.""
After the novices who aren't leave me they go to a different instructor who gives them checkings and so on they start there carear as a pilot. Mind you flying these birds aren't just taking off and coming down they have to be good mathematians, but not nearly as good as they had to be 20 years ago when they had to write down courses and follow those. We have now got the computer to do the job for us. Good Luck!"  Words: 184
