I would help at home as much as I could. I would like to do the shopping. I would like going for walks. In a morning I should like to sotp in bed. Every day almost I would see if I could find a Job. I would like to work in a green grocers shop or a bread shop. When I get a Job I would work very hard and take much intrest in it If I could not work in a shop I would like to be a childs nurse somewhere away. I should write plenty of letters to let my parents know how I was getting on. If I was a childs nurse I would go on a many walks and picnics as I could with the children. When I get to about 28 I would probley start thinking about getting married and having* a familey of my own. If by chance I did get married I would start looking for some where to live. When I found somewhere to live I would work a great deal harder because I would have to work so hard then to earn a living - for my self and my familey. If I did not like been married to this* man I would try not to show that I diddn't. I would try to make my child very happy but I would make sure it worked well. When I get to about 38 I would have to stop work as hard as I had been. Almost every year I would make arrangements for the family and myself to go for a holiday abroad somewhere. When my child grew up I would be fairly old then so I would like it to make a life of it and get married like I did.  Words: 301
