When I am twenty five and leave collage . I am going to plan modern houses. which have flat rooves and build them under ground. so it saves crushing up. They would have large gardings and an indoor swimming pool . I hope to build many of them and my idea becomes common in the world . I don't like the tall skyscrappers and flats . They have to walkup stairs or on a life which often gets stuck or does not work . They are powered by a genorater.Ifitbreaks down all the houses are without electricity . But my houses are powered by its own genorator and if it break down a spare one keeps it going till the other one is mended.  Words: 124
