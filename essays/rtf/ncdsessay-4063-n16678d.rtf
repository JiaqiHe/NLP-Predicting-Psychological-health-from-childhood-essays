"I am an R.A.F. aprentist shorley to leave and join Civil airlines, I have won my flying wings and fly an English Electric Fighter, jet powered. 
I live at a place just outside **** air training collage, I am married and have a small child named Michel*. As I am still an aprentist I carn* about fifteen pounds a week. 
My main interests are stamp collecting, collecting profiles on old aircraft, and, or course flying. I don't think I am making too bad a start in ***e, but dad says that if I don't we that R.A.F.*****ship of mine, I'm sunk. I am allways wondering which airline I will go in, I get out of the R.A.F.
Its not a bad job, the R.A.F., and the lockheed lighting fighter is not a bad aircraft, but it sometimes gets a bit lonley sitting there, upstairs as we call it, with only the controls to play with A fighters area* consists of three men, although only one man does the flying, a fighter needs serviceing whilst it is on the ground, so we have a ground crew as well, they are known as the ""Fitter"" and the ""Rigger."" When the lightning is in flight it is highley manouverable, and, infact, taking time into con**deration, the lightning as good as the supermarine spitfire of world war two. In my homelife, when I'm not on duty that is, I have great games with my little son and our faithfull old dog Cindy. Although Cindy is getting old now, she still enjoys a good game of ""tug-o-war'."
