"""Hello,"" I am a house wife and also a mother. I have got two children. They are leading me a terrible life for they just wont do as they are told. My husband goes to work early and me and my helper have to get the chidren ready for school for I have always got plenty of house work to do. My helper only helps me with the children then she goes to another job. I am not only leading a live with the children but with the motherinlaw. She hates me and I know it. Sometimes I'd wished that I had never married him. We have arrgues over silly things. She starts the argues ever time. The children are on two and three. Sometimes my motheringlaw justs walks past me in the street and the three year old one says why dont you talk to her mummy? They just dont understand. I try to be nice to her infact I am nice to her but she just throws kindness back in your face. I like taking the children out for walks and going on the beaches* They love going for a paddle. Thats the only way that I can stop them riving up the house is taking them on the beach. I like to sun bathe, I wash the paint work in the house every day and hover. I wash clothes about three times every week for the children get so dirty playing in the back yard. I love cooking and bakeing. I wash the cooker down every day after tea. I think my motheringlaw will calm down as we go alone."  Words: 273
