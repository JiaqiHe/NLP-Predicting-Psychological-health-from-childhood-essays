I have a house in Scotland but most of the time, except in the holidays, I live in a flat in London. I am interested i nhorses and other animals. I would like to be a vetinary sergeon and help animals and birds in the RSPCA. At home I read books and study animals. In the mornings I would take my dogs out for a run. My favourite breeds of dogs are collies, long haired, St. Bernards, Labradors, and Alsations. In the holidays, I would go on a tour of the world and stay on a cattle ranch in Mexico. My flat in London would be modern but the house in Scotland would be old fashioned. It would have a yard and stables where i would keep two horses. In my spare time, I would go to france and stay with a french family, so that I could learn french better. In London, I would go out for lunch in the week days but cook my own at the weekends and sometimes have a friend to stay. I would have a groom to feed the horses and the other animals while I am away.  Words: 194
