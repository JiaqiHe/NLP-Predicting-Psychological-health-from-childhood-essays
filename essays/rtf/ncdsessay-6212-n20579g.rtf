When I am twenty I will be a secretary (I hope). I will have a hard Job if I am a mother becaise I will have a lot of hard and tiring work nevertheless its better than being idle. If I have children of course if old enough they will be able to help me. In my spare time I will probably make clothes for my children like knitting Jumpers, cardigans, gloves, hats etc, and make dresses and things like that. I will make sure that my home is always clean and tidy and that no strangers are allowed in. I will do my weekly shopping on a Saturday and I will get enough to last the whole week. I would like to be a secretary because its a good Job and you earn good money. I want to do shorthand typing aswell because that also could help me at home and I could teach my children how to use a typeriter aswell. I also like piano lessons I hope to be able to play the piano when I am twenty-five which I can also teach my children. In my house I will make sure that no one gets it dirty without cleaning it up after them. If I have a garden I will look after it well and plant nice flowers in it and if I have a hedge I will cut it regularly to keep keep it tidy and neat aswell. I will take driving lessons and I will keep on trying till I pass my test. and then I will buy a car which is big enough for the whole family, and I can't think of anything else  Words: 281
