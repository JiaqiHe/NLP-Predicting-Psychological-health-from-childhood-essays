I am twenty five years of age I work in a office as a short hand typest. I live in a flat not very far from my work. When I get home and have my tea. I then tidy up for the next day. On saturday I go shopping and if it is to hot in the afternoon I go swimming at the public baths. But if it is to cold I go down to the pet shop to look at the animals. On sundays I usely watch tely or I go to see the flower at London airport also to see the planes lift off. But if it is very cold I go to see my mother or I stay at home with my dog (name). In the flat next to me lives a girl who goes out everysaturday to the dance I sometimes come with her. Now you know my story of myself.  Words: 155
