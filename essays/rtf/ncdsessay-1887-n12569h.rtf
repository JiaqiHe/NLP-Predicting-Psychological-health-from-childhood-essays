If I was 25 years old I would be a teacher. I would have a class of about 40 children. I would not yet be married. I would teach in a primary school. First I would have to go to a place where they teach you how to teach. I would enjoy teaching maths english history and art. I would live in a flat and would read lots of books and I would collect stamps and fossils. I would save my money in a bank. I would watch telivision in the evenings and sometimes go to the cinema. I would have some of friends living near me who I would sometimes go out with. I would enjoy going swimming. I would probally belong to a sports club. It would probally be a cricket club. I would have a small car. I would not smoke very much and I would probally not drink. The flats I live in would not be in the middle of a town they would probally be just outside it. I would go for walks when I had nothing to do. I would go abroad a few times to France or America or holland or somewhere like that. I would probally have a pet most likely a dog.  Words: 211
