When I am 25 I would like to continue with my studies and go on to College and then take a training course in English. After I have learnt all I want to in English I would go and train in Music. Then I would go to a few countries trying to learn their language. After that I would return to England. And get married. I would then have a few babies. So that my life would not seem empty. When the children are about 15 I hope I will not be more than 37. I would then send the children to a boarding school. If I can afford it and have not to many When they are at a boarding school I will go and learn to dance if I am not to stiff. While my husband will be out at work. When the children return from school, they will be 18 Ready in some sort of training for want they want to be. I will now then be about 42. I will be able to dance a little and sing a bit. And by this time my children are 25 I will be about 50. And I hope not ashamed of anything I might have done in my lfe. And that is what I hope to do with my life when I am 25. It is only a brief outline but that is how I want it.  Words: 239
