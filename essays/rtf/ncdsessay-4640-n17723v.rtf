When I am 25 I will be married with two children one boy and one girl, we have a lovely garden and a big house, we had a car but we sold it to the uncle, After a bit I will be starting work and I will be working at a dispensery with sick animals to helped them get better. In my spare time I go to nursery school with little children. My hobbys are horse-riding, looking after animals, I have lots of hobbys but those are my two best hobbys. I go to work nearly every day but I have Sunday and Saturday off. My husbund works has an engeneir like mend cars and things like that, While I am off of work on a saturday I do some cooking like baking buns and cake, After work the time is about 5'o'clock I come home, I put the children to bed then give my husband his supper. And then go to bed.  Words: 163
