TodayisMy birthday I am 25 year's old and I have had my presant. Now for another day at work although I like my job very much I am a Nanny for young children I have to be at the house for nine O clock in the morning. At the moment I am a Nanny for twins who are three years old. I am now off to work for the day I am thinking of taking them to the park to play on the swings and roundabout as they get bored at home all the time. I have just arrived at there home and I am dressing them in coats and hats we have now set out and we have crossed the main road to the park first they went on the slide and now the swings and now the slide again but it is twelve O clock and we have to be back for dinner it is a good job the only live across the road. We walked across the road had my dinner and went home.  Words: 177
