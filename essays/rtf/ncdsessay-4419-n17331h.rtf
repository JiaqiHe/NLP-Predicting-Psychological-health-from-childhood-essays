When I am 25 I will be working as a school teacher in class 1 or two. I will not get married until I am 27 or 28 years old. In my spare time I will be teaching how to play the piano or I will be reading books. If I do not qualify as a teacher I will open a hairdresser or a boutique. I will design dresses for women and children and I may try and get some fashions for the men in my spare time. I f I get married when I am 25 years old I think I will marry an archcoligist. I will have two children one girl and one boy. I will call the boy (name) and the girl (name). When (name) and (name) are about 12 or 13 I will make the clothes to fit them so that they can model the girls and the boys, if they model the clothes I will just have to get some women and some men to model the clothes that I have designed.
as a hairdresser I will make up my own styles. If I collect enough of the hair that I cut off of the customers I could make some wigs and I could sell them.  Words: 210
