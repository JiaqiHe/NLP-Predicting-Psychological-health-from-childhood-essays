----------------------
I will probably be going to or am at Canada. I hope to be a surgeon and carry out all sorts of operations, successfully I hope. I will have a flat in Calgary where my brother is living at the moment and have a small car. I will probably get married in Canada and I hope my wife can get a job to help the constant money problem. In my first few months I will visit relatives and friends all over Canada as my mother was born in Canada and is a Canadian citizen. I have no spare time because of all the patients I have. I drink alot and have the odd CIgarette now and then.  Words: 117
