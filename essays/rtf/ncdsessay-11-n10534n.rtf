My age is 25 and I am working as a nurse. When I left school I studied First Aid. Then I became interested to be a nurse. I am married now and have a 'happy home'. I have got a little girl and she says that when she grows up she wants to be a nurse like I am. I am not only a happy wife with a good job but I am a hard working housewife. Sometimes I go to visit my parents, and do shopping. My husband is also a hard worker. My job is quite nice as a nurse. In the summer we go on holidays. I enjoy the age of twenty-five. I have lots of friends and most of them are a nurse and they work with me. They have been my friends since I first started school and I have known them for years. We all get along well together. I have nice neghbours whom are very friendly.  Words: 163
