I have got a job of being a carpenter, and a part time job in the theartre as a musician I play the violin and some times the piano. I have been having driving lesson's and have got on very well, I passed my driving test successfully a few weeks ago , I now have bought my self a car and I am using it quite a lot, it is quite difficult to drive as it is new. I am still living with my parents, but saving up to buy a house and for when I get married. I have planned the marrage to be in three years time. At the moment I am looking round, for a house that is some thing like the kind I would like to buy, so I don't have any trouble when the time comes. At the moment I like a house that I have seen up in [county], but it is along way to travel to see my parents. Four years ago I finished a three year training course at [university]. I studied English, Speech and Drama. When I am married and I have settled down in my new house I am going to be a chemist (Pharmacist) and work as an actor in the theatre. In my spare time at the moment, I read, write compositions, draw and paint, help at home, do our garden, look after my car and sometimes rest.  Words: 240
