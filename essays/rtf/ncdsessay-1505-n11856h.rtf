I am 25 now I left school when I was 16 I decided to work as an railway engineer, at first I was only an apprentic. It is very exciting work all the big and small Deisels have to be fitted with parts or to be made. At home I have had very big intrest in train, I have got a big layout with 7 trains and I study the movements. It can not work at the moment for it is going to be extend. Sometimes we work night duty which is very tiring but it is good fun but hard work. When we are an* have I spend my time fishing, it is very good to pass the time away. Were I go it is very good you catch Perch Pike Salmon and trout. Then it is back to work again.  Words: 142
