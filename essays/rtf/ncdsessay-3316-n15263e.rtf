----------------------
I work on B.R. I am an engine driver and I drive trains from Paddington to Cheltenham. I work 9 hrs a day and get xxxx25 a week. I have a home of my own and traveling costs me nothing. I live on my own and I have enough money to keep me alive and buy nessesary things for myself. I go to visit my parents every weekend and any time I have off. I have a car which I do not use very often because British Rail supply my transport free. I wanted to be a trian driver because I wanted to see places and also trains. In my spare time I go and see a football match or a rugby match which is just as exiting or sometimes I go and see the boys down the shcool practising for their seven-a-side tournament. My younger brothr is married already and my sister is engaged to a good looking fellow of about 27 years old. They are both living happily they also have enough money for themselves. Last year we organised a run for charity and we got xxxx470 for the hospitals in Cheltenham. My mother and father were very pleased when I told them how much I had collected. My grandmother died and not soon after my grandfather died.  Words: 220
