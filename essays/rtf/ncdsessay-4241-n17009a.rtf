When i am 25 years old I expected I will have some boy friends. I shall also try for a driving licence and by that time I hope to have a little car of my own. So that i can get to places, because I shall not be able to relie on my parents. Also I hope I shall belong to a athettic club because I am quite interested in sports. Every since I was young I have wonted to be a chroperdist so I hope by that time I shall have passed my exams and have got a job. I might not be living with my parents I might be living where I have always won'ted to live all my live in a cottage in the country, living with me would be one pony, three dog a boser, great dane and a saint Bernard. I might even try to breed a few puppys. Perphaps if I get lonly in the country I might ask a friend to live with me. The pony would be called (name).  Words: 177
