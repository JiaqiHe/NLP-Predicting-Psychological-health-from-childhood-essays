My name is [female name] [surname]. I am writing to tell you about my work, which, I think, is very interesting. I am a writer, and though that may sound dull it is not. Rabbits are my subject and I study them, draw them, and photograph them as well as writing about them. I sometimes go from country to country to study the different breeds. My books have been a success, and much more painting was, which I tried before. I first had an interes in rabbit at six years old when I had a New Zealand White. I turned to my grandad for a name and he suggested Petunia. I have been extra fond of New Zealand Whites. Now I am in Holland, studying the Dutch after leaving college and studying the English wild rabbit for two years and the angora (whome I am not very fond of) for one. The Dutch is the smallest and timidest yet, and therefor I have to be well hidden away to study and photograph it in its nateral form. in two days I will be going to New Zealand but I shall not stay there long before going to America for a year of rest, less studying, and more writing.
Here, in Holland I am hand-rearing a baby Dutch rabbit and watching the difference between her and a certain baby wild one  Words: 229
