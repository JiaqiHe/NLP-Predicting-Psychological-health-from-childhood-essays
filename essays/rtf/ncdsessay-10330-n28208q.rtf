At the moment I have just gone round the wards of the [hospital] as I am in my last year of training to be a doctor. Yesterday I saw the drug cupboard and I was told the names of the drugs. I was twenty-five years old two months ago, and I have already been given a complete doctors' set.
      It is great fun training here at the [hospital] as I see how the patients come along each day. Some of whom I am aloud to whatch having their opperations done. I have decided to be a surgeon but I have got to train as a doctor first. I have got seven more months till I am a fully trained doctor and when I have finished training I will about a years doctoring and then come back and train to be a surgeon.
      My intrests are sport of all kinds, reading, judo and karaty. When I get home I read books and do some exercises, and, as I am not married, I have to cook for myself. I borrow books on famous doctors from the local library and I should think that I have read all the books on doctors they've got in the library!
      At school I got a scholaship to [college] and from there I came to the [hospital]. where I hope to work from now on. Today matron said that I could treet some patients.  Words: 237
