When I am 25 years old I hoped to be married and hope to have a child and I would like to be a vet because I am fond of animals. I want to travel to countryies and study other animals and from time to time go home and see my famliy after I have seltled in I will ask my family to come and live with me after they have come I shall vist some other country after a year or lo I shall become a house wife and Just own a little small shop where I can see to animals in my spare time I shall make clothes for my child and husband soon my child would be gettiny stronger and wanting to go places after so long I think I'd want to setlle down with my famly I would lead a normal life in the home And I would like to live in a quate little cottage in the country far from all noise I would go sailing and swimming now I think I would go back to be a vet and stick to it what I have learned I can pass ls my child I would start to dance and be great.
