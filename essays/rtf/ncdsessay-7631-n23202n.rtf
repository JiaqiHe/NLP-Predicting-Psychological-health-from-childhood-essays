I would like to be well off and not have to go out and earn my living like my mum I would like a toy poodle for myslef and a cat for my children. I would like my husband to be handy around the house. the children would have lots of toys they would be a girl and boy. I would like to have a three bedroom house a nice distrect and good neighbours. When my children got older and where out to school I would like to go out to work in a shop I would not put my children in a nursery unless I new that they would be treated nice and not left to Stay in the pram asleep all the time. My husband would make things for the house toys and games for the children. He would not be lasey and not go out to work because I would not feed him untill he did go to work. I would not spoil my children and I would not give one something without the other. I would give big partys when it was my children's birthday and my husbands and any other special occasions. My house would be tidy I would have a spare room if I had any more children or invite my brother's or sister up for the weekend other wise they would use it as a play room my children would go to a good school I would see my mum and dad every other week.
