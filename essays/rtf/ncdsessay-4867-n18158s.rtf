I am in the merchant navy , I have visited country's such as Africa, America, (Austria) Australia, Europe and Italy . I am interested in collecting Arab knifes, daggers and masks from Africa and also boomarangs from Australia . When I come home I am always greeted by my parents , but life at home is usualy dull. When I have to leave for my ship I am sorry to go not because I like home , but because of my parents. I think they are sad to see me go as well . My work is quite exciting sometimes when we dock. I wander round looking for things to by. I bought a large doll for my young sister, and a large sword for my older brother . I did not know what to buy my mother untill I saw a beauti** pesian rug . I quickly bought it and took it back to the shop. Now there was only one person I had to buy a present for, my dad, I bought him a dagger with false diamonds on the handle .I hoped the they would appreciate these presents , in other words I knew they would. The ship left port an hour later and we were soon on our way home , for this was only a short trip.  Words: 222
