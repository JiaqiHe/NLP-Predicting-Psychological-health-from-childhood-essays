My name is [First name Surname]. I am 25 years old. I have been married for 5 years and I have a daughter and a son. My daughter is 4 and my son is 2. My husband is 29 and he is Director of a Building Trade. I do not go out to work because there is no one to look after the children. Every dinner time I cook a meal for my husband. We live in a tiny cottage at Cobham. We are still paying off for the cottage. I enjoy going to Horse Riding at [xxxxxxx]. I have been going riding since I was 10. Last year we went on holiday at a farm. This year we are going on holiday at a hotel in [xxxxxxx] (a little village outside [xxxxxxx], [xxxxxxx]). We like [xxxxxxx] because the beaches are very clean and it is safe for young children. On the beach there is a Swimming Pool made from rocks and when the tide comes in it refills the pool. Sometimes an odd crab is seen on the bottom. At the cottage there are two bedrooms, a big kitchen, a louge, a dining room, a bathroom and a toilet. We have a telephone and a colour television. We are quite well off really.  Words: 214
