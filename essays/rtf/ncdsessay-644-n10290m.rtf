All the time i'm tranning im thinking is ill go to everton for the xxxx135000 transfer. or stay with leeds untill i reture. At about 3.o, clock i say to my self thats a full days work done. But before i go Don Revie wants to no is i want to go to everton and my answer is no, i want to stop with Leeds.
Even thow i am a footballer i am intrested in tennis, horse raceing and running. My wife dosent want me to go to everton and im glad she dosent.
