I was standing at the sink peeling potatoes when I thought about my married life. I am now 25 years old, I have 1 child, and I have houswork and cleaning up to do. Usually the baby wakes up in the morning around 7, o'clock. By 8 o'clock he's dressed, had breakfast and is sitting in his pram. I start with the washing on a Monday, and by lunch time, the clothes are hanging out on the line. I start making the dinner, egg, bacon and sausage, and while I'm waiting for my husband, [name], to come home, I feed the baby. When lunch is over and [name]'s back at work, the baby and I go down to the library. I look around for exciting books, and by the time I've chosen 3 or 4, its neary tea-time. I take the baby home, give him his tea, and rock him to sleep. Then I prepare dinner for two, open a tin of carrots, peas and butter beans, open a packet of Smash. While I'm waiting for the dinner I read one of my librarys. When the dinner is made and [name] comes in, we both sit down and talk about today. And what's been happening. After tea I get ready to go to a coffee evening held by one of my friends. We talk about our life, our family, and our work. Sometimes we watch Television. When its time to go we all thank the friend and return home. I arrive home about 10.30 pm and have a small supper. Then I go to bed.  Words: 265
