----------------------
My life is a pleasant one. I have no children and I am not married. My job is an apprentice in a steel company. The house which I live in is a little cottage up in the Yorkshire dales. 
My main interest is boates. When I have enough materials I build motor yachts and other remote controlled boats. The place that I sail them on is a pond just across the road from my house. Sometimes but not often I go rock climbing or pot-holing with my freinds. Already we have discovered about seven to twelve caves in the Yorkshire Dales around the place which I live in. 
To get to work takes me about 3 hours. The car which I have is a little old wan* that is quite strong. Sometimes I go fishing in the lake district for a week or two. The animals which live in my back garden are mainly rabbits or moles.
My mother and father live in a town called [town]. My brother and sister are still living with them. My cottage is the highest up in the village. This year my freind and I are having a holiday in Scotland. I have not yet been to London but I am intending to go next year for my holidays. In the village there is a ferry from morning till night from one side of the lake to the other side. The only other country I have everr been to is Wales when I was eight years old. In the steel company I work with there are also quite a few other apprentices.  Words: 267
