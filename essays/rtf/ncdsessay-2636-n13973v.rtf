When I am 25 years old I will buy a house in [town]. It will have a garden with it and a pond in the middle of it. I will keep the house clean and tidy. I will be interested in my work as a typist. I will go to work every day and be intersted in my work. I will buy a car and go out when it is possible. I will have a garage next to the garden. When I am 25 I will work hard for my living and I will save money up and put it in the bank. I will work in a large office where they have heat, to keep warm in winter and cold days. I will type letters out every day and read letters that have been sent to the office and typists will have to write back to the people who sent them to the office, for messages.  Words: 157
