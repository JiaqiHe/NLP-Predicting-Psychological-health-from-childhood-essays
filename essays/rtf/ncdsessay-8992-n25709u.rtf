I am now 25 years old and in the navy and I am working the guns on a royal navy ship. I like it in the navy and have singed on for seven years, and if I do not like it after the seven years will come out, but I do like so I have singed on for full time we are now sailing to France. France is a long way so we have to take food with us. from France I would bring a presant my girl friend. When I get back from france we have an holiday I would as to my girl friend and give her the presant I bought her. When we had saved up anough money we would get married and buy an house. Then when it is time to go back to the navy. In the navy you get so much money each week I spend some of mine and I save some of it so that I when I get another holiday I will take home to my wife so that she can buy food. When I come out of the navy I will get another job.  Words: 194
