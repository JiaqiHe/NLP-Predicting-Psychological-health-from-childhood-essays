If I was 25 now, I would probably live in a small flat. I would go to work at 9 o'clock in the morning and finnish at 5 o'clock, I would make my own meals. After my tea I would go out in my car. When summer came round I would go away for a week say Paris or New York. My flat would have modern furniture in it. I would hold lots of parties and have beer, sausage on sticks, salad and Chinese food. I would like to own a pony and go for rides on it. I would like my job to be hairdressing. I would do my own hair. If I am a hairdresser I will meet lots of different people. I would have a dog for apet.  Words: 131
