I am a riding instructress I live with my parents I  have sixteen horses altogether. I have my own car and my own particular pony. On the coming saturday I will be go taking a group of riders to Meller on a day ride, it will cost thirty shillings altogether and as they either bring their own dinner or buy it at ****. When I am free during the week my friend and I go for long country rides and enjoy ourselves. We usually take our lunch with us when we decide to have our lunch we stop at a farm and ask if we could stop in the field to have our lunch, when we do have out lunch we take out ponies saddle and bridle off rub them down then let them graze* for a while, while we *at out lunch when we finish out lunch we go for a little strole while the ponies are still grazing when we come back we call out ponies we take out carrots out of out pockets and give them to our ponies, we then put their saddle and bridle back on but we did not put the girth* to the proper length it should have been tighter but we were going to give them a drinck* when they had finished drinking we tightend the girth and we set off back home to do some more work.
