I am twenty five years old, I have a dog called Rebel, he is brown and white, also I have a hamster named Timmy. My birthday was one week ago. I bought my hamster with some of my birthday money. The Farm I live in is called Cherry trees Farm. I have a lot of different coins from other countries. There is a little stream near our farm and it is spring water. I go swimming every week. When it snows it is usually deep round the Farm. I live in the country and there are not many shops or houses.  Words: 101
