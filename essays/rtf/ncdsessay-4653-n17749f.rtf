Two years ago I joind the Navy as a T.G.M. in the supmarine HMS Storm. A few months ago I was picked for the Navy cricket team*. My fovarit sports are still cricket, swimming ruger, and bamminton. Next week we are goiing on a short partrol in the Atlantic. We have to get food suplies, and more disel oil from the dept ship HMS Ford. The periscope also has to be remx renewed because on our last patrol it flooded. I am now on* a five day leave and I am staying at the Hotel Swiss in the next town from were Storm is berthed. I enjoy live in the Navy because it is exciting and active. My parents will be in Spain on holiday by now, and I almost wished that I had gone with them, because it was still cold even though it was summer. I am hoping to play some baminton some time with the ERA, and number one.  Words: 162
