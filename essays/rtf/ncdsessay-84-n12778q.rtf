I am leading a nice life as a cook and at home breading birds. I am a cook at a school dinners. When I come home in the after noons I would do the house work and then go and see to the birds. The birds I would bread would be canaries. On Friday nights I would like go dancing. The dancing would be ballroom or folk dancing. At the age of 25 I want to have a child. I enjoy being a cook and it is interesting talking about what the children were doing in school I would like my child (or children) to be able to swim as it saves many lives. I would like to live in one of these counties England or New Zealand or Australia.  Words: 130
