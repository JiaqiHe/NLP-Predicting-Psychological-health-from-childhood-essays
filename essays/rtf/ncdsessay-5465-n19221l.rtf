I am 25 years old I am married and have found a home to live in. I am not going to work yet, instead, I am staying at home to do the house-work while my husband goes to work. Later on I am going to look For a part time job preferably in a shop of some sort. I use my spare time For my hobbies, my hobbies are cooking, gardening and painting, and I have a bookcase Full of books For reading. The books I read are adventure, science, gardening, nature, cookery and information books that improve my general knowledge. Later on I may have children and look after them and bring them up properly and then send them to school when they are old enough. I have not started smoking and I never will. Now I have children I cannot go to work or do my hobbies because I have no time with so much house-work to do. Instead of smoking I save my money for better things like clothes, Food, and educational things for the children. When the children are grown up I will have more time to do my hobbies, but I expect they will be different ones than the ones before. Then when I am 48 years old I will lead a quiet, normal life with my husband.  Words: 223
