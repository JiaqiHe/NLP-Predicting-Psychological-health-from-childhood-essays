I am not married but I am engaged. I live up in the lake District, at [location] looking down to lake Windowmere. I have eight penns, holding a hundred sheep each. The walls are white washed, my sitting room is looking straight down to lake Windowmere. I employ eight shepherds who live in a converted cowshed. Each man has a bed in a room by themselves, they have xxxx10 a week pay. They eat with me in the kitchen and I give them a packed lunch which is usually some sandwiches and cake. I myself go round checking the sheep. When it comes to sheering the sheep I emlpoy an expert from the village. I do some sheering but not as much as the villager does when we have finished a lorry from Lancaster comes to take it to the mills to weave it.
In my spare time I sail from a little jetty at the bottom of the field. I have friend at the neighbouring farm who I often invite for dinner. In the holidays I often have* my nephews down. I camp and sail with them and swim sometimes. Last summer I bought them their own sailing dinghy. We often have raes up and down the lake.  Words: 208
