My job is to please other people as I have decided on bieng a newspaper reporter. I am a reporter that travels all over the world reporting about diasaters, and sometimes I get a story on the front page. I hardly ever get a chance to write about anything else My life is very interesting as I can sometimes be caught in the story I am writing. I took up the job as a reporter because I wanted to travel and see things Apart from reporting I have other intrests as well. I sometimes play for a club in the ametur class, or else I take up a good book and read it. Bieng a reporter isi'nt easy as I had to pass many degrees in English. Taking up reporting made me intrested in Shakespear and I have a bookcase full off his books and plays I got so intrested that I played a part in one of his plays While still at College. I don't get much time at home so it is a good thing I am not married, instead I live in a flat on my own. I do smoke a pipe and also drink. I am keeping up a car which is an mini. Before taking up reporting I was quite interested in Art. The life I lead is a dangerous but great one the wage is a good sum of money. When I have reported and got my notes I rush back to the office and get the story finished If it is a good enough story for the front page then I would get a bonus.  Words: 272
