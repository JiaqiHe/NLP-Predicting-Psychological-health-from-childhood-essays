I Am 25 years old, my name is **ella Warne. i am not married I enjoy my life as a swimming instructer. about 30 schools come swimming every day. I take about 10 of them. In my spare time I clean my flat. or go to the sea. in the evning i sometimes stay at home or go to the night club. It is a very peacfull town called [town] not many people live in margate. I have lived there nearly all my life so I know nearly every body who lives there. To get to the sea all I have to do is walk across the road. I often walk to west-gate along the shore as it is only 2 miles away. As I am a part time swimming instruter I have a lot of spare time in it I haved saved many people who went swimming on a rufgh day. and nearly all of them became freinds and they nearly all have settled down in [town]. in the winter when the pool is closed. so I work at the hospital from 9pm to 5 am. at the hospital I am a nurse. my intrests are looking after hurt animals, study nature. and riding.
