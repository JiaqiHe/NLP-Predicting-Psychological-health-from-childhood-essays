I am learning to be a vet and I help Mr [surname]. Sometimes we have to be up at about 1 o'clock in the morning tending to animals that have been injured. It is a very hard job and it is not often that you get much cleep. It is so sad when animals die and cannot be saved. There are always a great many dead and injured animals, ill and sick. Once we had to go and see a cat which had cat flew and Mr. [surname] told me that it was one of the worst diseases that a cat could have.
Sometimes we have to go and see cows or sheep with pnemonia or horses with diseases or sometimes dogs which have had a heart attack.
I soon learned that there were lots of illnesses and diseases that animals could get. He taught me how to give them injections and what kind to give them. He taught me how to lamb ewes or calve cows, how to operate and do various other things that might be needed.
He showed me how to dose sheep and what pills or medicines to give them.  Words: 191
