----------------------
My life is very enjoyable. I work as a vet and I keep horses and dogs for other people in the country.
When I am on holiday I stay with my mother and father in the town which I very much like for its clubs and the sea where I love bathing, but when I am in my mother and father's home I best of all like to cook the tasty food in my mother's cookery books.
My other outside interests are camping in the woods and country running with my friends on the downs as a race.
I also read a lot and act in the cinama where I ern a tot of money.
I live in the country, in a neat little cottage withe a thatched roof and small windows and also have an acre of garden and a very old airracle shelter at the bottom of it. I like garding and I grow many vegetables and flowers.
My pet animals are a few chickens, rabbits and turkeys
One side of my house I have ill animals and the other side helthy ones. Sometimes when people don't wont there animals I put them in a home nearby where they are exercised and are very happy.  Words: 201
