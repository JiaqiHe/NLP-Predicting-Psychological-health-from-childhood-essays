If I was 25 years old I would probably be working on a Job I would like to take on a Job of making things out of clay or work with wood because I like working with wood a lot, when my father comes home from work he brings wood to work with and sometimes theres some wood left over and we take it and see what we can do with it when we have any spare time and working with wood now might help me to work when I Grow up but even if I dont become a carpenter I can always find another Job.
