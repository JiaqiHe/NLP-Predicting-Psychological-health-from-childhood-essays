I work as apartime nurse. I work in the Morning to 1 o'clock. in the afternoon. I go out at night to see my mother and father. I have a house of my own, I live a plesant life. After I have been to see my family I go straight home, and put the kettle on and start making the tea, for when my husband comes home. When he comes home I will usely have his tea on the table. If at night I have to go back to the hospital to stay in the ward, while the other nurse goes home for tea, my husband might go to the Public bar to have a drink. In the morning I have to do a quick breakfast for my husand and I, before we go to work, in the afternoon, I clean the house up so if I have to rush down to the hospital. On saturday night my husband usely takes me to the cinmea. At night, my husand usely has a meal of fish and chips or steak and kidney pie. My husband does not come home at dinner time because I usely come home a bit late. In the hospittal I look after babies. I like being a nurse, and wish I could go across to* other countries.
