I am twenty five years old. I work with horses at a riding stable near [town]. The thing I like doing best in my job is feeding the horses and riding them. I have a horse of my own and his name is falla. I have a sports car of my own but I don't go out in it very often. I uselly let my mother borrow it. When I left I went to work strait away. I am not married or engaged. I live with my mother and father in a bungalow next to the riding stables. I am very happy living at home. I don't work Sundays but I do the other six days of the week. My father own's the riding stable so I can keep falla there. Falla is a show jumper. My mother does not work at the riding stable but father does. My interests are riding, swimming and drawing. In my spare time my friend the girl I work with, and my self sometimes go to the swimming baths which is two streets away from were I live. At the deep end it is 18 foot deep and at the shallow end it is 3 foot deep. I enjoy swimming but I only get the chance to go on a night*. On a sunday if it is fine my mother, father and I usally go to my mum's sisters She lives at [town], her name is [name]. She has a son 29 years old.  Words: 250
