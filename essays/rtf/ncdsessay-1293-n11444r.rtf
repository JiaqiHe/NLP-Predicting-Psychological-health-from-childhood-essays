As my brother is a steward in B.E.A.. I hope by the time I am 25 I migth be a Air-Hostess of the same company, I would like to learn all the languages in the world like, Spanish, Frence ect, Before I would Join the B.E.A I would try and get married, and if I do I would still like to be a air-Hostess. I would fly at night and sometimes in the day, we usally have two days off, and then go back on the flight to different places like Malta, and Sweden, and Amsterdam, and in the spear time, between the flight I would look around the hotel and garden, and the Docks ect. I would have a few drinks. before I go back on the flight. When I go back to England I would leave out of the house that I live in now and if I had enough money I would buy a new house and look after my child until on flight again and then I would let my husband look after her and feed her. If I had time at home I would like to join the tennis club, because I am very keen on tennis. Or Him.  Words: 204
