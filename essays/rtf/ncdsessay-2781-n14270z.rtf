My home is a little cottage it has four rooms . Two of them are bedrooms and the others are a living room and a kitchen. The curtains have flowers on them. I drive a car it is a sports car and it is blue with a black hood. When I took driving lessons I was very nervous. Once I crashed into a lampost but I escaped just in time. at home I do all the houswork and cooking. at night I watch the telivision I am interested in animals. I have a red setter he is 3 years old. I had a red setter when I was younger.
I like going to the zoo to see all the animals. The squirrels are cute with their fluffy tails. I do not wear mini skirts or maxi skirts because I do not like them. The fancy ones are nice .  Words: 184
