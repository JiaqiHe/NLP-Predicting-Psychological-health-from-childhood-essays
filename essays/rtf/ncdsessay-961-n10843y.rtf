When I leave coledge I am going to train to be a school teacher I think being a teacher would be a very useful job. It must be good (fun) to look after children and tell them what to do and learn them what you and myself have been taught already.
If I do not pass to be a teather I think an Art-Detect would be a good job. I like drawing so if I try hard anough I will be able to pass for that.  Words: 85
