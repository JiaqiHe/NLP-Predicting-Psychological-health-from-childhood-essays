I am now 25 years old, and I live in a big house in the country. I look after animals that are not very well, and when there are holidays, people come and leave their pets and I look after them. I have 8 people who come and help me. Every morning I get up 5.30. First of all I feed the dogs. Sometimes we have as many as 30 or 40 dogs to feed, clean and look after. We don't have as many cats. I look after cats, dogs, birds, mice, fish, hens, rabbits and guinea pigs, etc . As I live in the country a lot of people own horses, we keep them in the stables. At about 7.30. all the animals are fed and cleaned. My helpers take the dogs out for a walk, while I stay behind and do odd jobs. By 6. O'clock in the evening I am tirred out, and about that time I have my tea . I like reading, and I go to the big library once a week in the nearest big town 30 miles away. I listen to the wine**ss, and watch the television mostly in the winter, because we don't have as many animals to look after. Igo to town twice a week to get food supplies. Every Saturday and Sunday we have riding lessons, and when it is fine, quite a number of people come to ride. Icharge 7/6d I own ten horses, 4 cats, 3 dogs, and 2 rabbits. Ialso have a tortoise. I enjoy my work very much .  Words: 263
