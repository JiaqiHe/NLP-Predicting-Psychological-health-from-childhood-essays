I am leading a life that isn't excellent but it isn't excellent but it isn't dull its just right for me in my life time I have done interesting things I've been dealing with horses most of the time. I am not bothering with boys at the moment like most girl do I am more interested in making up poems and writing story and stamp collecting and horse riding my life ahead of me I want to be peaceful and to keep it to my self. Instead of the whole world knowing. Now I am going to given my part time job I will start of full time job for about 8 or 9 year till I'm about 39 then I will then work in the mornings till when I am about 45 then I will carrion with my horses and stamps when I am very old I can look back on my lifetime of all the things I've done and I will read* back on my dairy. Then I will get old and feeble and get an illness or something I will most probley die. But before I do I will enjoy my life as much as I can. I don't intend have children of my own I am going to adobted some but I know now I am not going to have more than four. I hope there name will reasonable but I will choose them later on. But now they have dug my grave ready for me and my soul has lefted me.  Words: 256
