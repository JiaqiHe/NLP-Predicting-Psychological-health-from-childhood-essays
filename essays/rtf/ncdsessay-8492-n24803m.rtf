At the age of 25 I would like to travvel around for sometime before I get an actual permanet job. I would like to train to be a helicopter pilot after this. I would like to join the Air sea rescue down at the helecoptor base near Helston in Cornwall. I would like to join the one in Cornwall because It is my favourite place where I go for my holidays. I would like to stay in it for ten years. After that would go and train to be a pilot of an airtliner. I would first be a co-pilot and after a few year I would become the captain. At the age of 40 I would become a racing driver for the rest of my life. I would like to be a racing driver because I like travvelling at great speeds. I would either drive eny ordanary racing car or drive a dragster. A dragster is like a racing car only it has no top. The engine is just in front of the drivers cockpit. A dragster has small wheels at the front and very big wheels at the back. It has very big wheels at the back because it goes so fast that the wheels burn and by the time it has finished the back weels a* burnt down. After that I would like to spend the last day of my life glider flying.  Words: 236
