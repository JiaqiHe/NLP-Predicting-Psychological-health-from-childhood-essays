When I was younger I wanted to become a soildier and live like my father but I became an engineer for the army, it is a very hard job but I get paid well. My house is a bungarlow in [town] it took me a long time to find a job and the house. It is well decorated better* than a lot of other people's houses.
In my spare time I play golf with friends but in the evening I go to the pub and drink, play cards, and darts. I have to go to work at eight o'clock*. An army engineer has a hard time because* lorries and land-Rovers brake down and* get punsher's a lot of times, more than* ordanery cars because they go over a* lot of rough grownd. I sometimes have* two go away on long journies up* to Scotland and places like that, it is a* hard time it my job. I once went to* Bornieo, that was the longest journy ever*. I would not do it again because I* did not have time off, and for nine mounths* we lived on curry and rice and* it was boiling hot when I came home* my children did not reconize me. After that I did not go away again and I did not that is what I do and have done for eight years.  Words: 227
