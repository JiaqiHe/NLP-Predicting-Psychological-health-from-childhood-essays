I am working for 8* as an air hostess. I have travelled to many countries. To iceland, Norway, Sweden, finland, denmark france, Italy, Australia.
      I have had two other jobs. One was at a Stables and the other as a Shop assistant. I am married to Goergie Best. I don't see much of him though.
      I meet alot of people in my job. I've met the president of the U.S.A. and president De gaule I've also met the Royal family. 
      I had to go through alot of training before I became an air hostess. we used to have a lot of parties.
      I get a lot of free journeys. I have to cook all the passengers meals which is bit of a trial.
      I enjoy swimming and going to parties. I own Some Stables my friend keeps her horse at my Stables.
      A few days ago Georgie and I went out to buy a new coffee table and Coffee Set. The table was made of glass inside it; it had tropical fish swimming around in it.  Words: 177
