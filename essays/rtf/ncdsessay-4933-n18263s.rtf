What a day i'VE had just come back from training with the football team. Oh! in case you don`t know I play goalkeeper for (team). When I finished training I had to dash back to my Boutique Because I had a load of orders to send out today.
at 5. 30 I packed  up Because I had to get ready for a dance tonight 
mind you we couldn`t stay out too long I had a match tomorrow. Off I dashed in my car to my little house just outside (place), at once I got all ready to go out tonight, I had just enough time before I went out, to do a bit of Bird watching which is my favourite hobby. at eight o` clock I called around at (name) house a girl I know and off we went to the dance. I had a great time at the dance with (name) all my favourite songs came on. at 11 o` clock I took (name) home and then went home myself I had a tough game coming up against the (team). I was up at half past seven and by 9.30 I was in the (place). ten minutes from the end of the match I had to go off on a stretcher I had collided in the air with another player, the following week I was not in the team Because of my injury well thats life I suppose.
