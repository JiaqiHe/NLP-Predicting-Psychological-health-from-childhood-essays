When I am 25, I might have some children, if I have I will take them out so they will not get bored I might take them to see their nan and grandad, or I might take them out for a walk in the country. My husband might be tall or shoret his hair might be dark or fairm and his eyes night be blue, green or brone He might be good to me or he might be bad to me. I would like to live in a small house in Jilbury with beautiful gflowers in the gardon and it would be lovely if we had pink, red and yellow flowers. Oh by the way I would call my baby if it was a boy *rorer and if I had a girl I might call her legsor*. I might think of another name for I have got a long way to go yet befor I have a baby of my own, I might not have one yet.  Words: 167
