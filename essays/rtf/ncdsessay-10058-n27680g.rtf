I am 25 yrs of age now, and when I was 18 I started training as a nurse. A few weeks ago, I passed my exam to be a quallified nurse, and I am working in a London Hospital. I enjoy my work, and like helping people who are ill in hospital.
Last week we had an emergency patient in, who had a hemorage in his brain. He was given an emergacy opeation and luckily he is still living. When he was brought in after colapsing at the airport, he was still unconcious after 24 hrs. I was put in charge of him, and I enjoy helping this patient to become well again very much. 
Yesterday I became engaged to a man, who I have been going steady, with for a long time. The wedding is to take place in six monthis time. My wedding dress is going to be made out of white satain, with a long flowing train (not forgetting the veil). I will not leave my job as a nurse when I am wedded, because I like my job too much.
Heart transplants are a much more usual thing than when I was a child, and nearly always the patients live. I know a woman, who had a heart transplant (because of a heart attack) and she is still alive, and kicking. When I was doing my training their was a child of ten in the childrens ward who had a heart transplant, and is still living. 
Every Saturday mornings (when I am off work) I usually go to the ice skating rink in Richmond, to  Words: 267
