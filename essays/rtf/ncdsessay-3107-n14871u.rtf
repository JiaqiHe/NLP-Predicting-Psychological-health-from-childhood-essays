I am 25 years old now, I am very different from when I was a child. When I was a child I was very short and then now I am 6 ft and stout I have brown eyes and brown hair. I lived in [city] when I was young but at the age of 21 I emagrated to Austrailia.
      I have a nice bugallow in [road] in Sydeny. We have two bedrooms one for my wife and I and one for the baby who is four months old. We have two bathrooms one upstairs and the other downstairs We have also a lounge and a kitchen and a dining room which are situated at the back off the bungallow. In the lounge we have a sideboard, a set of three chairs, and a soffa. 
I work in one of the biggest Industries in Austrailia gold mining. Before you can become a miner you have to pass certain tests. First you get coverd in black paint to see haugh much dirt you can withstand. Then you ar e slid on sort of a stretcher in to a round container and it is heated and cooled to see how much heat and cold you can withstand. As well as being a miner I am a pretty good shot with a gun. Nearby ther is a estate which is deserted the council have made it into a game resort, there are wild deer and boare roaming around the estate. I go there every weekendd. I have got my own gun. I haave killed 7 dear and 3 boare and the clubs only been open 3 or 4 months.
      Its a wonder full life in Austrailia.  Words: 282
