With my pay I would give it to my mother. I would also like to play goolf* and* football when I am old enough. My interests are football (***) cricket a joiner I would, like these jobs because I like working with wood playing with a ball and run*ning for cricket. When I am at home I would watch the television play with my children because I would like to get married. I would also put a bit on the horses because I like watching horses run. I would also like to have a car then I could take the family out far a ride into the country. I would visit my mother as often as I could that would be about ones or twice a week. I would like to have a house in the country and I would also like to have a farm with lots of animals in it. Like pigs, cow, hens and lots more animals. I would not like a bungalow because they would be to small. On the farm I would have tractor and some more things.  Words: 224
