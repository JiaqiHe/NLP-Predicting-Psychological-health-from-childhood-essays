At work it will be awful because you are now 25 every-body will patting you on the sholder and saying happy birthday. They are all interested in what you get and you have to tell them over and over again. I will be glad when work is fiinished. But this morning it was not so bad at home because hardly any one was up. In the post I got 22 cards from my family and friends. A big bow-cay came from ten girls this morning. Oh well here goes into work I go. But what a shock I got nobody was here so I just sat down in my chair then from some where came a song I knew straight away who it was it was my friends they all held a party for me and nobody did a stroke of work. and I got more cards and more presants and every thing went well so it was not bad at all.
