I am 25 years old and just finishing a five year course as a Doctor at university. At the beginning of my course it was very uninteresting but as time went on it gets very much more interesting. The university is St Andrews, and I have lived here all the time I have been studying. In my spare time I have plenty of pass-times, first of all I go golfing but because it takes a long time I am not able to get there very often. Also there is a public library where I get books for both my work and my spare time, so I have plenty to read. In the mornings I get up very early so that I am at university in time. When I get home in the evenings usually at 5 or 6 O'clock. I have my tea and then I go for a walk. Afterwards when I get back to the flat I usually study till 9 O'clock. For the rest of the evening I just sit by the fire and read a book until it is time for bed. On Saturdays I go playing gold or down to the sea then I stay up very late but I always stay in bed till mid-day on Sunday. My holidays are not very long but long enough to go home for a visit to my family.  Words: 231
