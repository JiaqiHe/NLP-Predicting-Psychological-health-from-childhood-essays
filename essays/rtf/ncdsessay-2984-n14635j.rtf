I am leading a fairly good life and I am interested in stamps and from where they come from. Also I like drawing maps of far countries. I work at an iron factory in Sunderland. I do not smoke cigarettes or a pipe I go out with my freinds to a club. I would like to go on a world tour and see France, Germany, Austria, China, Japan, Austrailia and many other countries. I live in a house at [address]. I like to help injured birds and I like drawing birds. The birds I have already drawn is a peacock, pheasant, scarlet Macaus canary, chiff-chaff and a few animals. I make lots of things at the factory I make iron poles, pans, iron cups, and many more things. Best of all I like making things from wood I have already made a cupboard and a table and I am making a chair which is nearly finished. After I have finished the chair I am going to make a garden seat for at the bottom of the garden. It will be painted green to match the lawn. I have made a well with roses in it and a gnome sitting beside a pond. I have planted vegtables in the other garden.  Words: 210
