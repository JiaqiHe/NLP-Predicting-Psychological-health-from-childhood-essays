I wanted to be a footballer and play with [football club] The life would be hard. I would live in a flat and I would not get married. The life I would lead is interesting because I will be a footballer and I would score many goals and have pictures of [football club] and I would be a good footballer like [name]. The time I would have in a flat builting a pond and keeping wild birds. Coming from the holiday camp and having a good time.
