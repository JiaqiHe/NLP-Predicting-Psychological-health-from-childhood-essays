On my twenty fifth birthday I felt really grown up, and I had a wife and a nice house which I paid five thousand pounds for. A week I earn twenty three pounds and the house a week was eight pounds. My job is a printer in London, where I have to go every day, to get up there it cost me twelve shillings a day there and back, and a week it cost me *3 ** **. At weekends we usually go to Devon because it makes a difference than London, we usually come back on ,Sunday afternoon and go straight from work on Friday.
We have a car so we can get about a lot, but if you have'nt got a car you cant go really anywhere, well you can but it would cost you about twelve pounds there and back for both of you but if you went by car it costs about five pounds which saves you a lot of money well it does to us.
In Summer we are going to Majorca in Spain, it will make a difference from Devon, we are staying there for three weeks so from now on we are saving up and not going to Devon each week, but we will go for a ride in the car for a picnic probably or maybe go to my mothers sometimes, or we might just stay in and watch television but I think I'll do the garden this weekend it needs doing up I think I'll by some da**** they always make a nice show in the sumer. It is now a week from when we go to Spain no I must get ready and go and draw the money out of the bank. Now is a day to go so in the morning I must get up at five o clock get a taxi to drive us to the airport and if we go to Spain on holiday.  Words: 325
