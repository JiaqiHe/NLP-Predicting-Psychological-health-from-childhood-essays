I have Just finished my work for today and I am ready to go home. I have a car so it makes geting home much guicker than by taking* a bus oR walking home. I Still live with my parents beccuse I have'nt found a husband. yet. now I am home and I hope to go out tonight With my boyfreind if I am ready in Time. ring ring that must be my boyfreind now yes' it is. I like going out I like Staying in too because in my Spare time I like Sewing and making things, In the morning when I wake up at 6 o'clock I get up and I am off to work by 7.30. I work as a Securtary. In my dinner hour I often look at the shops if I have time, and Sometimes I buy things which I need for the Summer or partys and weddings. When My boss gives me Some time off I always hope that in a few weeks time I will get married because I would like to go to Austrailia  for my hunimoon. I have made clothes for if I have a baby and I make Some of my own clothes too when I come home from a Triing day at work. I go to my bed room and think what a happey life it will be for me when I get married and have children of my own.  Words: 241
