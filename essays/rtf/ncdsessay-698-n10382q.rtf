Iam a dentist and I like my job. When I go home just read books and newspapers, sometimes I go out to visit relations. I go to see the local football team play, I dont get much enjoyment because I have to work on a Saturday so therefore I cannot go to see the football and other enjoyments. My wife, (name) likes the house we live in and my two sons, (name)5 and (name)6 have got a lot of pals. My mother lives quite near us but she is quite lonely . My father died of a heart attack . I get tired looking down peoples throats but the thing like worst is taking peoples theeth out. Otherwise I like my job  Words: 122
