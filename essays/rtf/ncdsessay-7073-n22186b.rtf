I have just passed some O levels at [college] and this next year I hope to take my A levels and become a second or chief engineer on board a royal navy submarine. At the moment I havent got the money for a car and even if I had I wouldn't buy one as I am quiet content with the motor bike I've got. We have just had our summer holidays in which I with a colledge friend in his yaught went sailing on the Norfolk Broads. When on the broads we had some of the most thrilling experiences. I am amad keen football suporter and all though the colledge is in Plymouth last week I managed to see them play against Chelsea in which Manchester City the team I support happened to win by a lucky penalty two, one. The we are given to do at the colledge is by no means easy athough I can't say it's dreadfully hard and I manage to get through it moderatly well. At home I have a sister who is doing well at school and hopes to be an Air Hostess and so wants to go to University to study languages.  Words: 199
