"As I opened the door of my flat I noticed that my flat mate [name] was not in. She always left her things behind her and flung herself on the settee for a rest. I began to get the tea things out as it was nearly 5 o'clock. At work I had had my feet trodden on several times and so I changed into a pair of sandals. By the time I had eaten tea [name] was still not in. As I started to wash up the tea things I heard a key click in the lock. It was [name]. She said she had stopped and talked to the vicar about the youth club. I told [name] I was going to have a bath and that her tea things were an the table. When I was out the bath. I got dressed in my best dress and shoes. I was going out with [name] my boyfriend [name] was washing her things up when I came down into the kitchen. [name] said to me ""Going out again honestly thats the fourth time this week. Well I replied ""I go out alot dont I theres nothing wrong in that. [name] decided to rest the matter so I got my coat and went out to meet [name]. Meanwhile [name] was waiting for me at the cinema. The cinema is one of my favourite haunts. When I got there [name] started complaing bitterly. He said that I was always late. 
      In the morning I got the bus and started out for work. My job was a secretary to a man who worked for a firm called [company]. I was happy there and the people were very nice to me. I am a very cotented girl."  Words: 292
