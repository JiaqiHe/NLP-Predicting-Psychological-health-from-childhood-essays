I am now 25 years old and I have a husband of 27 and a child of 8 weeks. I am a fully trained nurse working in a large hospital. I live in a bungalow in the countryside where cows graze in the fields and birds sing in the morning dew. It is five o'clock in the morning and the baby is crying for her milk, well I suppose I'd better get up and make it, she is a terror. Now where did I put that can of milk 'oh' there it is. Now you monster here's your milk, you won't be satisfied till it's gone will you. Oh dear I'm very tired and it'll time for work soon so I might as well stay up. So in I went to the bathroom. Brrr it must be a very cold morning out so I'd better put my thick winter coat. I'll just run the hot tap dear me even the hot water gone cold 'oh' its getting warmer now. Oh no that baby just will not keep quiet and It's nearly time for work. O come on let's get you in your pram. Now I'll just put my coat on and off we go. It is cold to-day I was right and the roads are terribaly busy. 'Crash' my these kerbs are high they should have slopes on the kerbs. Are here we are at last. 'Hello [name] how are you?' 'Not to bad thank you'. 'O well I'll leave you with the baby then see you' 'bye'. 6 o'clock in the evening'. 'O dear what a day better go and see how [name]'s getting on with the baby'. 'What a life!'  Words: 282
