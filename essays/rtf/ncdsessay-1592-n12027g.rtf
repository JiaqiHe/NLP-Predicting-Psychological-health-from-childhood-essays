I sometimes work with a prencant freind who is [male name] [surname]. His lake is very wonderful I will be going to the Canary Islands. Which* is very beautiful and has a lot of birds. [male name] [surname] and I are taking film of some Huming birds which are rare in the jungle. My ambition is to write a book and have panitings at a art gallery. The best thing with a picture of a kiwi* is its colour. I sturdy the structure and quickness of a Heron which lives down the lake. I will soon be living with [male name] [surname]. There he will be teaching the arts of ornethology*. And I will be going on a tour to Brazil.  Words: 151
