My job is being a hairdresser which I enjoy very much and is very interesting. Ienjoy doing the house work and helping the children with their difficulties I hope to work in a play-group when I give up being a hairdresser. I have only two small children and I don't want any-more. one is small and the other is quite big. 1 girl and 1 boy. The boy called [male name] and the girl called [female name] I have a husband who has quite a good job and we have a detached house in London. I live near some of my relations. And my husband is near enough to some of his. The children go to a good school in London and are quite intelligent. Both children are good at English and Maths.  Words: 133
