It is now August 26th 1983 and I shall soon be 26. I am living in a town called [town]. I live with my husband and one daughter called [female name] she is one year two months. My Husband is a builder he is called [male name] [surname]. I am a house-wife.
We live in a bungalow with three bedrooms. My life is very busy now it is a lot different then when I was living with my mother. My Interests are a lot different as well. Since I have been married I have no spare time but there are lot more things now to make things easier than there were 15 years ago. [female name] takes up most of my time except when my mother looks after her and we can go out. My husband goes to work a 8 'oclock and comes home at 5.30 so if I did not have a daughter my life would be a lonely one. I have to get up early in the mornings and fairly late at night I have to give the baby all her meals and see to her I have to cook the meals make beds wash dishes but not we have an electric dish washer and clean the house and lots of other things so my home life is fairly busy. In the evenings I am usually knitting for my daughter.  Words: 232
