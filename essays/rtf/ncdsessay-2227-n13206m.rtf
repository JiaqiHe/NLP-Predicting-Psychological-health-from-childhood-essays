I am a mechanic and I am working on a racing car, because I want to be a racing driver i am making a lotus climex formula one. I am not yet married*. I do drank but not very much. The body-shell of the car is still at the factory I have had a lot of help by other mechanics. My hobby is swiming I go swimming every Saturday afternoon. At home I usually ha** a read and then watch the television. Every morning I get up early because I have got to get at work at the garage. In the evening I leave work a six 'o' clock and get home at about twenty past six. My friend usually drives me home because I have not yet got my car back from my dad. He is trying mine out to see if to buy one himself. Soon as my racing car is finished I will practice and practice to be a champion racing driver.  Words: 165
