At 25, I have just left [university]. I studied English and History and Law and I am going to [location] to become a barrister. I live in a small flat in [city]. At the university I got a blue for rowing. [city] were rowing against us and were leading by half a length at [bridge]. We caught up till we were in the lead by one length. The celebrations that night were fantastic. The champagne flowed and we all got back to college at about three o'clock. That is probably the best day of my life.
      But now I am completely independent. I get up for work at seven o'clock and arrive at [location] at Eight o'clock. My work is very interesting and it consists of sorting out briefs, these are cases where the defendant wants a barrister. I haven't been called to the bar yet so I don't get paid much. I leave work at five o'clock and go home and have some supper. I then meet my girlfriend. She was at college with me and is now at work in a public library. 
      My parents live in Berkshire and I go and stay with them quite often. When I go there I play golf with my father. These week-ends are always very relaxing and the main reason for this is not having to cook.
      My life is interesting and worthwhile and I think being called to the bar will make it that bit more interesting.  Words: 248
