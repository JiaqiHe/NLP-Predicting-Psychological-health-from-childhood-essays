I am now 25 years old. I am a teacher in a Junior school and enjoy it very much. My class are sometimes naughty and so I like to go out at weekends with my husband and two children. A boy and a girl. I still read a great deal and get a lot of information out of it. I also take a dancing class in the evenings. It is the summer and my husband and I like to go out with friends sometimes for a cocktail party or something. I also go out a lot with my brother and his wife and children. There is a lot of school work to mark at nightimes and then I do not get out. It is a good job that their are long holidays. I have to go to nightschool as well, to help me to sit some examinations. Swimming is another pastime at weekends and we have to teach our children to swim as well. Our children belong to a club and often go for picnics. They enjoy it I like new clothes moden ones and nice shoes as well. Our garden has a pond in the middle of it and our dog likes to laze under the willow tree by it. We have two swings and a swing couch. We have a car, a light blue morris 1100. land my husband can drive which is very handy. I like to go though the countryside and have picnics. Our house is situate near the country by a farm and we can get fresh eggs and butter anytime we can also get fresh milk. It is a very good life.  Words: 278
