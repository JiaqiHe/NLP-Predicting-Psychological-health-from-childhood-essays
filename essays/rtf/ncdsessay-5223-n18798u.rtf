When I am 25 years old I will probably be married and have some children. If I do have children I might not go out to work I will most probably have to stay at home and do the housework. But if I do not have any children I might go out to work. On the other hand if I am not married I will go out to work. If I am married I home I will live in a home of my own with my husband. If I do go to work where I am married I do not think it would be gull time I should like to work in a shop half day and I think it would be better to go in the afternoons. I would like to live in in the country or in a small village.  Words: 142
