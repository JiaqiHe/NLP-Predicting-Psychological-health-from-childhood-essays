I was coming home from work, when I suddenly remembred my magazine which I had ordered I ran across the road before the shop shut I ran in but nearly knocked and old ladys hat off. I haden't finished coming out the shop when I saw my two little devils (children) and already one of 'em had a black eye. The other one when he got to me tripped over my foot and went sprawling I picked him back up and he looked to me as if he had been drawn through a hedge backwards. 
We got home without any more mishaps. I haden't got through the door when the potatoes for my tea boiled over, I nearly went mad and treid to find my wife. As usual I found her round next door neighbouts having a W.I. I told her to hurry up and went back round to make a cup of tea then she called out shan't be a minute which in her mind usually means an hour.  Words: 170
