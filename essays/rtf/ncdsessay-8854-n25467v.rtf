When I am 25 first I may be in the army or a comando, then I might be an engine eaer and draw plans for buildings and go and look at them while there being built, and tell builders if they were going wroung, or I might be a man who has a job of going to lits of different countrys and do jobs there and help the people who live in not so good countrys. I might be the manager at a holiday camp, and own quite a bit of land near the sea with a swimming pool and a few speed boats so people go have rides, and lots of little house for the people to stay in, and they would be a big house in the middle where you eat meals and watch film shows and upstairs there would be a lots of room for games.
