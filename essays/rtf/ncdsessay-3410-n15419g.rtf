Iam working in an office i nLondon for a printing company the paper we print is called the Daily Express I print the papers, the firm knock of at 5'O.Clock. To get home I have two travel on London new* railway Victoria line. When I get home, my wife has a big meal on the table waiting for me, on Monday I have fish and chips and on Tuesday, meat pie and on Wednesday lamb chops and on Thursday we have pork chops and on Friday, meat pie.
My wife goes to the village every day to get the shopping. I get up in the morning at 05.30 and get the seven o'clock train from Great Missenden to Marylebone and from marylebone I go on the Bakaloo Line to Oxford Circus and from oxfors circus to Victoria on the Victoria Lone. The office I work in Victoria. When I get to work I oil the printing press, then stack the paper in the paper holder in the printing press, There is another man who sets the letters on the printing press. My mane job is to see that the printing press is in working order.
If the printing press goes wrong then I have to take the printing press to bits and find out what is wrong.
My friend [male name] [surname] is always making the printing* press break down by pulling the wrong levers. The he starts laughing at me when I take it to bits, which makes me angry and when I am angry he says he will go and tell the boss I am wasting my time.  Words: 267
