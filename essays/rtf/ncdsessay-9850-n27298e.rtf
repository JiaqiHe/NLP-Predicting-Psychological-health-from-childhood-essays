"At the age of 25 I should think I will have ) and A levels to get me on a three year training course at Sandhurst (that is the place where people train to get an officer's title or a desent job if not rejected.)
On the television I once saw an advery concerning a job in a tank rejement and ever since I thought I would not mind about xxxx100 a week and a small troop of men under my supervision.
I would buy a small cottge in a sea-side village cut off from the smokey cityies of the world. I would buy some land and ise it as a game reserve. 
The alternative job for me is to be a film produser or director because I think there is alot to be made in films. Take the James Bond film you only live twice which cost over xxxx6,000,000 to produce and it payed back at about double.
I have been on television in a program called ""Playhouse"" and I have been in one* advertisment at the cinema advertizing a hair dresser called Billy's.
So all I'd want is happiness, money, pleasure."  Words: 189
