[name] at Twenty Five              I will get a lovely modern house with a garden. My husband will dig the garden for me and plant seeds. I like flowers so I would like some in each room. I would get a job on sparks, because it is a very clean job. The house I must keep it tidy always incase I get visitors. I would like six children because I like them. I would try and get a house with four bedrooms. In the bedrooms there would be two windows at each side. I would make my children have maners and good health. I would go out to with my husband to clubs and and dances I'am not going to be a pieanier because if you are one you can't enjoy the night out. On a Sunday I would like to get a car and try to go out in the country or the seeside for a picnic. For my holidays I would go to Ireland, for at least a fortnight. My children would have to try and get to college and do well to become a teacher. I would see that they are good Catholics and see that they get to confession.  Words: 202
