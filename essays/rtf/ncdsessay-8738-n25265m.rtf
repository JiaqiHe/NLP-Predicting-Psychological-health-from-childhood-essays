No I am 25 yeard old and I have a new job at the fire station on [road name] road I start today for some fire practic but I have to wait till the fire buzer goes yippee there it is here I go in my new car nearly every body is waiting for me but where is the fire engines there gone with out me but my fire suit is still there Ill go and get it on then race after them here I go there in sight now only if I can get past this lorry then I will be right behind them, no cars comming in front now heres my chance to over take. that night my mother told me to have a bath and strait to bed early in the morning while I was having my bred breakfast I found that I had a big burn on my hand I went strait to the hospital thing put a bandage and told me to put a fresh bandage on every day till it has gone and come on thursday. I diceded to have two jobs 1 in the fire brigade and another to be a council it will be easy for me to get there because the council is up the same road all I have to do is run up the road in to the fire engine. I start the new job next week but I will get more wages if I work hard at the council, phaps I would decorate the house and buy a new green house and new chairs for the front room I could buy all sorts of things there goes the fire buzer again this is the first time I have been to a real fire but what sort of fire will it bee a chimney on fire or a house on fire it looks like a house on fire to me because there are going to be two fire engens going I am in number 1 fire engine we have to get there first to the get the pumps ready and also to se how bad it is if it is very bad we call the other fire engine here but this fire is a big one its a hotel we need a nother fire engine, we really need 6 because its a big place. In [Town name] we have two I will call 2 from [Town name] and 2 from [Town name] it will be a long time before we will get it out because all the people havent got out of the entrance it covered with fire so we will use a tall ladder to get to the top of the building to save the people from the fire  Words: 461
