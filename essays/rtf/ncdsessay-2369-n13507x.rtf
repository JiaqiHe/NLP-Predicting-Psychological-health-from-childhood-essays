It has a well cut hedge with two posts and an iron gate which is painted a golden yellow The cottage itself is white with a thatched roof and pink window frames. In the garden there are roses and tulips and many other flowers. The Bungalow is also white but with no thatched roof. the garden is small but nice all the same and the blue garage and more contrast to the scene. The old oak trees in the wood gape down at the cottage and the bungalow in peacefull silence. The road is a narrow one which twists and turns as it goes on its way. The village a few miles away is peaceful and prefered to the city not far away. The village is a mass of roads, shops, house and people.  Words: 209
