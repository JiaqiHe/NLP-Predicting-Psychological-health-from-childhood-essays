I have joined the army and I am a sargent and I get xxxx1,000 a year. I am stationd in Germany were I am in the Kent Bregade
      Ofen we have to leave the armerd personel cariar, and go out on foot. We work on foot in boged down areas and when we come to rocks.
      The terain is mainly rough in Germany but we have our camp near some rocks on flat ground, there is a stream in the rocks.
      Our routine is to get up at 06.00 get dressed have a wash then have our breakfast. When we have had our breakfas we have a hike come back to camp and have our lunch. After lunch we go out in the armed personel cariare on patrol wen we come back we hav our supper have a chat around a fire and then goto sleep. Some-times we go out on patrols that* last sevral days. I have paid leave on holidays which last 30 days.
