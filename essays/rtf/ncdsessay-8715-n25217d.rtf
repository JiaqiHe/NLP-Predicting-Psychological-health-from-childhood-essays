I live in the country but I work in the restraunt as a Cheff. I have a new bungalow and I am married and have two boys. We have a car a Rover 3 1/2 litre. which we do a lot of travelling in around Britain, When I have a day off. There is one place I would like to go and that is an Island away from everyone whith hot sunshine and freindly natives. But I dont think my dream will come true. The restraunt I work in is an English one not Chinese, *ith all sorts of scrumptious* food. We live in kent my home shire where both our familys live. In our house weve got as many things as anybody else I should think. There is only one thing I don't like and thats [name]. I am no good at gardening so I leave it to my wife while I do the decorating and cutting the lawns and do the woodwork. If there is somthing wrong with the car it goes to the garage. I have forgotten to say that we got a dog from the R.S.P.C.A. kennels. She is a Welsh Border Collie and she is not vicious at all.  Words: 204
