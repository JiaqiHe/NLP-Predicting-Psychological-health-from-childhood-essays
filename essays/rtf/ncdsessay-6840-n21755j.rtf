I am working as a teacher at a Junior school in the country. Every day I catch the 8 15 am bus into the small village where I teach. Living in a large town I have quite along way to go and do my job as the school is five miles away. Today is the beginning of the week so I have to send the record book to the Head. Mr [name] (are head) has a boy in my class so sometimes he has a chat with me about his son's proggress.
      When my class is quite quiet doing their work, it seems that they do much better. At other times when they are noisy and not behaving their work goes down hill. This morning the class has been quiet and have done their work well.    School is my mane subject but in the holidays I am a part time shop assitant.  
      Sometimes when there are a few Gala's I put my name down for my best strokes which are breststroke, front crawl, back crawl and butterfly. Last year I won the back stroke and front crawl, came second in brest skroke and third in the butterfly. 
      I live in a quite big house with three bedrooms. Luckily there is a piano in the the Living Room so I can enjoy myself playing pieces on the piano. When I was younger I took many piano exams and went in a few festivals.
      I am looking forward to get married because the wedding will take place during Christmas-tide.
      I enjoy my life and when I get married I hope my husband will like it too. Two Children will satisfy me and [name].  Words: 283
