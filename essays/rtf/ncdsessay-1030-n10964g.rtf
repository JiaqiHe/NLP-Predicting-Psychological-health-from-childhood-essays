On Saturdays mornings I go shopping with my husband to [town]. When I was there my husband said that he would take me to the Club Fiesta. I said to him that I would have to get some new clothes. I got a mink sh*lle, un eveing dress, and some gloves and shoes. Just as we were going we said to each other we have no one to babysit so we rang up my mother and I asked her if she would baby sit, she said that she would, so we took the two children round to my mother's. She said that they could sleep so we did not have to go back to her house. When we got to the Fiesta Luke was sining to. night, with he was The Marmalaid. When we came out we got all the autographs and the we went home. and went to bed. In the morning we went to collect the children and went to Scarbrough for the day.  Words: 166
