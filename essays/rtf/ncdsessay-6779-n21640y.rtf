I have one child a boy he is 6 months old. I spend most of my time looking after him but in my spare time I like cooking knitting dress making and dancing. When I go out to work I leave my baby at the nursery and my husband collects my son and myself at about 4 pm on the way home from work. I will soon be leaving work and then I will be able to spend longer with my son. At the moment I am a dressmaker and I will be sorry to leave doing it, but I will be glad to have more time to do my hobbies, of which I have already mentioned. In a couple of years I want to have another child a girl but I dont mind if it is a boy. We have a very big garden with a swing and toys for my child to play in. My next door neightbour also has a son. David my son enjays playing with him. My husband works in an office in hatfield he bring's quite a lot of money home of which I am very glad. Every weeks I go to see my motherI take David with me she enjoys see him and he never come's home empty handed she has always to give him sweets.  Words: 223
