When I am 25 years old. I would like to be in the Navy or be a Travelling Salesman. I would like to be a Sailor because it is a very intresting job because you go to diffrent parts of the country and meet diffrent people, Because my ambition is to see the world. I would be leading a happy life with plenty of fun. My intrests would be reading books, getting souvieniers from the places were I would go to show that I had been to those places. My home life would be a happy life, I would like to be happy and well tempered and not gruesome and sad. I think my work would be very intresting because of seeing the world and travelling a lot of time.  Words: 130
