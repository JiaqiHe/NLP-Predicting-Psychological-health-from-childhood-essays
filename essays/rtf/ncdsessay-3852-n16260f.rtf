I am 25 years old and I am now married. My husband is a footballer and I don't work. We have one small daughter called [name] and we live in a very modern house. I am fond of horses and sometimes I go to the local riding school. Each day I get up and my husand and I have breakfast After he has gone out to work I get all the housework done and then sometimes I go out shopping with [name]. [name] is only two and she loves all kinds of animals. Most Saturday after-noons I go to the football match if Jim (my husband) is playing. I spend a lot of time in the library choosing books about horses. My main hobbies are reading, riding and swimming but I also collect stamps. Our house is on the outskirts of the town and we love to go on drives to the country on Sundays. Sometimes we take a picnic tea with us. Once a fortnight my parents and [name]'s come over for tea, they usually take [name] out with them so that we can have some peace. My favourite foods are beans, chips, tea, shrimps and food. I am not very good at needle work but I can manage. I love cooking. Our bedroom is lovely it is all blue, which is my favourite colour. Actually I enjoy life very much.  Words: 232
