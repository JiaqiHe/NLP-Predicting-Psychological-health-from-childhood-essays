"As I came home from my vetery surgan I brought an injured bird with me, it diden't have its tail fethers because of some sort of desiese when it was young. My wife said ""Not another animal to look after"" ""Yes"" I replied ""Im afraid so. If you see a dead magpie or some bird like it bring it back home because then I can give this bird a new tail"". ""Ok I will but go wash your hands dinner is ready."" As I walked through the new house I thought about the bird and then I remembered there was a dead Magpie in Sparrow Hawks wood so after lunch I told my Wife that I were going out to my bird hide with my pencils and crayons to draw the Wood Warbler and to pick up the dead Magpie for the injured bird. I set off with my tape recorder as well just in case I heared the Wood Warbler or any other bird. I was just about to go out when the phone rang. I went to answer it and I was called out again to see a dog because it swallowed a rubber mouse, so I asked my Wife to get the dead bird."  Words: 207
