I will be working at my dads work or if I chang my mind I will set up my my own works and get married. I wish I could be footballer but I dont think so that that is somthing that you have got to stick at it all the time. Alls I wont out of live his to be hope and look after my chilleren. There his something that I would like to do and that his to go right around the world by boat but there his my fathers work and I wont to take over when I am older. When my children are older I would like one to be a nirns and the other to be a doctor. I hope I can give my children the same what my father has give me and my mother. I hope my children are as hape as I am. But I think of all my dreams* and things what could do but they are ownly dreams* and I think that it will not come true. I hope I can look back and say what a good live I had so I hope my children can say that as well. Because my mother and father have give me the things what other children have not got.  Words: 216
