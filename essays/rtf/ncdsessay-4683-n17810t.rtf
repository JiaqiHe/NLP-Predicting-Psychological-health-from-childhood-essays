I am dressed in a paper doctor's uniform and my shoes are wodden. My hair is in a ponytail I am wearing a plastic ribbon. I will soon be going home this is my last lesson for today. If you don't know were I am, well I am in University traying to be a doctor. I have to take a bus to get home. I am going to change into my dress know. The dress is bule light bule with yellow spots on. It reaches me down to my ankle. And it has frils round the bottom. The collar is very stif and it comes right up on my head as a hood but most people still call it a collar. When I am at home I usually do my home work. Put last week I change my mind and I am know living in the University. The bed is in the floor and if you press on the speaical button you will see the bed raising up from under the floor. Most of the things are like that. The funny thing about this room is you could be living in your bedroom and the other minute you could be living in a living-room. Everything works by push button. Most people don't like but I love it. People say that is because I am young. But when I think of I am not realy young. The older jenaration wear dresses wicth reach them up to there knees. That nite be very ungaly but that is how it is. The night flies very fast indeed. Because for me I finished work a nine in the night and start at seven in the morning. I will soon be leaving hear because I nearly finshed my traning.  Words: 294
