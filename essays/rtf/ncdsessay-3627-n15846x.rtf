"When I am twenty five years old I hope I am a nurse. Now that I am a nurse I have had many injured pepole at the hospital I have given medineicne to many people. One lady said, ""she had been in a car crash and had twenty stiches in her hand, One day a nurse called [female name] got her fingur traped in a washing machine and had 9 stiches in it. I will live at home and look after my parents I will share my money with them. I hope to have a cat & dog because I love animals. Once I was sat in a chair at home and my mother burnt her hand in the fire so I bathed it and she had to have fresh air too get to it. Once a lady had to have her appendicks out so I helped with the oporations after a few days she was alright and was well again. When I was twenty two a babby swallowed sleeping tablets. and was rushed too hospital I was there to see to her I thought she wouldn't live, but her mother began to pray and she lived and his living this very day. Once my own auntie was very ill she had a bad hear and was in the hospital she was not death, but when she reached the age of 60 she died of an illness that couldnt be cured. When I first started has a nurse I was scared of blood, but now I am not. I like my life being a nurse and hope to do very well."  Words: 271
