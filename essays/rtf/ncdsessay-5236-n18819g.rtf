When I am twenty five I would like a nice little cottage out in the country where it is peacfull. I would like to have a E type Jag because its a fast car and big inside. I would like a job on a mlik float because I helped the milkman when I was small. But if I could not get a job there I would go where my fathers works at (place) that is a good job because you get something from it. I would get married and share the house with my wife. I would have fields to work in and do the gardening when I am home form work at nights. I would bye potatoes, cabage, carrots, peas and lots of other vegetables to plant in my garden. I would by a swimming pool for when I am off on holiday I would sun bave and swim in the pool. I would bye flowers for my garden and I would have a type writer which I could use when *******. There would be a stream running fast so I could go fishing when I wanted to go. I can remember when I used to catch little minioes and stickle backs and Red Rounes. I would have a bank where I put my money. I would buy a colour television set. with all stations on it. i would like a yacht to sail a round in the river or in the sea when we go to the sea.I would by a bicycle for me and my wife. For her a Raligh and for me a racing bycicle to go for rides on them when we like.  Words: 278
