I am now 25 years old, and I work in an office as a secratery. every day I do the same things , just writing letters and things like that.
sometimes when I'm at home I say I wish I had another job.
I am very interested in typewriting and I do alot of it at home.
Sometimes I go to dances, and I like listening to pop music aswell.
At home I do the work with my mother, but sometimes I just sit down and read books. I have got a boyfriend and sometimes he comes to take me out to dances,  Words: 99
