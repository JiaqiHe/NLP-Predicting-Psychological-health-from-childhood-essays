I have got a fairly reasonable job in a post office I live in a private house on the outskirts of a fairly large town I play football for a Northern League team. I am at home on a wednesday afternoon and all day sunday. I have a wife and two children ussually on sundays we go out onto the mosts for a walk for just about a mile because the children are only small. In the summer we have two holidays one to see my mother and father the other to a holiday resort.  Words: 95
