I get up and get dressed at seven in the morning in order to give (name) my horse a canter on the moons . After this I change into my good clothes and drive to my work. I am an assistant to a vet. Today five pups have been brought in for examination . Once I've catered for them I attend to four donkey's which I agreed to look after . It's break time now and I go for a cofee and a piece of cake. Back to work I go until half past three . When i get home I go to see (name) then have my tea . I have just enough time for a gallop before (name) my best friend comes to take me to a new club which has just opened. When i get home I settle (name) down for the night then hop into bed . I must say life's wonderful. It's morning now and I'mof to a jumping show with (name) I hope we win a prize . The day ends with (name) and I standing at the winners post  Words: 186
