I am getting on very well at home, since that we have only just moved into our new home. I enjoy watching the television. I am very interested in watching [football club] play although I have to go along way I do not mind really because I am interested in seeing new things. While I am on the train I like speaking to people which I have never seen before. Realy I am very pleased with the way I am getting on with my work I find it quite a bit eser to make a thing than to explain how to do it, and also the other people at the place where I work enjoy working with me so realy that gives me a bit more encouragement so realy I can say I am getting on very well at work.
