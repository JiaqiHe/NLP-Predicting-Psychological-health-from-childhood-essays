I am just of on a journey to Malta. The plane is full with holiday-makers. When we get there I am to see that every-one goes through the customs, and has their luggage checked. Then I will have a quick snack in the Maltese resturant, then back to the plane, to go back to Great Britain. My name is **** and I have worked for the B.O.A.C. aeroplane company for five years. When I was twenty I left college after five years of learning languages. After we got back to England, Heathrow Airport, I went to my flat at **** London, or one week. Then I was to go on a long journey to Hawiie. When I reached my flat I found that it had been wrecked my clothes were out of the wardrobe and drawers, and all of the letters which my mother had sent to me from Australia we out of there nicely packed little drawer. I hunted round to see if anything was missing, but it was not. Then I ran down stairs to find the manager. When at last I found him he said that all of the rooms of the hotel had been broken in to , he also said that the police had cought both of the hooligans that had done it. When I had put everything back into its proper place, it was Friday, and I had to go back to my job at the airport. At last the plane was ready for take-off on it  Words: 253
