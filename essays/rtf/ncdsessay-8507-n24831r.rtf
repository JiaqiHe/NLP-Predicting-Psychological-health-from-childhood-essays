at the age of twenty - five I would go back to college to train to be a teacher . I would study hard . after about three - four years training I would leave college after I had left college I would go abroad to work . I would try and get a work permit and go and work in malta . Every day I would get up at 6o' clock in the morning and go for half an hours swimming . When I had had my swim I would go and get ready for my work when i had got to the school I would go to the classroom and get it ready at the end of the day i would go and sun-bathe for an hour . after about four years working I might get married and have children. I would teach them to swim at a young age . I would take them on picnics . I would still keep my hobbys.  Words: 166
