I am twenty five years old. I am marrid and have got two babys I desine dresses for all age groups. I live in a cottage and have got a garage and a car. I have got a modern boutique and have got four assistants. and another if I cannot come because of the children but my mother sometimes looks after the shop or the children. On Sundays after being to the church I take the children for a walk and then go home to have lunch and to give the children lunch. They are a boy and a girl will soon be cristened Steven and Caroline. When they are four years old I will send them to school. on saterdays when the shop it closed in the morning I clean the house as much as I possibly can. Then in the afternoon my mum comes because she likes children or my brother to look after steven and caroline or else my youngest brother takes them in the garden. My husband at a wine merchants shop because his dad owned one and Steven wants to by one of his own. Sometimes Steven and I take the twins out to go and visit my cousin who is marrid as well, she is twenty five too and she has got a son who's name is mark and he is one year old. as well, evry fortnight I go shopping to buy food but I dont have to buy clothes because I make them my self or I take the ones in my shop. and some afternoons Steven and I and the twins go to visit our parents which we do very much.
