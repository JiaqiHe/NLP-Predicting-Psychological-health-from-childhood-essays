If I was twentyfive I would get a Job at the ici, and get a parktime Job as a mechanic. Then I would find my self a garage, so that I could get some more money for my wife. and children. After a couple of years in England I will go to a Austra*lior, untill I are* alout 30. Then when I come back I will find another Job as a train driver in London for a while, and then I will come back to Teeside, and I will buy a bugalow.  Words: 92
