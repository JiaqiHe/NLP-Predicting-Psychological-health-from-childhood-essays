I am now 25 years old, I work as a vetenary surgeon. I am training to be a zoo-oligist, that is a person who studies on the life of animals. I am interested in animals because I have been brought up with them.
The training centre where I train has over ten acres of land. Each surgeon has their own private hut where they eat and sleep. Their are only twenty surgeons and two labratorys in which to train in.
Our job is to heel animals and find cures for different diseases. 
As a child I have longed to get away from school just for a few moments to be free to do as I please, to mix chemicals, just to see what would happen, to take things apart to see how they work.
      That is when I decided that I wanted to be a zoo-oligist.
      When I have learned enough about animals, I hope that one day I will own my own training centre.  Words: 163
