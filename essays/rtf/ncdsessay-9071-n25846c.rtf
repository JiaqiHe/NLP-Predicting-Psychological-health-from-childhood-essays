I AM a newspaper printer for the Daily mirror. every evening I go to the factory where it is done. when I got there I changed into my working clothes then I got the printing machine working while someone placed a big roll of paper on it. First I did the front page all about a bomb explosion in a public library, then the printing ink ran out so I got a big bottle of ink and filled it up again the front Page was Done then it was the back Page I did a* continued story of the bomb and put a big print in of the picture of the wrakage. Page 2 was all about the cinema and a London* ****** that is being pulled Down. The next three* pages were all advertisments. Then was* ****** story about 3 children who got locked up in a supermarket for the night. when* that* had been done it was someone elses turn to do it. Then I a went to see it there* was* *** late news, but there was not so I got back* into my proper clothes and went to the suns arms, a village pub in a village three* miles from home when I came out a went* straight home where my mother and father* ***** they asked me what I wanted to eat and* I said egg, bacon, and chips when I had* fineshed that I had some sold stewed apple. Then I went up into my bedroom and put a few enlish commertures in my 7th stamp album then I went down stairs and read a magazine after that a watched the late night film.  Words: 280
