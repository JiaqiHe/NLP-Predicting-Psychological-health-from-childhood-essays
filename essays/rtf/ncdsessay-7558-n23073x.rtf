I am twenty five years old to-day and I'm going to have a car for my Birthday present and I'm so exited about it, but first I must take my little girl [name] to a Nursery at 10-45 then my husband joe will go and do the shopping for me. While I wait until the man delivers the car then I will have a drive around init for a while. I have got a day off work today instead of tomorrow, I work in a cotton factory dying the cotton of allshapes and sizes and I like my job very much. I go to work with my husband [name] at 8. am because he works at the same factory as I go to only he doesn't do the same thing as I do, [name] makes the cotton reels and passes them on to me and then I put the dry cotton on them. And I come back at five-o-clock and [name] comes home at 6.p.m. and before I go home I go and pick [name] up from the Nursery and then go and make [name]s tea for when he comes back from work.
