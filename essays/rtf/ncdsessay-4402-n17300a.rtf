I would like to have a job as a singer and all the money that I would get, I would put most of the money in the bank and the rest of the money that is left I would buy clothes not only for me but for my family aswell. I'de like to live at Burmingham and for a change I would go to London. If I passed for my singing and got the money I would not be a miser with my money. The reason why I picked Burmingham was because there are not so many rough boys as there are at [place name?]*. Between my singing I would help mum do the house-work and at night times I would to a dance to the pictures with some friends, go out with my boyfriend. I would like to learn ballroom dancing with my boyfriend, if I have a boyfriend I want one who will not drink too much who will not smoke and swear. I will not wear to much make up and I wont go mad over clothes. I would like to go to Spain for three weeks and the go back to Burmingham and carry on singing. When I get married I want to have a white wedding with the bride groom in pink  Words: 217
