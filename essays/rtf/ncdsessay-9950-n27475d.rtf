I would like to play football and own a sports shop. The position I would like to play in is centre-forward. In my shop I would sell something for every sport, including sports games for boys and girls. I am interested in boating and flying. On holidays I would sailing on Lake Ullswater. My home life would be a normal one. I would like to have a family and a nice home. I think I would try and join a glider club. Where I would live I don't yet know. I think would like to do small jobs in my spare time. When I go on holidays I would like touring with a caravan rather than stay at the same place all the time. If I played football my ambition would be to play at Wembly in a cup final.  Words: 140
