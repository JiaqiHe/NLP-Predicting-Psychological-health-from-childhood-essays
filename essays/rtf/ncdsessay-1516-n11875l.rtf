I am 25 years old and I live at [house number] [street name] my hobbies are going to choir, reading books, making models, and writing poems and stories on historical things like haunted houses and battles.
The best thing is going to choir, I like singing because I enjoy choir.
My work is a manager in a Gas factory sometimes when a lorrydriver is away I have to takeover, I have to go to all the different places like in Bath and Bristol to unload.  Words: 83
