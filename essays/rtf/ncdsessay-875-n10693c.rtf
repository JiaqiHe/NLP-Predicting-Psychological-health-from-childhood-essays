I am 25 so I do not have to live with Mum a Dad any more, if I stay at their house I would pay for my keep and clothing, food etc... at first I would go to University and take Drama Music and English, (Art would be a hobby) I would try to go to the lectures on these subjects, I would try to learn French a Latin which I would find useful in later life, I would try and get a degree so I could apply for any job, because after University I might think of becoming a Nun and if I haven't got a vocation I wouldn't be able to get a job if I haven't got the degree.
When I came home I would be helpful to Mum and Dad if I lived with them, if not I would not buy a record player and go round long haired boys! I should try to live a quiet peaceful life and would wear decent, smart clothes and would buy a small homely flat that I could share with my colleges, I should cook simple meals, because I might burn elaborate continental meals.
If I do not get a vacation I would try and teach History and English to girls of ten and eleven, I would not reel off dates and things they would not understand, I would tell the lives of famous people like Thomas More, Henry VIII, Elizabeth the first and Edmund Campion because he is such a good person I think his name should be more widly known.
I would be a guide captain and I would teach the guides knots and take them camping and let them make gadgets.
I would then find a very nice boy with good manners and a good charecter not just a handsome face. We should share a farm and have eleven kids that would all grow up to be clever and pretty.  Words: 320
