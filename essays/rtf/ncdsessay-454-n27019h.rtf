When I am 25 years old I would like to become a hairdresser. I would like to start paracticing [practising] at the age of 25. I also like helping in the home which I enjoy after school days.  When I am older than 25 I would also like to be just as modern as any other people, I would spend most of my time at home or a part time hairdresser as before. I would like to keep my home as clean a I could.  I would like to have two children as well as to kepp [keep] my house tidy. I would be hovering and be doing irioning [ironing] most of the day.  I also would like to keep as tidy as I could. Then I would have well brought up children. When I get older and retire from hairdressing.   I would like to lead a jolly and an active life as before when I was younger. Allthough when I leave work I also would still like to be willing to help other people in their homes and their minds, and to still keep myself and my children as well as my home.   I would still like to a lot of sewing and dress-making though, because it is my hobby. At the age of 35 I do not want to do any more work except in the house at all. I would still like to keep jast [just] a bit less modern than before. I would like my husband to keep this way aswell, and like to be just as cheerfull as I will be.  Words: 266
