I am 25 years old I have a job at civil service, and I work five days a week, and I get very good wages. When I get home about quarter to six, I have my tea, then if it is a hot day I go swimming, Later on I go to the library and collect four books on poetry and adventure stories too read. About half past nine I always see my boy frend and may be we go to the palaye. Twice a week, We go to the pub, three days a week, and camping over the weekends. And when I come back I take my little sisters to a park. When I have had my boy, two years I would get married but I have had him three years so I will get married in about half a year's time.
