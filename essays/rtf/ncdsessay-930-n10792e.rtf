I am now twenty five years and I am a teacher. I am married and I have one child called [name]. My daughter which is five years old is in my class, I teach in an infants school. When it is time to go home I take my daughter home in my car because my husband and I have a car each. When I get home I start cooking tea, and after tea I sit down and do some knitting or some needlework. I like swimming and knitting. I went to college and sat about five O, levels and some A, levels, it was very nice at the college. My husband is an electrician he is working afternoons this week, so just before I go to the school I have make his sandwiches.  Words: 133
