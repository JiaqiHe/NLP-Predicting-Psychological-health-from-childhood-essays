At the age of twenty five I am now at University. I find it a very interesting life and have lots of hobbies such as Riding, swimming and Gardening. I have always been fond of horses but I have never had the opportunity to own one. I see my parents every two months and I also have quite long holidays. When I finish my training I hope to be an architect. My home life is very interesting as I am always gardening or swimming in the sea, as the sea is just 10 minutes walk from my house. I would always like to go abroad to forein countries but so far I have not. At University my studies are planning houses and also finding how much material it would take to build them. I plan how big the house is to be and what size and shape it is to be. So far I have designed twenty two houses but only two are satisfactory as the others would take two much material or would be too complicated. I don't wish to get married yet but  at about twenty eight is my time after I have seen the world. I would own a farm if I could so I could keep a horse. and be surrounded by animals. At University it is very comfortable and very homely. There is a large library and it contains a large number of books. There is also apparatus for sport such as swimming pools and also a riding stable. The dormitorys* are very well equipped with wash basins and a radio. I do not watch television much as most of my spare time is taken up by hobbies.  Words: 283
