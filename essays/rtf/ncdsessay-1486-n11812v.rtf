I am now 25 years old and I work at a factory making models. I have been working there since I was 16 but I am now 25. I have been working there for nine years. I will be learning from the factory and going to a nother place. I dont know if I am going to a nother place yet because I want to stop at home for a rest. I might start to work at an hairdressers shop in [town]. when I Leave from the factory were I work at now. at the age of 16 when you leave they all start to rip there coats and go mad. but when I Left school I didnt rip my coat I kept it till my youger sister went there. Instead of buying her one. I helped them to buy her a unifrom but after I buyed all what she needed, I forgot to get her a new blazer. because that was to big for her I gave her. I didnt now it was till she tried it on. It looked to big on her because she was only small. And she only wnated a small size not a big size. because she dont like them big. they look horrible when they are big.  Words: 214
