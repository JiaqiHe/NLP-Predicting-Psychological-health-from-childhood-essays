----------------------
I am married and i am working as a shop manageress in a super-market. This work quite interests me as i meet many people. During my spare time i usually do cooking or dressmaking these are hobbies of mine. Sometimes i watch the television at night. Every Wednesday and friday i go to dressmaking (advanced) at night, and keep-fit on friday.
I enjoy riding every so often perhaps on a Sunday. you may think that i'm out all day but i'mcertainly not as I manage to find time look after and cook for one hungry husband. I have a little girl called J(name). She is going to school now and so i can work again.
I live in a semi-detached just outside (name of place) It is quite a large town but not too noisey. I hope to continue this very happy life but I don't know Occasionally i go sailing but i usually get wet so I've given that up who knows what the future will bring  Words: 166
