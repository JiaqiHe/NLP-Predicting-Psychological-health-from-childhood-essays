By Dad ', I'm off to play jaz music in the village hall be back at about 12 midnight. Every evening I go down the road and play jaz music. I play the saxophone with my freind, the famous, 'Niek [Surname]' on base. 'Gordon [Surname]' plays the piano and 'Andrew [Surname]' bashes away on the drums. On Sunday afternoon I play tennis for it is my favourite pastime. In winter I go swimming and play chess. I live with my parents in [xxxxxxx]. I own a car which is the new capri. I enjoy travelling and go around with Gordon a number of times. The house I live in is not mine but my parents. Most of the time I travel around to do my performance and occasionally have to when I am on holiday I don't get paid so I have to take short holidays. My life is very enjoyable because playing music is a pleasure.  Also as a pastime I do amateur radio morse calling in this I started off by learning the morse code ....etc. Then after bying a reciever I practised by listening on the it. As life proceeded I gradually built up this set until I had a massive aerial and when I have nothing to do I listen to morse conversation conversations myself.  I hardly do any writing on paper and I am always doing activities.  Words: 232
