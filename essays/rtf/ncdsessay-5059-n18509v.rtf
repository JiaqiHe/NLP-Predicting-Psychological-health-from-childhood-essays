I am a builder. I earn around xxxx25 a week. It's interesting work. Each day we come and go I took out at the buildings. They're coming along now,. The parts I don' t like are working in the rain, measuring things all over again and being told off by people who dn't want their veiw spoilt. We're like indiand for building. For a few months you're on one building site, when it's finished and the people are living in the houses, you move on to another building site and so on and so on. Mind you, the family dos'n't move with you. You live in one house, perhaps sometimes you buy a house on the building site you've just left or haveplans of buying a house you're working on now. Sometimes you have delays like the bricks not coming for a couple of weeks or a house collapsing under nasty winds. If there is a stream or a river neaby, we do'n'y build the houses near it for fear of floods but on the other hand it is possible to divert.  Words: 182
