My husband is also a vet, we work together. Our garage is used as a surgery and a shed as a waiting room. When we have got some more money we are hoping that we shall be able to aford, another building in sted of the shed, to be a waiting room. I got to night classes twice a week, one of the night classes is Vetenery, the other is animals. Last time I went vetenery class we lernt about ricked and [illegible fiche] muscles. Late last night I had an urgent phone call from a lady whos dog had been run over. I went over there strate a way. When the dog was pulled off the road and into the house I was that it had a broken leg and a crushed [illegible fiche]. After I had treated him I said that I would viset him twice a week for three months and after that she must not let him run a round much or else it will do him more harm than good. I like my job very much.  Words: 217
