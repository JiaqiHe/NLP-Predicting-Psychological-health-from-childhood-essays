I am now twenty five I work for the English police force. I live in [city] and I am a constable, I have a wife and two children we have the house in a special estate. Some times I am working away, or at the [football ground]. In my spare time at home I make a few improvements in the house. Like putting new sheelves up or a cupboard, and also doing jobs in the garden. I keep tropical fish of various kinds like Zebra's shark's catfish etc. In my spare time from work on a Saturday I go down to [football club] where I am a member on the ground staff. On a Saturday night I go to the pub to talk to some of the fellers that are in work with me. On the Wednesday night I am in charge of the junior section in the Boy's Brigade. Somtimes I take the children to the *library to get them books to interest them oither times I take them down to the zoo to see the animals*. I go to all the schools in the area telling the children about road safety showing them pictures and films on the road, other times I am taking to the children* on their cycling profi*i*ss test. I am thinking of getting moved to a security guard in the U.S.A. and working in the the main bank in New York. There is a scheme working that you give some money out of your wages and it goes to wards you when you retire.  Words: 260
