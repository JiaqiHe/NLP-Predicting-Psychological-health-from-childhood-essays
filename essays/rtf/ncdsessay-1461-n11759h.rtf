I am hoping to be married and have at least two children. I will live in a house built by bricks and surrounded by flowers. The house has three windows. I will work in a factorie and make fur coats. I will work part time. I will do knitting for the family I will do sewing. as well. The house will be tidy and clean so that the children can play. When I am working in the house I will lisen to the records on the radio. I work on a night from half past five to half past ten. During the day my husband is working on the buses so I do the housework. Then he comes in at five o clock and we get our teas* then I get ready for work. My husband looks after the children till I come home from work, he puts them to bed at eight o' clock. When I work I sing because that is one of my hobbies. We have three an electric radiators one in the dining room, one in the living room and one in the hall. We hani have an electric light in the kichen, one in the Dinning room and one in the living room. We have four book cases in the house. The kichen is rather large and has a big table in it with four chairs.  Words: 231
