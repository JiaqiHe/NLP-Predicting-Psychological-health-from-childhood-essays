When I am 25 I would like to become a nurse. In my spare time I would go horse. In the hospital I would like to be in an adult ward. At the wee-ends I would go home and stay with my parents. On Saturdays I would go with a friend into town or go climbing. At night time we would go for walks. 
When I was about 25 I would like to get married. After I was a bit older I think I would like to have two girld and two boys. We would live in a quite village and would like to have plenty animals. When my children had grown-up a bit I would go back to nursing for a few years.
I will take my children to a nursery school when they are about three or four. I would take the children once a week to see their grandmother and grandfather. When the children were about the age for starting school I would try and get them interested in animals and swimming.
I like working in the garden and doing outside jobs. After the children were over ten I would take them to a riding school. When they were this age I would only go out nursing at nights. In the summer I will always take the children away thier holidays and take them picnics.  Words: 226
