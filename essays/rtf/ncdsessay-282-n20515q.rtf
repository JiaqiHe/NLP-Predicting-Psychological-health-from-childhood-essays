I have a gardening job and in my spare time I make large plastic kits. I sometimes drink but I dont smoke. I have a dog called policeman plod I also have three cats kitty mew and choo choo chatinougat a monkey called Sam and a turkey called chester. One day I took [xxxxxxx] to [xxxxxxx] for a run around, suddenly he saw a rabbitt he darted off and I ran after him calling him back he came running back with the rabbitt unharmed in his mouth, After we had gone to the park I found [xxxxxxx] had come to the door to greet me. when I went into the kitchen I found kitty and Mew on the boiler fast asleep. [xxxxxxx] kindly took my hat off but tried to eat it I eventually got him back When I went to work the next morning the manager was Ill and to my amazment I was ment to take over. well I told the others what to do and one of them said 'Why should I do what you say?' I told him what had happened and he said no more about it when I got home I was completely fagged out but thank goodness my pets were helpful.  Words: 208
