I have left teaching college and now have my own class in a school. I teach 4 th year children in a Junior school. My favourite subject is Arithmetic and the children in my class do 20 sums a day. The school that I am working in is very nice. I have been teaching my own class for nearly three years now, and find it very enjoyable*. There are thirty-five children in my class and about two-thirds of them work very well, but the otheres are improving quite well. It is quite a long drive from where I live with my parents. I go out with my girlfriend nearly every night. We are engaged, and we are getting married in two or three months time. We are buying a house and have put a deposit down on a house in an estate. I have bought some furniture and it is in the shop still, because the house is not built yet, only the foundations are down and the water pipes, and also a few rows of bricks The builders say that the house will be ready in about* another month or so. When I do not go out with my girlfriend I watch telivision or read a book. In the weekends we go out in the country or to a fair.  Words: 221
