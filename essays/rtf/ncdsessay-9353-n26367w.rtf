My interests would be climbing and Singing. At the house I would bake a cake and washup. I might work at a hair dessers place or be in a egg factory. I would be married and have no children at all. And I would go out and do shopping. We would have a Jack Rulles dog. In an eeg factory you put eggs in boxs. In the house I would make the beds, dust and Sweep the floor. My work could be in a Post Office or a girl who works in a shop.  Words: 94
