When I am 25 year's I will have joined the Fleet Air Arm and will have joined triple six squadron for my training, I will try to fly in Buccaner's and by that time [school name] Junior School will be made bigger by the adding of six more classrooms. I will still be living at 13 [street name], but I will move very soon, when I go overseas with the Fleet Air Arm I hope to be moved to Trident's. By that time England will have won the world cup 13 times, and Gordon Bank's the goalkeeper will be replaced by Peter Shilton. I will buy a new house in America and be promoted to Wing Commander. I will still collect model aircraft, ship's and tank's and I think I will have a happy life and get married. After I get married I will come out of the Fleet Air Arm and I will start a toy shop.
