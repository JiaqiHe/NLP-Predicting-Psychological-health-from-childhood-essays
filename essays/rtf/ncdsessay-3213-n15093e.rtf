There would be five rooms a kitchenette and a bathroom. and a library with books that my children , my mother, my husband and I read. We would have no quarrls or arrguments. The girl and boy I would name (name), (name). The children would have a little garden of their own. My husband and I would have a car each . My car would be a little red mini . I would go to work every day and have a friend or someone to watch the children when they come home from school. At work which is singing I would have quite a lot of friends and my manager would have to be nice or I would not work. I would like to have a great number of records made when I am 25. At home I would hope to keep my furniture shinning and my children neat and tidy.  Words: 193
