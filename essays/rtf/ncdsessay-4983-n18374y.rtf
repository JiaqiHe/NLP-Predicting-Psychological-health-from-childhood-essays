I am working as a proffesional footballer My age is 25. I am working with the football club Tottenham Hotspur. On a Tuesday morning I go down to White Hart Lane (that is where they train) After 2 hours training I get into my car (which is a Cortina) and drive into London and do my morinings shopping. For my dinner I have a strak and kidney pie, carrots and potatoes. In the afternoon I have about 2 houres sleep. In my sleep I dream that I will become a very famous and talented footballer. I dreamt that I scored over 50 goals in one season. After my 2 hours sleep I go outside and do some gardening. I dig out weeds and dead plants. When I see a few friends I talk to them for about 15 minutes then I carry on with my gardening. After I have drunk my cup of tea I go outside and play football with the children who are already outside playing football. After a while I come on in and start cooking my dinner. For my dinner I have bacon, liver and cabbage. At ten O'clock I turn of my television and go to bed.  Words: 202
