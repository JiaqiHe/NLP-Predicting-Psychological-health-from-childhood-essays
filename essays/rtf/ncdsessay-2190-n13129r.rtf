"I am now 25yrs old. I am called Mrs [name]. Sometimes the housework seems as if it will never be right. I do the housework at night. I work at a hairdressers. I do not make a large dinner through the week except on Sunday. Every Sunday I go to church. On my day off work I do the housework then sit down and have a nap. After i have woke up I sit and read for half an hour then I go shopping. As my day off is Friday most shops are open. After the shopping I pop in next door for a little chat. Then most of the time I stick things in my private scrap-book. I sometimes have a game of tennis with a friend. Sometimes I can have a very nasty temper. That does not occur very often. I do not like my dresses below the knee. The shoes I get have to be ""mod"". I like my hair to hang down. Every Friday at six o'clock I go to a friends house for tea. Every Sunday I have my parents and my husband's parents for the day. Every Sunday night I go out with my husband to a club for an hour or two. I do not stay out long as I have work to do next day and I have to be up very early. I have to catch a bus to get to work. It is a ten minute ride to work on the bus."  Words: 252
