Hello my name is Mr  [surname] I am going to tell you how I lead my daily life.
Well my Job is a Bank Clerk and I work at the Midlands bank I have an Estate Car but I walk to work I take my son too the park when I come home and have my dinner when I come back.
I have one holiday every year and I go by car ferry to Ireland and I take my mum and dad with my family and I.
On the way we eat at restraunts and when we get there we stay at my aunts house. Well that is how I will spend my daily life when I grow up.  Words: 116
