When I get a job I hope that it will be a Football player. My favourite position is either centre forward or Right half.
In my house It will be a bit up to date. There shall be two spare rooms and a kitchen and Hall with a living room and dining room. If there are not any stairs then there will be a lift. The houses then will be different from now. My other intrests are (apart from Football) hockey and rugby. If I had the job of a Telephone fixer then I would be quite happy. I also would not mind being a policeman.
If I was to be a football player then I would like to play for Rangers FC. I like playing in defence and in the attack. My two favourite players are Goeff Hurst and Martin peters. My favourite player just now in The Rangers team is Davie Provan. I suppose I will have some intrests of which I like. I think it will be coin collecting or stamp collecting. I may join the army. I think that I would like to be rich and go to quite a few places. I thing It shall be great in the year 1993  Words: 204
