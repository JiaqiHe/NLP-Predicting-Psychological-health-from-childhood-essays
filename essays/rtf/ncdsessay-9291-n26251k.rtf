I should like to become a nurse because I like working in hospitals and it is quite a good job some nurses get paid ones a week and other onces a mounth and you get good money. And you were a hat and a dress with strips on it and a sort a a penny and if you ever go outside they give you a cape to were it's colour is black and you have two long bit of materiel hanging down to fasten in to a bow. you have to take some tests to become a nurse and you take medical tests. I would like to be on night shift and when you put your hat on if you have got long hair you have to have it tied up in to somthing. And in some Hospitals you work in one and you live in anoughter. Some nurses thinks it is a tiering job. And others enjoy it. There are lots of people wanting to become nurses.  Words: 168
