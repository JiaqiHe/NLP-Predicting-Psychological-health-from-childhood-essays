I live out in the country of the suxex downs. The sea is a mile away and there are lots of interesting places to go* see. I oftern spend my spare time traveling around in my car. I have a small cottage and i live alone. I have a large garden and inside the house it looks very nice. My house is full up with modern funiture and has pictures round the wall. My car is a Mini and its colour is blue. I have no garage so i keep my car outside the house and it oftern breaks down. I have a small garden with a fishpond in and two trees. Flowers grow all around it and then it leads out into lots of fields. I have got a dog like a mungrle collye and he is white.  Words: 194
