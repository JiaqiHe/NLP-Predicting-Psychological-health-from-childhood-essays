When I am 25. I am marred to a Farmer. And we have two childen. A girl of four and a boy of two. I go to work on Monday Tuesday Thursday and Saturday. On Monday I have a lady in to look after them. On Tuesday and Thursday my little girl goes to nursary school and My Mother looks after my little boy. I only work mornings. On Saturday my husband looks after them. My job is a vet. I work not very far away. Sometimes I walk and sometimes I go in a bus. Mostly the animals I get are dogs and cats, birds with broken wings or Rabbits and Gine-pigs which have jumped out of their hutches and have Broken legs. Now and again I get an unusll animal like the other day somebody brought me a young chimpanzee. And about a month ago my husbands friend said he had an old lame horse so my husband told him to bring in to me which he did. At home we have quit a lot of animals in cloding the farm wons. And although I sometimes get a bit fed up with it I like the life I live.  Words: 201
