It is early on a Friday morning, at about half past seven. I get out of bed and put the kettle on and then get dressed. After breakfast I get on the train to go to work. After leaving the train I walk to the restraunt where I am a chief. I usually arrive there at about quater past ten and leave at six oclock. The cooks rooms are split up into sections and in each one they make a diffrerent thing. I work in the sandwich section I am usually busy all the time. I work on Saturdays too but I have all of Sunday off and Thursday. My interests are cooking that is why I became a cook. I get home from work at about seven o'clock then I have my supper and either watch the television or go out with a friend and sometimes to a club.  Words: 150
