I am at home sitting down reading a paper and drinking tea at half-past six ready to go to work and I work at a coal-mine and before I went to the coal mine I was at the army I was in the army for 6 years and it was 6 years of fun. My birthday was on march the 4 19-69 when I started wotk I was twenty five years old and I sometimes plat football and other kinds of interesting sports in October I will get married and I hope I will have at least 20 children and big house. For my wages I get 100 pounds a week And I hope I live near a big village or town and near a great shopping centre so I only haft to cross the Road and I am there and there are no buses to catch nor taxis. I just pick what i want and just leave it to be* deliverd at my house and I can pay as much as to 50xxxx on my groceries. And I would like to have 10 different kinds of plants in my garden and I would have ten different kinds of cars one would be a royals Royce, a masacles artomatic, and best of all the rest different colours of E, and D Type jaguars, and own castles and Buckingham palace and all parks wich the queen has and lots of beautiful clothes and I have lots of different kinds of parties and invite all my friends ** dinner and invite my mum and dad to come and stay over night and have breakfast and lunch and I would go on holiday and own a house in South America and Australia and drive a round in my great E type jaguars me and my wife having picnics and visiting the queen and her royal men and I would lilke to take over Harold Wilsons place as priminister and go to the queen and borrow some money off the queen and if I had no money. And if I was Harold Wilson then I wouldn't have to borrow money from the queen because I would have millions of pounds of money for priministing and going to funerals of the members of parliament and having peace talks with all the other primeministing.
