I am 25 years old and in the army and I would like to be an engineer and in my speare time I would go to the dance hall every so often and meet a girl freind who I might want to marry I would like to be in the army football team. 
I would go home on leave and go out to the pub for a drink. At the pub I would enjoy my self while I was at home on the last few days that I had. I would go abroad with the army and enjoy life while it was at it best. and if I enjoyed the army I would sine on for a few more years. The longer I am in the army the better chance I have of getting my strips. 
I would pass an meany egzams as I could and if I passed them all I would get my strips a lot easyer then just slowly learning.
If I left the army I would be an engineer in a garage. I would write home twice a week to my mother and father. When I came home on leave I would bring them all some thing home.
I would like to be about 5ft 11in tall and have a strong body and big mucals.  Words: 217
