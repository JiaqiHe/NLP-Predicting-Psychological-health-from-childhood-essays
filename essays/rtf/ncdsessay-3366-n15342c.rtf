When I am twenty five I would like to marry a farmer and have two or more children. I would like to live on a farm in the country. Though I would like to be a house-wife I would like to help on the farm and in my spare time I would do some drawing and painting. I would like a horse and two or more dogs probably big ones like Labradors. The garden would be quite big and would not be to enclosed with high hedges. I would have a bungalow with large windows the kitchen would have bright wall-paper the childrens bedrooms would be covered with wallpaper with Pictures on My husband's and my bedroom would have bright patterned wallpaper. The dining room would be quite small and would probably be the dullest room. The lounge would have a large window opening opening onto the farm it would be a bright room. We would probably have a family car not too big but big enough. I would go hunting on my horse and perhaps help out at the local pony club. My Paintings would probably be of animals exspecially horses. We would probably go to different places for our holiday but not abroad till the children where older. our farm would probably be a dairy farm but we would have some* cattle, sheep and Pigs. If I had Labradors I would probably have black ones.  Words: 237
