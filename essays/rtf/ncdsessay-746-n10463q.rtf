I hope that I will work at a farm and start at about 7 o'clock and finish 6 o'clock. In my spar time I will do some scrambling. I expect I will be maried then. I hope that I will live in (town) somwere near the sea. I will go swiming now and then I might play football or cricket somtimes. I will have a moter bick for the road as soon as I get enough money then I will have a car. I might go to another country if I do I will go to canada.  Words: 97
