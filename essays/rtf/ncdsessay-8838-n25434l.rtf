When I am 25 years old I would like very much to teach music at a school. When I go home I would probably help my mother to do things. During holidays I would like to go to Canada or Australia. At home I would do some of the work for my mother so that she could have a rest and do the same for my father also. My interests would be going to concerts and going for a drive along the countryside. I would go to church and try to help charity. I would like to go out with my friends to shows like My Fair Lady. I would do things like doing the shopping for people who could not get around very much. I would like to make my life a good and happy one.  Words: 137
