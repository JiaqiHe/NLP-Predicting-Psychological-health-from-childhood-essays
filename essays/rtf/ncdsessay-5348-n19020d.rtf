I meet a lot of people when I am working. I live in a small country house. When I have finished work I go home and get the tea ready for my husband when he comes home from his job which is farming When i have finished doing the washing up and the otehr jobs I sit down to read a book or to to look at my stamps. As it gets later I go to bed to wake up to another days work. I walk to work. When it comes to dinner time I have my dinner in the hospital cantine. My neighbour cooks a dinner for my husband. In my apre time I ride horses or swim with my friends. If I have a day of work I spend most of my time doing house work. Sometimes I go out for the day.  Words: 175
