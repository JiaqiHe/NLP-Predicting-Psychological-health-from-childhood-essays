I am 25 years of age. I have no children. and I enjoy my home live. I am interested in swimming. I work as a secutary. I did not enjoy my work at first, but I got used to it. now I know I am not a stranger, and I have been married for 2 years now. my husband owns a shop. My husband is 26 years of age, and we go swimming together when we get the day off, but we often go into the country near our home, we usually take a girl with us from the orphanage, for we have all ways wanted a child of our own. we also have parties. We enjoy our lives, and every one is so kind. My manager is very helpful, but I like being at home, where I can do what I want, in my spare time I do some cooking, and move furniture round to diferent positions. My husband spends his spare time painting. We modernised our home when we first moved into it, and when we had our first party, people told us how nice the house looked.  Words: 190
