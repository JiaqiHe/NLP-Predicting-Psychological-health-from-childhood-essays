I am a piolet for the new [aeroplane]. I have been training for three years, and have all the knolegle of a fully trianed piolet.
      I am very interested in flying, all aeroplanes, reading and sometimes a game of football when I have time.
      I am going to be a day piolet for seven hours, my root shooed be from [city] to Amrica.
      My home life is not to much afeckted by this. Because I will only work for eight hours, and once every three week I do a longer flyet from [city] to Armrica (New York) to Rio De Janeiro and then the return flyet, the hole flyet there and back takes 13 hours.
      On Sundays and half day Saturdays I usuly have of, but somtimes I have to work on some papers. When I am thirty four I hope i will be able to fly the .Concord and go to many more place than New York and Rio De Janeiro, I will have to know more knowlegle of flying and have to speak more langrigis than I do now.
