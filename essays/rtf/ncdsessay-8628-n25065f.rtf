I am leading a very enjoyable life at my job of solli*itor, I have now done my apprentice and am working full time at the practice of a relation of my father's. The work, is hard though if you are good humoured and a good worker it is not all that bad. Now I know most of the Law-courts of England, I travel a lot to judge different cases. Sometimes I have to do deskwork form about nine o clock in the morning till around five at night.
The pay is very reasonable for what I do. Often their are problems which I cannot solve so I have to refer these to my superiors.
My life is enjoyable and I enjoy the weekends most of all. that is when I go back to my wife Joanne. then we go and look everywhere with* lots of laughter and gaietey.
At home I have lots of hobbies, I am an amateur archaeologist, I like having the odd drink down at Home This is normally some sweet cherry. as my wife Was going to the cinema or theatre we go most weekends, also we always* go to a nearby church on Sunday Mornings.  Words: 197
