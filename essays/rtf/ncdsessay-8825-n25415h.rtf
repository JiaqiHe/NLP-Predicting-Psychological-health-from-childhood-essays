----------------------
I have quite an easy life when I am not at work. I go out nearly every night with a friend. If I donot go out at night I usually do some kitting or needlework. I also enjoy going iceskating at the weekends and I sometimes instruct children of the age of about five or six. Working in a bank is what I do for a living and I enjoy doing this because you meet some very interesting people some pleasant and others not so pleasant. I get quite a good wage and I donot have to work full days. When I am not working at the bank I work a few hours in a near by sweet shop. Usually I go to Spain for my holiday and have a week or two travelling round. I live in a little bungalow in the town of [town] which is in [county] with a friend called [name] we get on very well together and both enjoy decorating our little bungalow. I do not want to get married till next year.  Words: 178
