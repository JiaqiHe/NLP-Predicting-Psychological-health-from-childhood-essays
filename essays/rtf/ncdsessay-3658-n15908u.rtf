When I am twenty five I would like to be an Air Hostess I know it takes a lot of convidence and hard work but I will practice. I will lead an ordinary life with its certain complications. My interests are cooking and spring cleaning the house that I live in If I marry I would like someone dark and handsome If I do become an Air Hostess I would work for BEA Although I will be away from my family I will enjoy the differant countries that I would go to. I would exspecialy like to go to New Zealand to see my uncle who I have never seen in my life before. I would also like to go to Switzerland and Mexico. I would like to go to Mexico to see where they had the 1968 Olympic games, because my special study is all about the olympics, because my special study is all about the olympics, and I would like to go to Switzerland because I would love to climb the mountains there and I would like to learn to ski like an expert. My home job if I did not become an Air Hostess I would become an olympic swimmer on my back and practice every evening after tea, and in the day time I would like to be a dinner lady at a school. If I do not become any of these I do not know what to be I might just be a ordinary house wife and let my husband earn the money.  Words: 258
