I am 25 years old. I am a nurse in the (hospital). My job is to look after children. In the morning the patients are up for breakfast at 6am. Visitors come at 2pm after that the doctor comes around. At 4pm they have dinner. When 8pm comes I am glad because the children are all sleeping and I can sit down for half an hour. At 10pm I can go home for a sleep. In the morning I have to get up a 7am . A night I get home at 12 pm. 
On my day off I sometimes go to the cinema with my own children. My family consists of my 4 children my husband and myself.  Words: 119
