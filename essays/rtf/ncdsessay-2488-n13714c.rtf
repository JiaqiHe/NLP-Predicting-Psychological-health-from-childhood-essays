When I live school I would like to be a very good football and get sent away to one of the football culbs. If any-body asked me witch team I would like to be in I would say Leeds U.T.D. or West Ham. Because you can earn quite alot of money in football because If say I did go into Leeds U.T.D. team I would get xxxx100 pounds aweek. At Scarborough there is a football team and Scarborough goalkeeper is earning xxxx25 aweek. I would not mind been a goalkeeper because I am quite good at it my favirite places in football are goalkeeper - center half and right back. First thoew you have to send away for a trail to see how you get on. But when I was about six I said that I was going to be a moter maknack. Sometimes I go to the Scarborough match to see them play If I can erford it sometimes. But I go with my Uncle is his car and he takes me to Leage matchs not in the Northern Primer* Leage because I wen to see York City and Port Vale play once York City won 3 2 to York. Then I went to see Scarborough and Wigan play Wigan play excecily well a gainst Scarborough but WIgan had nine full times but Scarborough play very well in the scend half of the match as wigan played back as well. Wigan won 2. 1. to Wigan.  Words: 247
