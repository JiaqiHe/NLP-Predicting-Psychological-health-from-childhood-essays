I will be an electrician and will go where every my job takes me. I will not be marryed. If I can not be that I will be a carpenter and live in Sheffield. And if I cannot make it I will be a ship designer. My interests are drawing and fiddling. Life will much more civilised and travel will be alot easyer work will be harder to find because of increasing mechanisation* and computeriseation. All hotels will be modified with the latest equipment. My work would be hard because of minitureised* circuits.  Words: 93
