I live in a flat with my friend who is a teacher. I am a secutery I work in an office for a travel agent. We are both good friends and we cook our own meals and enjoy it alot. I go and visit my parents quite a lot, about 3 times a week I have to go quite a long way. I've got a dog which I take out every morning before breakfast (becasue he is very lively). We live near the city centre so I can easily get to the shops and things. Sometimes at night my friend and I go out to the park ( which is near our house) and we play tennis on the courts there. Every Saturday we mostly go to town and look round the shops at clothes and for groceries. My friend is an infant teacher and she enjoys her job very much, I also enjoy my job very much.
