Every morning I wake up at about half past Seven have breakfast, and at about 8 o'clock set of for wok. I am the Assistant for a Reasearch chemist who is working a new rocket fuel, lighter 
than the present fuel, this fuel is for a rocket to mars, the fuel is to be a radioactive substance becaus the rocket will have a nucclear engine. today I am going to [observatory] to get some figures so I can work out how much fuel the rocket will need and how much it will cost. then I go back to the rocket institute in [city] my calculations will be checked and double checked for mistakes then we will set about producing the fuel. my hobbies include making model aircraft my present model is a meseshmitt, and I also like tampering and tuning my motorbike (A B S A) I also like cooking and my favourite dish is sweet and sour pork with fried rice. Sometimes at night I go to a chinease Restraunt where they have good wine but a very small dancing square when I go there I nearly always go with my fiance who is a reporter, she has a very nice personality and is verry modest. She dislikes my motor bike verry much and says when we get married I will have to get a car  Words: 227
