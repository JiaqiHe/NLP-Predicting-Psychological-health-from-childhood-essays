I sat down in the rocking chair drinking my cup of tea. I was now married and had two children a little boy and little girl They were called [name], and [name]. I lived at home with my mother. in the afternoons I went out to work. I worked in a shop just round the corner from where I was living. My mother looked after my children while I was at work. My husband also went out to work he worked as a long distance lorry driver. Often I wouldn't see him for two or three days but I was alright because I had my mother to keep me company and on the morning my children to look after. My mother recieved some money of me for looking after the children. My husb(and) gave me xxxx11 a week and I brought xxxx3 home so I managed easily enough. When I was away from work on sundays my intrests were reading and I would like to go swimming on a morning if I had time I sometimes took my children to the park and I enjoyed it very mutch. When my husband was at home we went out to the bingo and to the pictures. So my life is happy I hope it will be happy for the rest of our life.  Words: 221
