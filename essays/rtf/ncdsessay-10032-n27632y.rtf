When I have left Unniversity I want to settle down to a nice quite life I will get married and hope to have some children. I will take a job in town and keep to it. If I don't get married I will go to the merchant Navy like my Uncle [name]. When I come back on leave I think I will start making remote control aeroplanes and sell them. Thease models will be in detail* and at a scale. In the merchant navy I would like to go and learn how to drive a one man submarine. I would also keep my collection of stamps up, because you never know they might become valuable.  Words: 115
