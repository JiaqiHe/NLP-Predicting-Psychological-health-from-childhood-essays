I have a hair Saloon of my own and a few girls come and help me. So in the morningI have to get up and get the train and when I get there I open the Saloon and I have to put all the lights on and they all come in for apointments. When I go home at, Six o' clock I have to get my best dress on ready for the danse, because I go in clubs and I do ballroom dancing sometimes I take my children Ice skating and my daughter is Ice skating for great Britan. Also I take my sons to football lesons now they are both playing for Manchester United. I also am going on a big White liner to do all very well nown people to do there hair for all balls and dancing on the stage. In the morning some of the girls are there before me. I belive that are saloon is the best Saloon in the world the hair saloon is called [name]'s Saloon. Just across the road from are saloon there is another saloon calld [name] and [name]'s Saloon they never get any people in there they only get two or three and sometimes they get none in there saloon because they always charge people more money I never see anybody in there at all. I always seem to to have a very lot of custemers In because my people don't cheat people out of money because they do there hair properle. Not like [name] and [name]'s saloon.  Words: 258
