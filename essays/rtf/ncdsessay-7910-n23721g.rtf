I am 25 years old and I am a vet.
I get lots of sick animals (most of them arn't urgent)
I live in a small cottage in the country (I live on my own I have got a gerbil, cat, hamester and a dog for my pets. I have got a friend who owns a pony I am allowed to ride it when I want to.
I get home from work at 4 o'clock When I get home I do the house work and have my tea. My mother and father and my two brothers come to see me sometimes. 
Sometimes I am called in the middle of the night to see a sick animal (it is very tireing).
Most of the animals I look after are farm animals who get food poisening.  Words: 130
