"I am twenty-five years old. Today my football team are daying another team higher in the leaugue. I play at left half and so far I have scored seven goals. I have a son who is ten years old and he has a large collection of stamps. I often get him some stamps for his album. I enjoy helping my wife either in the garden or in the home. I also enjoy sitting in a chair and helping my son with his homework. I am going to the match soon.
     At the ground I met the manager ****. ""Hello **** you've got a good cheer so far. ""he said. You could hear the crowd cheering away on the terraces. I knew my wife and son would be at the match. The away team went onto the pitch and then we went on. We knocked the balls about and the referee blew to meet the captains. We won the toy* and we kicked off. We swept into the attack and then old castle, our opponents, counter attacked. Then they scored again. It was two - nil at half time. After ten minures we scored. I got the goal. Thirty minutes later we equalised. Then ten seconds from the end our winger scored. We won the game three goals to two. I joined my wife and when I got home I helped my son with his stamps. So I now had eight goals."  Words: 241
