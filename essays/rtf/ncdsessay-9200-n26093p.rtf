I am married and have 2 children. A boy and a girl. I have a job as cleaning flats. The stairs. in the morning, and a housewife the rest of the day. I take the children to the park sometimes. When the children are older and go to school I hope to take up the job I did before I was married. That is a secutaray. I used to love that. Although it was hard work. Sometimes I go out dancing with my husband and I have a very nice babysitter. The children are very good. They always do as they are told. I love playing with the children and they love playing with me. I do needlework of a night time making tea-cloths and towels. my husband often read's them stories of a night to make them go to sleep. My children are twins  Words: 145
