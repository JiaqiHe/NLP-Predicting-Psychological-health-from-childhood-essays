"Today I am twenty-five years old and I am going to by a new car for myself. The date is the (date). I am thinking of buying a red mini. The car will have to be red because it is my fovurite colour and it is a good colour for a car. My uncle is taking me in to (place) to help me find one. His car is a grey Jaguar with a lion's head at the fornt. Now we are at a car shop all the cars are displaid* in the window. When we went into the shop I started looking for a red mini. When i had found one, I drove home myself because I had a licence. When I had reached home my mother said, ""You are pretty good at picking cars!"" After dinner I said ""We cannot go out in the car tonight because I have to go to work."" My job is a fireman and we stay on duty all day long until we are off duty . When the alarm rings we have to put on our things and get into the van as quickly as we can , then we go very fast to the fire ."  Words: 204
