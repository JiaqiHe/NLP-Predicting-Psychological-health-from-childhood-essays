If I was twenty five I would not be married. I would be a stamp collector and go to the cinima once a week. I would have a libarary of books the books would be adventures Mysteries and Creepy ones. I would be a policeman and I would live in Newcastle upon Tyne. The house that I would live in would be a modern flat. In my spare time I would paint pictures for my walls and I would go on holiday in august to norway. My friend and I both like reading so he could come to my flat and read the books that I would have. I would have a car the car that I would choose would be a courtina. I would watch the television a lot I shall allways watch Blue Peter and OH Brother I would have a bg garden and a hut at the bottom and in the middle a pond.  Words: 157
