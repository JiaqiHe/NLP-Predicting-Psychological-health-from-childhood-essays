Now that I am 25 I have a job as a chef in a hotel near London. Sometimes we are busy and sometimes we are not. I have hobbys and my life gets interesting every-day. I find that when you are 25 life isnt so easy as it was at school. I play football quite alot and every Saturday I play for (team) which I liked ever since I was a boy. At home my life changes it is a quite life and the interesting thing I learn are good. I have not got a wife and I dont want to get married. My other hobbies are swimming and fishing Being a chef isn't an easy life at all because when you are busy you have to prepare meals the customers want sometimes they order meals which aren't on the menu so you have to prepare it just to please them. My work isn`t a very good thing because if the meal is bad you have a complaint and a shilling goes of your wages. I work between 6am to 11pm which is a long time. The pay is very good indeed because you get xxxx18 10, 6d a week, that keeps me giong for the week because I drink and smoke off hours but when you are a footballer you are not meant to smoke and dirnk. Sometimes some of my team mates come around like (name) and (name).  Words: 240
