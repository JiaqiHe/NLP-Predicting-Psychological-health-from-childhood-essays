When I am twenty five I want to be an art master at school I would take drama Nature History and art and I also want to be a Scout leader Sundays I would go fishing and most probalby set out the wwork for the next day at school. On fine days I would take my pupils out on a Nature ramble and things like that I would take them round the shorse of the south coast I would have a fishing club on Thursdays and a art and drama on Mondays and Fridays I would take the pupils to art gallerys and plays I would retire at forty five. Then I might take on a part time job like a traffic warden. I would live in a country Village.  Words: 130
