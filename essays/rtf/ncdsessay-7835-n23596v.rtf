I am now 25 years old, I like my work as an Electronical engineer. I have a nice house just out side Leeds, I like it where it is quiet. I am interested in stamp collecting and forien coins. At work we make radios and things like that, I have a wife and two children. Soon we will get a house further out in the country, then later I will turn it into a farm with lots of animals and hundrds of acres of land, I would get rid of my job and my main interest would be farming.
