I am at a school and I am teaching games, swimming and English. I take most forms for English except the first, second and third form, and I take all the forms for games. It is very nice at this school, they have nice meals. On Saturdays I work in a cafe and go to the libary at 2.30 pm. I am married and have no children and live in [town] where I lived for some years as a child. My house is a smallisj one and it had 3 bedrooms, a study, a kitchen, a frount room and a bathroom with a toliet. I have a car which my husband as well as myself drive. The car is a mini and it is blue in colour. The school that I teach at is a large school and there are about 900 pupils. I do not know all their names. There are 7 other teachers beside me. My homelife is a nice one, I have a homehelp who cooks my husban's lunch and does the weekly cleaning. She is very good and during my holidays she does not come unles I want her too. She also does my weekly shopping and in the evening if I want a cake she will go to the shops and get it. Every Sunday I go for a strill in the park and sometimes I take my camra and take a photograph of the ducks. On Sunday evenings I do some reading and get our tea and supper. I enjoy what I do. Some evening I bake some cakes. I help at the school's Garden Fate and sports day. In the evenings I mark the work my classes have done.  Words: 286
