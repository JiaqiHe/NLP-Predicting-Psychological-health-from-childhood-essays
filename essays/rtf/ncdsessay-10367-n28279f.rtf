I have two children and a wife my wife is called [name] and my children one is called [name] after me and on is called [name]. I get up at six 'o' clock in the morning to go to work. My job is an enginer and I start work at seven 'o' clock. I get my breakfast then go and get the bus my lunchtime is twelf o clock till one o clock. My finishing bell is at four 'o'clock. Then after I have my tea I am keen on gardening so I go and do a bit to my garden. Sometimes my oldest son who is ten years of age comes to help me but my younger son [name] can not help because he is only three years of age. My other hobby is takeing my dog shep for a walk I normally go to the country side but once I took him through the town to see how he would act he acted very normaly so I took him there again a few times more then we went to the country again. My wife does not work because she has to look after my son [name]. On friday night I bring my wages home which is twenty four pounds a week. Out of that I pay my depts then what is left I spend on papers and comics clothes the children's pocket money and things for the house and a bit to the wife and the rest for me.  Words: 251
