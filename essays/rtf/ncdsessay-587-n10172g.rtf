WHEN I AM 25 I SHALL STILL BE INTERESTED IN ANIMALS AS I SHOULD LIKE TO WORK IN A ZOO. I STARTED TAKING AN INTEREST IN ANIMALS WHEN I WAS ROUND ABOUT 5 YEARS OF AGE. I WAS LIVING IN A SMALL HOUSE BUT I WAS HAPPY BECAUSE I HAD PLENTY OF PETS, I HAD 2 RABBITS, 2 DOVES, ROUND ABOUT 40 GOLDFISH , AND MY SISTER HAD 6 CA*ES (GUINEA PIGS). THEN I MOVED TO MARGATE AND I GOT MOR* PETS. A DOG, A BUDGIE, A RABBIT, 8 GOLFISH, AND MY SISTER HAD A *****. I GREW UP AND WHEN I LEFT SCHOOL I STARTED A TRAINING COURSE FOR ZOO WORK. I FINISHED THE COURSE AND WENT TO (place) TO START WORK. I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO WORK IN (place) BECAUSE I USED TO SEE IT NEARLY EVERY YEAR. I STARTED OF LOOKING AFTER THE GIRAFEES AND HAVE WORKED  Words: 150
