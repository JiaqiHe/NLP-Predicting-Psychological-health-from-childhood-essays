When I am 25 years old I would like to live in a small flat, living by myself. Each morning I would get up and have a small breakfast before setting of to work. My job would be doing pension schemes. This is my fathers job and he gets paid very well. 
In my spare time I would set stamps in my albums. I would like to be a rugby player for Harlequins, which is my favourite rugby club. 
I would not want to be married because life would be a hectic. If I had enough money, for my holiday I would go on a round the world trip by aeroplane. Stopping at each place for two days. I would like to see horror films because when you are about 18 years old or under there are not any thrilling films.  Words: 141
