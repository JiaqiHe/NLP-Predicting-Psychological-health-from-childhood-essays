I am 25 years old and my name is ****. I have a boy friend named Christapher and I am going to get married in December. One afternoon I was sitting on the veranda when I saw Chris draw up in his sports car I ran down stairs as fast as I could to meet him, when I got to the front door I wondered to myself what is he doing here he should be at work. I opened the door and asked him why he wasn't at work he said they have given me a months holiday, so I have come to take you to Dover for the week so get your bag packed so when I said I can not come he said then I'll stay is it all write I said yes. After a while I said I've got to go to work he said wright of. I've changed my job I work at Aristoc now as a packer. When I come home I will laze about the house and then will go out for dinner to *lamboura good bye. When I got to work the personel officer called me into her office she asked me all about my home and interests. I said I have no farther and mother was living with another man and that my interests sewing and manky drawing but off the off chance she said have you a boy friend of husband I said boy friend but we are going to get married in December which is in a month. Soon my wedding day came and we were married we live very happiely together. Now I have got a baby 2 months old.  Words: 281
