My life at the age of 25
I am now emaganing that I am 25. I am not marred and live with my mother and father. I have to pay her for my food but I buy with the money I ern*. I work as a secatery in an office. I work for a man named Mr. [surname] who works in a bank. I start work at nine o'clock and stop a 12 o'clock for lunch. I have an hour for lunch which means I come back at one o'clock. Then I leave work at half past four. Then I go home for tea. I help mum a bit after wards and then I get ready to go out. At night I go out to the pictures with my boy-friend or anw where else. We are engaged and have arranged to get married some time this year. I work every day day of the week exept for Sundays and one day in the week which I can pick. I go out with my boy-friend and the family on Sunday afternoons. My boy-friend car is a Coretina, which is light green. The day in the week that I have off I help mum with the work and go shopping. In my spare time. I do some of my hobbies which are Swimming, Art and Studying nature. All so at nights I go to art school. That is on a Friday nights.  Words: 239
