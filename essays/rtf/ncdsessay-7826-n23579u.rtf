I hope to be at Collage and learning to be a sports teacher. I would be studying very hard at* home. Teaching mainly football and criket. At home I would be studying hard and playing games so I would know what moves to make in football then I could teach my pupels what to do and how to do it. I also would be reading a lot of books. I would also go to a lot of clubs that teach sport. Then when I am good at football I would like to play for a profesnel football team and make a lot of money. But I would still teach children how to play foot-ball and criket and swining and lots of other sports. And I would still go to clubs and learn moves that I don't know. Most of my spaer time would be taken up by training, studing and things like that. May be there will to some young boy's who what me to train with them and play football and criket with them. But if I counld not play football for a profesenl football team I would keep on teaching children sport. Then I would become a famous sport teacher and even travel all over the world. The I would become a manager of a world famous foot-ball team like England. I would stay on at collage if if I could not get a job an been a maniger.  Words: 241
