When I am 25 years old I will probobly be working with my dad who is a selfemployed painter and decorator. I should get about 18 to 20 pounds a week. I do not know who I will marry, but, I will have about two children, a boy and a girl they might be named after my wife and I. The make of car that I choose will probobly be a ford, possibly a for capri. I will get a house near the town for easy shopping for my wife. I will get quite good furniture, two comfortable arm chairs and a settee to match. In other words a comftable three peice suite, also two good tables and some ordinary chairs. I would have good carpets and wallpaper.  Words: 128
