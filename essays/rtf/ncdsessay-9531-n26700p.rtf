I am now twenty five an I live in (name of place). I have a lovely home, I am married and I have two children I am an explorer for rocks and minerals. My living is selling the minerals that i find. My main job is to see if the minerals are worth anything. i got to lots of place to get diffent kinds. Two years ago I went to burma and I brought back a sack full of rubies, Last year I went to Brazil and brought back a sack full of Emeralds. I was combing the beaches last week when I came across a diamond ring. In the past years years I have gathered up a big collection. Now I am able to sell quite a lot, But just collecting minerals is'ent enough one day I will run out. Tomorrow I am going to enquire to a job which you ern a nice sum of money, So I am going in for a scientist. I allready now a bit about chemicals, So when I was ready I went to the lond of the laboratry, and I enguired about it, in the end I got the job. I was working there for a few days when I was called in for repairing a crystal ball in which a piece of burning meteorite was and it had burnt its way out, I had to stop it or else it would make everything in its way turn up so I got a very cold material and through it over the piece of burning metiorite. There was a loud hissing sound as the metiorite burnt itself out.  Words: 275
