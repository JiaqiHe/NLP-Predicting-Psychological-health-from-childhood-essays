When I am a lone I would like to go for a drink at the pub. My house is in a quiet spot in the country just outside a village. The garage for my car is on the right side of my house, because on the left side there is my greenhouse for which I have all diffrent sizes of plants in there. My girl friend has blond hair and a lovely figear.
