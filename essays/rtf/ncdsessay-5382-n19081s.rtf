I am twenty five, I am not maried. I am still liveing with my fammily. I have got a job as a joiner. It is a good trade. On Saturday, when it is my day off, I go to the bathes. I am leading a very good live, and enjoy myself even at work. I have got a lot of monney in the bank, but I am saving it all up. I am saving it up because I am going to take my fammily abroard to France. I have got a mate called [name], he is a joiner too. He also is coming. I enjoy live very much. Another hoby I like besides swiming is tennise. I usualy go to a tennis court and play tennis with my mates.  Words: 129
