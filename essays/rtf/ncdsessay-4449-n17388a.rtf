If I was 25 years old I would start a job. I am a sical engeneer and I like my work. I am married and have 2 children and we live in [village]. my job is all about bridges moroways and flats and other big buildings. a sival engineers job isn't easy and it took me a long time to be one. At home it is nice and a lot better than being at work hearing the sound of drills and Bull dozers all day long. In my spare time I  go fishing to [town] and sometimes I go to a river or lake. My work is about 10 miles from home and It only takes me a hald an hour in my car.  Words: 124
