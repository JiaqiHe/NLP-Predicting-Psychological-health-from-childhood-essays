The Year is 1983 and I am 25 years old. I am a capentor. I have a house of my own and I am married and have 2 children they are twins and are both 6 years old, one is a boy and one is a girl. The work I do is quite good and I get 20 xxxx a week the work is quite hard but its worth it. On saturdays and sundays I go fishing because It is interesting. I have decided to change my job and be a bricklayar because the money is better. Bricklaying a hard job to and if it rains it won't be very nice. I often go and find grassnakes and lizards if its to hot for fishing. Some people say snakes re nasty slimy things but a grassnake is only slimy when it comes out of the water. The common lizard can swim to but it isn't slimy when it comes out of the water. A lizard is hard to catch because as soon as it sees you it scampers of. I have a guini-pig as a pet and he will bite if you tease him but he can be nice  Words: 199
