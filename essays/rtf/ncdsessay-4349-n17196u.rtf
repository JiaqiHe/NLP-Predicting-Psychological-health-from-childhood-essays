I would like to look after little children when I grow up, or work in a shop or be a school teacher. My interests will be when I get home at night I will go out for a little walk or have my tea first then watch television at night with some sweets or a box of chocolates. If I worked in a shop it would be a shoe shop or a sweet shop and I will be a shop keeper. If I was a teacher I would teach jornior children. But if I was married I would stay home on the morning and do the house work and on the afternoon I will go and visit someone or go out down towm, and do some shopping there with a friend or someone.
