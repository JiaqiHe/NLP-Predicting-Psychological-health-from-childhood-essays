One day I was in a panda car with my frind. I saw a man getting throught the window of a shop so we stoped and had a look when we got out of the car he got in the window very quickly so we foloed him in and he was not the shop keeper. So we got him into the car and took him to the police station and we found out he was a bargler. That night when I got home I put on the televtion and when the news came on I herd that we had coult a very inportent bagaler that night when I was getting my sper some one knoked at my door it was the sargent and he said the force thanks you very much.
