I would not yet be married, but I would hope to have a boy friend. I hope at the age of twenty five to have a job looking after animals. I would still be living at home helping my mother. I will lead a happy life and at that age I think I will just be thinging about getting married. I will be interested in fashion and the things going on round about me. I will have a large dog. Posable a Collie or a Alsatian. I will have a car. A rover 200 thousand if posible. I will have my hair long and I will buy what I want with the money I earn. I will also have a part time job as a libraryian in a public library. I also thing in my spare time at home I will design patterns. I would still like to be accayne*. friendly with the kids I know at the moment I hope at the age of twenty five or long before I will be able to swim so that on hot days I can go swimming. I thing I will get married about the age of twenty six. When I am married I hope to half a modern house with all the modern conveniences.  Words: 213
