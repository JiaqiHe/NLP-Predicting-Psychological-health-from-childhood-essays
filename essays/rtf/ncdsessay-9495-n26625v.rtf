My Name is [male name] and I am twenty five I am aiming to be a pilot I Have been up in a few I often glance at all the controls. I am at a training schoole for fliying we have test planes, and in our Spare Time we make little modles of planes I am Hoeping that When I am 27 I am a real piote on a Jet like the concorde. Two days ago I flew my 8th plane. But this one was a glider you flote threw the air like a Bird Just gliding. My wing comader is a very stritced man. We are a very Happy lot but sometimes fights break out and alote of men always get Hurt, but most of the time were all a Happy familly. Id like to fly a rocket to the moon and somtimes walk in space but first I Have got to learn to be a proper pilot like the men who fly the concord and the men that are going to fly the Jumbo Jet Sometimes We have to go to London air port to study the planes, and at london air port we have to get to know all king of langweges. The two I like the best are germenn and Sweedish I,d think switserlald is a beyty full place to go for your holidays.  Words: 228
