"     Today I have got to fly for a contest, it is a race 6,000 miles and I am going to try and beat the record my plane peeg is waiting on the runway and as I am checking my equipment the clock is tiking away quickly. 
     It is now 10 pm and my Jeep is rumbling over the tarmack towards peeg. Peeg is a plane with two wing engines and it has extra large fuel tank*.
     As the machanics put the engine cover on 1 dime in the cocpit is very small and there are controls all over it the door is slamed and the wheel**ocks are rolled away I start the engines with a few last waves peeg rumbled down the tarmack and lifted of the ground like a bird. 
     As I come over the sea night begins to fall and I begin to seel tierd ""only six miles gone"" I said to myself ""and another 5,994 to go"". The going is becoming harder and there is ice on the wings suddenly there is a funny noise and the left engine stoppes, the plane beggins to **obble but I can see land and crouds of people with flags ""this is the end of the race"" I said to myself I made a smooth landing and - got out to stretch my legs I went to the office and found that I had broken the re*ord two seconds."
