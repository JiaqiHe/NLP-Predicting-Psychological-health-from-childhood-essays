"In the morning I got up at 7 o'clock ready for my breakfast which was Bacon and eggs. After I had eaten I went into the bathroom to have a shave. After, I change into my suit and walked to the car, got in and started it. I work at the coast-guard. I have a speed-boat of my own which the top speed is seventy miles per hour. 
I drove into the road and my girlfriend was waiting for a lift, she works with me. I drove into the car park where my boss was waiting for me, he stoped me and I left my Girl-friend to drive. On the way he explained to me that a tanter loaded with one hundred thousand gallones of oil crashed on the rocks. I jumped into the boat a drove off, on the way I changed into the frogmans suit when I got there the ship was sinking. I threw the anchor in the water, put on my cinlinders and dived in the water, but it was too late the tanter lost its oil I swam back to the boat and went back to the coast. It took my work one day to complete our work. Before I went home for the night I saw the black seaside, I said to myself, ""If only I would have been quicker this wouldn't have happened."" I started the car and drove off home."  Words: 238
