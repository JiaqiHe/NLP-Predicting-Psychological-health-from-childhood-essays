I would go strait to from school work and get a job in a enjoyable factory Have a good time have football as a part time hobby. I would* get a relyable car (a large one) I do not know wether or not I will get married. I might go and stay in Ireland for a while and then come home again I would keep a few animals like a cat a rabbit a small white dog. I would have a telephone and a television I would still tinker with electronic equiptment. I would keep fit and not fat I would not vote labour or conservetive and not anyone. I might take up swimming as well. I have four brothers and one sister and a mother who like swimming and a father who was in the R.A.F. My brothers names are (in age order) Kelvin, myself, Timothy, christopher and nicholas and my sisters name is michele. I doubt if I will smok as it ruins your helth, and its a waste of money. I would wear up to date clothes but not the fancy stuff. I would remember my families birthdays And christining* I also would lead a good life I would keep safty first  Words: 205
