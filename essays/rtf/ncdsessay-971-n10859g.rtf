----------------------
I am a teacher and I am not yet married. My home is just a litlle cottage in which I hold tupperware parties. I often invite friends over and sometimes some of my pupils. I would like to get married when I am about 26. I sometimes go to clubs and I sometimes hold clubs myself. I go to bingo once a week and that is Monday. I enjoy being a teacher and often wish I was a Grammar teacher. The things I do most of all in school hours is writing. I do not drink or smoke because it is a bad way of losing money. I would not marry a gambler because it would make life a misery always giving money and maybe my husband landing in jail. I would really intend to lead a good life and not act foolish or get into trouble by the police.  Words: 150
