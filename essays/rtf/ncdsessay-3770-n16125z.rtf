----------------------
I am working in a large hospital in the country. I am leading a very helpful life. I am working as a nurse which I find is sometimes rather hectic I have to work sometimes in the daytime and sometimes at night. The hospital I work in is very clean and although I sometimes get rather tired I would not change my job. The matron although she is sometimes strict she is really a very nice lady. My home is a large house in the country verywell furnished and my interests are shating and reading and I love cooking although I don*'t get much time to cook. I got married when I was 21 and I have a daughter who si 8 months old hair name is Michaels. 
     My home life is sometimes rather interesting and sometiems rather dull. It varies quite a lot
     At work if I am working in the daytime I leave the baby in a nursery at the hospital, but if I am working at night I leave her with my husband.  Words: 177
