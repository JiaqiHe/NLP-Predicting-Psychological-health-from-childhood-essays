----------------------
At the moment I am leading a fairly happy life. I go to evening classes for drama, art and cooking. I have recently left an art school, and I have just got married. My husband is a drama teacher at a comprehensive school. I spend a lot of my time writing. I have a spare time job - illustrating childrens books. I don't like house-work much, except for cooking. I learn French and German. We live in a medium sized house in Shropshire. I love the peaceful atmosphere of the country. Books are one of the most important things in my life. I only do needlework when it is compulsary. My husband and I like to go to the theatre and concerts on our free evenings. Occasionly we go up to London for the week-end. The busy atmosphere is a striking contrast to the quiet life of the country. One day, we might go and live near London, but at the moment I am happy as I am. We have no children yet.  Words: 173
