My age is twenty five and I am a student at [town] college. I speand most of my time at college and the rest of my time is speant in doing my homework, and reading. On Sundays I sometimes go out into the country and speand the afternoon there. My fauvourite subjects  at college are English and Geography, and I am soon going to take a degree in English. At home I am saving up for a holiday, on my own. I have made my mind up to be a teacher, although I have to work hard to pass the examinations that I need to pass for my teachers degree. My parents are very helpful and encourage me in my examinations, and I have past several already. I read a lot of books to help ne gain more knolwedge and I hardly ever have any spare time to do anything else.  Words: 151
