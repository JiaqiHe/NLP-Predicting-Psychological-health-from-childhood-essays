Now I have taking up pole vault club at [town] and a football Training club for boys over 7 years old my only 9 year old son [name] come's here and is on his school football team. At home I like marking the boy's proJects on football and pole vault, and I receive 60 every month and they are all good ones as well 3 - boys of fourteen have passed the exam and are going to take up foot ball on a football team when they are 17 years old. It is better without my wife and I am trying to get a devorce when she comes out of prision. I have visitors for tea regularly and we chat about when we will have the next training* sesion. and I answer there questions and it is enJoyable usually When there is nothing to do.
