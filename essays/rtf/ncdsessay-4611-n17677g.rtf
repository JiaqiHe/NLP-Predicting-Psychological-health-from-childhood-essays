I have just quilified as a nurse at a new hospital, in my training I had to learn a lot and it is very hard work. I learn't how to cope with difficult patients, small children and babies. Ever since I was at school I wanted to be a nurse but I did'nt know if I would be able to cope. Now most of the hard training's over I'm glad I went through with it. I live in a nurses home and have a lot of friends. Sometimes at night we go to clubs and enjoy ourselves but other times we stay at home and study to keep us on top form. One day I hope to be one of the sisters and then a matron. I have other interests besides nursing I enjoy to go horse riding or swimming, although I'm not very good at swimming. My friend is on the same time duty as I am and we often meet in the hospital cafe at dinners time We have an hour but sometimes it cut short if we have an emergency. Nursing is a great life and I'm glad I'm part of it. Some people may not like it because they don't like to see blood, its not that bad really. I have been a nurse two years now a fully qualified nurse for only six weeks. It takes years of practice but its worth it in the end.  Words: 241
