At the age of twenty five I would like to work as a librarian because I enjoy reading books. My interests are cooking, walking, cycling and watching television. I would like to travel abroad and meet people for instance:- Germany, Switzerland and Belgium. I have already been to France and Spain and I would like to go again. I enjoy travelling by car and train but I would not like to go by aeroplane. 
When I am twenty five I hope there will be robots to help in the garden and around the house and other ingenius ideas because then I would have more spare time to do shopping in the early evenings and the washing and ironing and tidying the house. The other thing that would be nice to have would be an American invention which is a sought of box wityh knobs on to switch over to another channel on television which is near my chair. I would also like to have a colour television for certain programmes.
I would like to get married and have three children because I enjoy looking after small children. I think it would be nice to let them learn to swim like american children do when they are very young.
I would much rather have a white wedding than a reception and have two bridesmaids dressed in light green long dresses. 
After my wedding I would like to have a honeymoon in Italy where it is always sunny and hardly ever rains at all. The other place that would be most interesting is Australia  Words: 260
