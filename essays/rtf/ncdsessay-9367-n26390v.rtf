You see I am a hair-dresser, I go to work while my daughter goes to school, my husband [name] is on nights and he works at [company]. On Saturday I go to moms, but on a Sunday we all stop in, all exepet [name] and I and on the night we go to Bingo, mind you we never win anything excepet once and I won xxxx25 but that soon went. I like it very much at the shop doing all the peoples hair. Once when I was giving a lady a hair-colour I picked up the wrong colour I picked up white insted of black and the lady went mad. I do my childs hair and I do my own. hair because [name] and I both have long hair I sometimes do it in buns, ponytails, pigtails, plats and all other hairstiles.
