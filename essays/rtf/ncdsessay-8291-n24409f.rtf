"          Myself at 25.
I have just turned 25. I am a school teacher. I have 1 pupil called Joan who is very naughty. She is alwas playing tricks on me and my class Often I go up to the printing room for a few minutes and when I get back the class is in an uproar. I teach at an infant school just now, I am hoping to go a junior school next September. I have one good pupil whose name is Tessie. She is a very consiensious workers. Also I have a bad worker whose name is Dennis he is not in the least like Tessie. He is very timid unlike Jane and Tessie. In the holidays I am a student at ""Monk* Wood Experiments Station "" I work in the biologycentre. I study the growth and population of pond life fish and plants"  Words: 145
