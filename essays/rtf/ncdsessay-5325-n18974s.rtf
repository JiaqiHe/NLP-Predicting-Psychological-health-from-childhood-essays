My name is Mr Watkins, I am 25 years of age. I am not yet married, but I have a job as an Engineer. At the end of the week I get a fair pay of fifteen pounds a week. I only have one pet and that is a dog. One of the interests of life is cooking because I make specail dishes, of food. I am also intreted in the British 002 concorde because it can fly twice the speed of sound. Knext door to me is our neighbour who is 21 years of age but he has a girl friend to cook for him. Nearl every saturday I go fishing with my friend, my rod is 14 feet long and the line is 200 feet long. It is made of fibre-glass and is very strong. Once every two years I go on holiday to france Italy or Padstow. Half of my money goes in the bank every two weeks. The car that I have is an austin mini, the coulor of it is white. It can go up to 60 m.p.H, and it is a two seater. My real hoby is collecting stamps of all different countries, Polska stamps are vere big and coulerfull. I am also interested in history but im not very interested in Geography. The best country that I like Is Africa, but I have only ever been their once, and I have been on a safari. At home I have a radio controlled aeroplane but it is not ready for flight yet.  Words: 258
