----------------------
I would Ride horses and I would like to look after all sick animals. I would like to work at a riding school and teach young children to ride ponies, clean out all the stables and brush and get the ponies and horses all clean with a shining coat. I think I might get some of the ponies or horses razor clipped. Sometimes I ride a horse called sorrow and I look after a horse called Jasper who belongs to Mr [surname]. I would have liked to have a horse of my own and go out on the moors with him. When I am at home I would tkae the dogs for a walk on the moors. I would also clean up do some of the cooking.
