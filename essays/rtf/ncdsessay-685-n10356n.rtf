I am a man on the Coutsil but I am only a clarke I get xxxx23 a week and work 9.Oclock to 1 oclock and go back at 2 o'clock and come home at 5 oclock no Saturdays with the job. I only have a little way from work to get home for it is only two miles away from where I work.
      I live in a priait house with a big back garden I keep a few pets and grow some vegtables I have a wife and one child who is five months old and is a boy I have some black*rannt bushes, I also have a car, with a garange fitted to the house where I put the car and a three bedroom house with a coal fire and two elcetric fires.
      On Holidays we to Cornwall sometimes but mostly we go to our parents and take the child with us. Once before we went to Wales for one week, and there was only one wet day but that was only a* shower so it was nothing to worry about we go out shopping on Saturdays and we go to friends once a fortnight. We keep some goldfish for breeding and selling.  Words: 204
