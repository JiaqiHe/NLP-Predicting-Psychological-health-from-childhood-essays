I am now a student at [school name] Primary. I take on music, mathematics, games and history. I live in [city] and come to stay here for eight weeks. My father works in a printing works. My mother is one of the helpers at the [city] library but only until i've finished teaching at the school. My name is [female name] incase you would like to know. Every Monday after play I take games we play (in games) dodge ball and take it in turns to go on each piece of apparatus. Tuesday in the morning as the same on Monday I take history. We are now writing about Christopher Columbus. [female name] found out quite a lot about Columbus from a junior Brittanica. Thursdays we do music in the afternoon after play. We did some recording on the tape recorder about the animals in the wood. [female name] read something about the Owl. This is what she said: I think that Browl Owl got her name from the Owl in the wood and Brownies got Brownie because the Owl is brown. And that's where we got the brown uniform. I also in the music lesson have the recorders playing a piece on their own called the Sixth Suit. Friday morning I take mathematics. They did graphs and sums. The graphs they did were about pets and percentages. At the end of the three weeks we did a Varitie Show. [female name] played her electric organ for the wedding and [female name] sang Vienna Woods on her own.  Words: 258
