Every morning at 8.30am I set of for the office. I am a draughtsman, I design prototype cars at a Fords branch. I get to the office at about 9.00am and I am there all day untill six thirty. When I get home at about 7.00pm I sit dow and read till 7.30pm when I watch the news head lines. After it is over it is usually time for my evening meal which is prepared by my wife. In my spare tme I like to go fishing. My favorate spot it just by the bridge over the river (town). I find that unless I am patient I don't catch much. The most fish I have ever caught in one day is six medium size bleek. Also in my spare time I like to go swim-ing. I go in to (place) at least once a week where I swim for about three quarters of an hour. My favorate thing to do while I am at the baths is to practice diving. I am now able to dive from sixteen feet into a depth of water ten feet deep. Often over the week end I like to go down to the local football club for a kick around sometimes we play diferent towns for charety On these occasions we get quite a fair turn out Every sunday at eleven o'clock my wife and I go to church and after dinner we usually work in the the garden welding, cutting the grass triimming the hedges and genrally tiedying up. This fill my week up.  Words: 261
