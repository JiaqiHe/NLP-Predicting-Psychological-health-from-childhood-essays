----------------------
I am a teacher. I have just got home from school. I teach a 2nd year class. I enjoy teaching as I like children. I am not yet married but I am engaged. In my spare time I share it between cooking, tidying, reading, and relaxing. 
I usually get home about 5,o.clock, I live with a friend. Her name is [name]. We were both at college together but we are at different schools.
      I have quite an unusual class Sometimes they are good, sometimes bad. 
      When I am married I will leave this school as I am going to live in a house in [county]. 
I will still be a teacher but I will be teaching elder children. I am looking forward to that day. I will still come back and visit the children though. People have been very kind in the way of presents and I will miss them a lot  Words: 153
