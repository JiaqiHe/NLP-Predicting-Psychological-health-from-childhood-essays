I am a proffesional footballer so far I have not had much success I have scored ten goals in 3 seasons of playing with Leicester City I like do odjobs around the house when I have time. I have very little time at home because I seem to be always at training. I go on holiday about twice a year when I can get away. When I was small I thought it would be nice to have a lot of money but my money maters are turning out very hard. I am intrested in other countries and other cities when I can I like to watch the television. The thing I remember most was when I was still at school was when we won the [town] junier schools league and I scored our goal that year I was our top goalscorer with 9 goals. When I retire I think I'll try to be a manager of a football club. All I can think about is my one ambision was to play for Leicester city and England. I used to sit on the wall at [street name] street every now and then when I could go with my friend and his dad.  Words: 201
