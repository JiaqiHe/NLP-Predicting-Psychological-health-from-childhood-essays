I am now 25 and I am training as a Doctor. I want to be a Doctor because it is very interesting. Such as doing operations and checking people over makeing sure there is nothing wrong with them. In my spare time that is when I do get any I am in the laboratry trying out chemices and so on. I do get a fair amount of time at home. At the moment at training you are always practiscing on dummies. Sometimes if we are lucke we can check people over but that isn't very often. Some of the instucrts are very nice but some a very sturn. At times we get flims on how germs form and how to get rid of them. Sometimes these germs can be very dangerous if they get in a wound. That is why hospitals are clean. If it is a very bad wound and it has go poinses it will be operanted on straght away. Doctors sometimes have to take risks wheather it is worth while to operant or not. Some operations are nothing at all like appendicts or something like and braking and resetting an arm. But some can be as hard as anything. We have lectures that last as long as 10 minutes but at times we get them as long as 3 hours but it usaul is about an hour. Luckily I am coming on very well in training it will only be about another year then my training will be finished.  Words: 252
