It is hard to Imagine. that I would be 25years old. But I would get married and have children. And when they go to school get a two hour job . And Just be writing some Letter's out in an office. And have a Nice home. And keep it clean And look after my children and husband. And give them a good meal And dress them in good w*Rm clothes And keep them woRm And get paid well and do other interesting things Like being a gardener. and Learn them to grow up proply.
And get my husband to get a good Job. a get paid well. Then we would go on a Holiday.  Words: 113
