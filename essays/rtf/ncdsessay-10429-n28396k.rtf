"I am now living in the London Suburbs and I share a house with my wife and two children. I am a a school teacher and I teach 7-8 year olds. The house we live in is a bungalow in a quiet road in North London. It has a large garden which is spread all round the house. The garden is an orchard and a lawn combined at the back. And in the front there is an adequeate lawn for the children to play on. On the out side of the lawns there are large flower beds. attached to the side of the house is a shed where I can make models and work. The school at which I work is a large one with an ancient house beside it. It has a large gym next to my classroom from which I can hear my class playing about and setting up pranks my class is a happy one with a ""ring leader' who is a very charming boy called Jimmy Johnstone. I am still interested in handcrafts sports and I am an assistant leader to the local cubs. On sundays I go to a Crusader class which I help lead.
