My work is a nurse and I enjoy my work immensly. The other nurses and doctors are all very kind but though I have been three years at college I know I have still a lot to learn. I share a room with a nurse called (name) who helps me a lot with my studies. In my spare time I sometimes go to dances but although I enjoy my self I would rather be doing my embroidery at my room in the nurses quarters. My work starts at 10am and ends at 12 midnight during this time I have many jobs to do ** such as changing the beds etc etc The patients can sometimes be awkward but mostly they are quite kind. I would rather work in the childrens department than any other department or ward. Especially when I have to look after the babies we have to cook and fend for yourself in the nurses quarter but at night a moniter comes round to see that our lights are out and that we are in our bed. although we do not start at the hospital till 10Am we have to get up at 9am to get our breakfast and housework done. last night (name) took me to a dance which I accepted. Lucklily I had my black ****** dress which I was able to wear with my gold stole shoes and gloves. Thus we had a succsessful eveening I **** the doctors from the Hospital.  Words: 247
