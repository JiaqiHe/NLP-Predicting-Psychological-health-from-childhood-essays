I would like to be an ordinary house - wife and take swimming lessons in the afternoins. at a school, to help the teachers.
In the mornings I would get up at 7.30 am. and make the breakfast. Then the children would come down have their breakfast, go and get washed. while I clear the table and wash - up. When they have both gone, I tidy up abit then get out my car that is an 11,000 then i would go and do the shopping. When I would come back i would do the washing put it out to dry. Then get the dinner at 12.00 am. That would give me time to get down and ready for swimming. The first lesson was at 1.30 p.m. Then the next lesson would be at 3.00 p.m. After that it would be 4.00 p.m. I could have a swim if I wanted one. Usually I would have a swim. When I get home I would get the tea. The children would of been at home. After tea both children would go to guides at 7.00 pm and cubs at 6.30 p.m. Then I would sit and watch telly. When they came home they would have a hot drink and a biscet then go bed until the morning. Then ** would go to bed ready to start for another day.  Words: 227
