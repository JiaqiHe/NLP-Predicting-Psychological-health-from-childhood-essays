If I were twenty five, this is the life I would lead everyday I would do the housework then I would go to work I would work at an restruant. I would start at 10 o`clock and finish at 3 o `clock then I would go home and do some baking. I would then make the tea and sit down and watch the television. The next day which is Thurs-day is my day off. I then would go out on my hobby which is bird watching. I sit and listen to birds singing. each day a thrush comes to my window so I give them  some crumbs and now we are great friends. He takes me each day to see his mate and her eggs. They will soon be hatched. Soon I would have to go home again to make the lunch. Then I would do some sowing for my sisters dress, dolls, I have made nearly all the clothes for them. Then I would watch the cookery programme on the telvision. Then I would go up to (place) to do some shopping. I would go for something to drink and eat at a restruant when night came (name) and I went out to the bingo together. after-wards we went to the hotel for something to eat. We went home in my car. I had won the snowball it was xxxx100. So my husband and I (name) and her husband would go on our holidays.  Words: 245
