I am married, I work work in a childrens nursery, every afternoon except saturday & Sunday. I make my own dresses, & knit mine & my husband's jumper's, I am a Tawn'y in the brownie's, & I take some of them to do their badge's. I cook most of our food. I invite my mother & father to stay the day on sundays. I often make clothes for brother's children. I am very interested in the brownie movement and I often take them to historical place's & place's of intrest, & also on picknic's. At home in the evernings I usually watch telly or read. In the holidays I like to invite my brother's children to come and stay with us for a week or two. In the Christmas holidays I invite a the family to came and stay the night & we have a buffa, & drinks. I like to visit the cinima about once a month.
