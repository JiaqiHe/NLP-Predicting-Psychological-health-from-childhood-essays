I will keep trying at collige until it is time to leave then I wil get a very good job and get married. Soon it is my 25th Birthday and I am getting very excitted. That night before the day of my birthday I couldent get to sleep so I decided to make plans for the following day. I decided that I would take my wife to **** and then to a place on the coast. I thought of **** but that was a bit to far away. Then I made up my mind we would go to york because thats where I lived for a bit when I was small. The next morning I woke up my wife gave me a super presant it was a Philips electric razor. I told her what we were going to do. When I told her she was very excitted. We quikly went down stairs go our Breakfast and packed a picnic and set of. we arived at **** at five to eleven we had a very good time there then we set of for York. We a arived the a seven oclock and booked a room in a very nice hotel. I can never forget those three days. Now I am nearly 26 I have still got the same house in **** and I hope to stay there a lot longer I have got a job as Bank manger but I still hope to get a better one All the poeple who work at the bank are very nice I will I will be very sory to leave them if I do. I have been very happy in my age of 25 * hope I have the next year just as happy  Words: 290
