I think I might be married and have a baby. While my husband is at work I will be doing the housework and looking after my baby, who is having teething troubles. If I have any spare time I read a book or a newspaper. We go to mum and dads at least once or twice a week Sometimes I have to get up in the night to see to the baby. If I don't hear the baby crying then I expect my husband sees to it and soothes the baby. Every morning except Satuerdays and Sundays I get up at about half past seven to get my husband and the baby their breakfasts
On Satuerdays and Sundays my husband gets up and makes us a cup of tea. Satuerday mornings, after I've washed the dishes, I take the baby to town and do the shopping for the week. Sometimes I meet a friend of mine and stop for a cup of coffee in the closest coffee shop.  Words: 167
