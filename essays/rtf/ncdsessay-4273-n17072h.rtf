I have to get up at six thirty in the morning for my Job. at a building* site nearby. I am a crane driver and live in a small caravan, which is towed from site to site by one of the companies vans. Every night I have my main dinner, because at dinner-time I don't have enough time to prepare a proper dinner. My work ends at six and I usually* have my tea, then have the telivision on till ten oclock, then go to bed and read. My hobbies are stamp collecting and coin collecting. (Both of which I started when I was a boy).  Words: 106
