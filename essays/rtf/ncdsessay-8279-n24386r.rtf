I am twenty five years old and I am married. My two children who are twins are called [female name] and [male name]. They are three years old and they are always out in the garden. [female name] has got a three wheeler and [male name], a pedal car. My husband, [male name] has been to university in America and he qualified for a doctor there We live on the outskirts of London and I am very happy living here. If want to go for a walk in the country we only have to drive a few miles and we are out in the open air. We don't live in the dirty smelly streets of the middle of London either. 
Next door lives a brother and sister called Michael and [female name] they are three and four year olds and very good friends of [female name] and [male name].
