My birthday has just past and I am now 25 years old, this year I think I will get marrid and I will go for my Summer holidays on the QE2 to Austrailiar. On Sunday I am going to get marrid that is tomorrow. I wake up in the morning and I put my best suit on, and go to church, when I arrive at church my new wife is waiting for me. Then we go in together and we get marrid. After there was a big celebration, There was Shandy and there was a big wedding cake. After the celebration we went to bed 
Next week we went to Ausraliar. The sun was shining and it was very hot in the afternoon when I got back I went to bed.  Words: 131
