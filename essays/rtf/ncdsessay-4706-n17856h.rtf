"At the age of 25, I am a teacher at a Primary school, teaching childeren of the ages of seven to ten, I teach History and English and with the younger childeren, any General subjects. I have just left University and I am a student teacher, I have taken ""O Levels"" in seven subjects and am waiting for the Results. 
      I live in a modern flat with another student teacher who is at the same school as I am. My main interests now, are collecting stamps, a childish hobby but it has been proved to be profitable for I have in my collection, a few valuable stamps.
      My parents live about twenty miles away and most weekends I drive down to see them in my small Morris Minor. There I relax, occasionally riding, and going for long walks, observing, birds, flowers, plants and wild animals. On week-days I usually stay in my flat and watch television after marking books I have bought home from school. Sometimes my fiance takes me out to the cinema, at which I watch thriller films or nature films.
      I have to economise on food and luxury goods, for I cannot afford them on teacher's pay, nevertheless I lead a very full and happy life and I am completly content to stay as I am"  Words: 220
