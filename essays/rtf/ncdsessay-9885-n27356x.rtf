----------------------
I go to school in the evenings. I work as a nurse but I want to go further. I still live with my parent and I don't think much of marrying. In my spare time I go visit friends (and perhaps relatives). I have my own room in which there is my pet budgie Handsome. I work in a babies ward as I love them very much. At school I'm taught how to heal burns. at the moment, I later plan to work in an ambulance. I am very upto date and like modeling which I do most of my spare time. I still live in England but I would like to visit many other contries. I live in one of the beautiful houses which there are in this area. We have a beautiful garden which my brothers make very farm like (by planting vegetables in it.). My two nephews and three nieces are very sweet although always making a mess. My brothers don't live very far off and often come. My older brother [male name] in an engineer and my younger brother works with computers.  Words: 186
