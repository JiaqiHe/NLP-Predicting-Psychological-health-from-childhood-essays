I am now learning to be a chartered Accountant. My aprentiship started off by running erands but now I have started to learn how to become successful at my trade. I work for a very popular Stock broker. After another year of studying I will become a qualified stock broker. I still live with my family, but very soon I am going to rent a flat, nearer to my job. I play football with a Sunday League amature club, and I enjoy it very much. My sister will be geting married in a month or two, and we are busy preparing for it. I am to be best-man. Every night when I come home from work I take my dog, Rufus, for a walk. He is a big, handsome Russian Wolf Hound. I am very pleased with myself today because the boss congratulated me on how I have improved since I started my aprentiship.  Words: 154
