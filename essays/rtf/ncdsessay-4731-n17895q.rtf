----------------------
I am studying at a university now. I am trying to pass some exams which involves my whole future as a chemist I am doing my best in the working time and trying to get the weight off my mind in my spare time which I enjoy by playing sports. I am staying in a flat which is not far from the college. The work is very strenuous but rewarding and I am learning more day by day. I am interested in my work but it is occupying my time greatly. The little time that I have left I spend on meals and on sports as I would like to be in the college football or rugby team. 
My interests are my work and the sports. I would like to be a chemist in a university and even have an office If I get on well enough which I think I might if I do my best at my work, taking in all I am told or find out. In sports too I must do my best as I would like to get into a team. I am getting on well and I have high hopes for the future.  Words: 199
