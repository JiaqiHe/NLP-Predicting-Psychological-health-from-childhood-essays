When I am 25 I think I will be a nurse and I might work at a Meternity hospital. My interests would be French knitting and I would proberly keep on with French. I would by an English French, French English dictionary. I would read a bit and I would sew in my spare time. I think I might learn to drive a car and then if we had enough money we would by a caravan. I would go swimming a lot also. If I got married I would most likely have a baby. If it was a girl I would call it [female name] and if it was a boy I would call it [male name] or [male name]. We would or I would like to live on a bungalow or cottage or if not one of those two I would live in anythinge else like house or flat. I might get married with primroses and some ferns. I think I might have a big wedding but I don't know where. The little cottage would have a thatched roof and there would be lovely flower and some wy* around the house. There would be a few cottages standing side by side in the country so our children would have friends to play with. The children would have a bike and shed to play in. They would go all over the country on their bike and they would pick flowers A farm would be near the cottage and we would get eggs a butter and milk and more things from it. I think this would be a nice life to lead and it would be very quiet.  Words: 277
