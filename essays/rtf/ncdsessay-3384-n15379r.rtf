"I am 25 years of age. My hobby is reading. I have a few years left a college because I want to become a teacher. I am very interested in children their ways and means of doing things. I have a good home and my mother and father are proud of me. I have been engaged for over two years now and we are planning to get married in May. He is also a student at the same college as myself. He is called [name] Right now he is waiting for his results as a teacher. My abmition was to be a nurse but I couldn't watch other people suffering. When I gave up nursing my father said, ""Why don't you go into a factory"". I wanted to think about this because I wanted to make something of myself and so I decided to be a teacher. Right Now I am learning French, Spanish and Latin. I hope to be a junior teacher and a very good one. My grandad hoped that my father would become a teacher one day but he never did. He had brains and still has but not enough. I said to my mam one day, ""Why didn't you become a nurse,"" and she said, ""I wish I had"". You see my mam can do the things a nurse can do."
