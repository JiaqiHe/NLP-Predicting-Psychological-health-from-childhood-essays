I have now professional job as a engineer, I have a son of three called michael. My vincent a convet 50 *** is going well and I go quite a few V.O.C. meetings which I thoughly enjoy. Some times I go in the car with my wife, but usually I go on the co*et. I went to the woburn V.O.C. rally where I got a badge with woburn 1983 on. I saw the old fashioned Honda 750 four cylinder. I entered my vincent in for the old bikes competion, but won nothing. Althogether I enjoyed it very much. The 35th Daily express trophy race was jolly good though its a pity Frank Gardener has retired. It's nothing like as good without him. At the moment I've got a three bedroom house, but it has only asmall garden. I've still got by me**ano set but I rarely use and it's the same with my scale*tac, which are both very expensive now.
