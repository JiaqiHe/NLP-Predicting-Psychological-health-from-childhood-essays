"I own a car, a Lamboughini Muira, and I still live in the house I am living in now. I like watching football and cricket. I am not yet married, but I am going to be engaged in 6 weeks. I am still thinking about my proffession. My ambition, to own a Lamboughini Muira, has already been accomplished. I watch television every now and then, and I have the radio on quite a lot. I have plenty of friends, and enjoy myself when I go out with them. I have a pet dog. One of my friend's is a stock car driver, and he is entering the semi-finaks next week. My cousin [male name] is already married, and has two children, both girls. My car has a fitted radio, it is auto matic. I am not very good at cooking, but I manage to make my self reasonable meals. My brother owns a triumph G.T.6.Mk II. He is going to come with me for a holiday in Majorca in the summer. I am not superstitious, but I believe in ghosts. I don't think that ghost's are evil, instead, I think thay a as scared of us, as we are of them. One of my friends has just published a book called ""The man with two head's."", and it is selling very well. I go to bed about 11.30., and get up at 8.00am. I wear modern clothe's."  Words: 237
