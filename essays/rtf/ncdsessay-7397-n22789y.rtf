"To-day it was a great day for me because I was able to do the plans of a building it was the first building plan I had done. It was of a house in [village] and it was to have five bedrooms three of these would have double beds and the other two would have single beds in them. As I drove through Penzance past the gas works and over the swing-bridge where I saw two boys fishing, past the dry-dock where I saw a ship called the Bellfry having repairs, across the prom where yesterday waves beat over the top of the prom soaking the road and up through the town to the office. When I got into the office one of the office workers siad to me ""You're early to-day [male name],"" and I replied
""Well I've got a lot to do to day"" after I had taken off my jacket I began to climb the flights of stairs soon I came to my little room where I do most of my work. In the room there where twelve deferent shade's of pencils there was one drawing board some rolls of tracing paper two set-squares a big ruler and some odd scraps of imformation and some pieces of paper that I was to be made into my first plan. When I had finished after some long tedious hours I took it to my boss to see if it was right and when he said it was very good I could have jumped around the room.
The next day I was sent to [village] with the builder. It was a long journey we went over many hump-back-bridges across bridges and down hills and then soon after that we arrived and explained to the builder something he didnot understand a few weeks later the people who where going to live in it sent me a check of 50 pounds payable to me arrived in the post and after that I thought that's that over and done with, I hope business keeps on going like this."
