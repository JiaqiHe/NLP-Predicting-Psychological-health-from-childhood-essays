Ann is in hospital at the moment appendasitas. tomorro she is having her appendics out, I am not worried though because every operation done at that hospital has turned out well, when Ann gets out of hospital we all will go on a two week holiday exept for my husband for he has to look after the farm. John which is the mane of my husband wants isn't left out compleatly for when we come back w* he'll go for a weeks holiday. 
     I do not work out because all my time is taken on cleaning the house making dinner fpr are* farmhands as well am my family also my money time is taken up on miling the cows and going shopping. 
     Now I will tell you what sort of animals there are on my farm pigs, horses, cows, sheep, and a sheep dog out dogs name is patch for he has patches of black and white all over him. We have a very big garden and at the bottom of it theres a river that leeds onto a lake that runs through the park that is about a quater of a mile out of town. on the lake there are ducks and swans that sometimes swim up the river to the bottom of our garden where we feed them.
