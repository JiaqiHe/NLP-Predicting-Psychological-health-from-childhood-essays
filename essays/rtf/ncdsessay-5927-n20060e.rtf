I live in the country now with a husband and two children of ages 1 yr and 2 yrs old it is quite a walk from the shops but it is all right. My husband is working in a shop down the road. I make most of my childrens things and my own clothes I do a bit of gardening now and then. I draw and paint when I am bored. At night when the children are in bed a will sit down and do a bit of sewing and talking about the childrens future. Somestimes I will go with my husband to the cinema in town and ask my next door neighbour down the road to babysit until we get back. We have a car so we visit my mother and Father every Sunday afternoon. I cook all the meals in the house and dust and vacum the house unless I am ill. My spare time is with the babies. 
      Before I was married I was a nurse careing for babies in a hospital. Then I started to go out with one of the assitances of the hospital and then we where inkadged then after 6 months and gave up nursing. I was married and we went to live in the country with my husband and at the age of twenty four I had my first baby and then at twenty five I had my next baby. So now we live in the country happy eir than ever before.  Words: 251
