On 14th April I got up at 3 O'clock to be on the padie bus, to go to work on the buses. When I got there I got me *aybill and got on the number **** bus which goes to ****. After a hard 8 hours work on the buses. I got home and had my dinner and felt much better. I then did my ironing and went out shopping. At three o'clock in the afternoon I took the dogs out for a walk. One* of* my* dogs name is Tramp, he is a Manchester Terrier cross. He is two years old and black with white marks on his chest. The other ones name is Dandy he is a Scottish Terrier and his also two years old. At 8 20 o clock I sat down to watch Oh! Brother. After that had finished I switched the television off and again took the dogs out for a walk. When I came back I put Tony Prince on. He is one Radio Luxemburg. At 10 o'clock I went to bed, to be up at 3 o'clock next morning. My interests are pop music and dogs.  Words: 193
