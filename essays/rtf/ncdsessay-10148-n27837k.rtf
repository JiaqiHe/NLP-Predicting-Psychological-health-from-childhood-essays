I have been to a University and have studied electronics and I am now building electronic equipment such as, equipment for space rockets. I am living in a flat with a friend of mine who goes to work about the same time as I do. In my spare time I go fishing or build things from my electronics parts and on wet days I sometimes read. I enjoy my work very much and I get good pay. My parents are both healthy and the same with my brother and sisters. My friend and I go out in the evenings with girl friends and enjoy ourselves. I am saving up to buy a little bungalow out in the country. I have a car which is sometimes goes wrong but it is ******* to get in to place. When I have been fishing I have caught quite a number of fish. I caught a 4 1/2lb cod last week which I had for tea. I have my own private plane and I like taking people for trips. I am leading quite an easy life and at my work I never really get bored I work from nine in the morning to 7 in the evening. I like building electronic games for me to test my skill against and I find this very amusing. I play chess and once I built an electronic chess player and it beat me. My friend and I go out quite a lot together and two years ago we went on holiday together to Spain.  Words: 257
