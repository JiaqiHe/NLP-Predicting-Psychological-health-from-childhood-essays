I live in a mansion and I have got two pools for swimming. I am a aeroplane pilot and I fly to many foreign countryies. I own a collection of old aircraft. My wife and I sometimes go on trips to the Antarctic, and study the wild life that live there, some of the penguins are quite tame. I have left the airport and I have joined the Air police and I am on the track of *ome theives who have stolen ten thousand pounds worth of jewels.  Words: 88
