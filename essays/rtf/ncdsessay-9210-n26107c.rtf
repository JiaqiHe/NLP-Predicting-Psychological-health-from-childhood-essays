I get up every morning and have breakfast. Later I go out and climb into my car and drive into the town. I stopped outside my studio and walked in. As I went in I picked up the mail. Their was a letter asking me to photograph a wedding at the local church. This will be a routine job for me because I usually do one a week.
At two o'clock I arrived at the church. The wedding was to be at 2.30. I loaded my camera and attached a flash gun. At 2.15 the bride and bridegroom arrived and the ceremony commenced. 15 minutes later the procession came out of the church. The bride and bride grooms relatives and friends lined up. I took the photographs and came home.
That night when I got home I had tea and went out to a dance with my girlfriend. Later I went out for a meal. After we had had our meal I went home and to bed.
The next day I would be going fishing, my favourite sport and pastime. The biggest fish I ever caught was a gigantic pike.  Words: 187
