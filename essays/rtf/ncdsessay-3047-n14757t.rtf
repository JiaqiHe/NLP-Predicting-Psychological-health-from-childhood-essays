----------------------
at the age of 25 I had a very busy life. I have Been a phisiotherapist for four years, and daily work at the hospital Between 9-00 - 4-30. My patients range from (Ruby Rugby) football players to people with polio.
I am married, But I have not got any children yet. I live in a flat with my husband in (town). We have been married for two years some of our interests are the same.
We both enjoy playing tennis and swimming. The club we go to has tennis and swimming facilities. I still have my stamps, but I do not have much time for them.
I make some of my own clothes through knitting and sewing, I have greally improved and I quite enjoy it. Two nights a week my husband is late because he teaches evening classes, so I have a chance to make them.

I still like to read books, Deramis Wheatly and agtha Christi are my favourites and I ofen Road for an hour at a time if I have a good look.
I have entered several swimming and tennis competions. They are only minor onez and do not matther. I have come first in swimming and third in tennis.  Words: 200
