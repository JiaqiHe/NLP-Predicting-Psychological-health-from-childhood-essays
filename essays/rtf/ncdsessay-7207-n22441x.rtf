----------------------
My life at 25.
My name is Mrs. Jones I am twenty-five years old and I am married. My husband is twenty-nine years old so there is not much difference in our ages.
His job is a school teacher in a grammer school. I have now got a place at a teachers training college for I am as keen as my husband was to teach. I would like to teach domestic science and art if possible in a junior school. As you can see for yourself I am the sort that is interested and enjoys doing practical work where-ever I am.
I had my first baby only two and a half months age. The babies name is [female name].
We have many pets in our family since both of us like animals. We have three cats, two dogs a puppy that is only two months old, also an aquarium of fish.
On summer evenings I take our baby to the park in her pram before she goes to bed. We live in Surrey near London which is very near my home town.
We have some friendly neighbours next door to us and very rarely an argument.  Words: 190
