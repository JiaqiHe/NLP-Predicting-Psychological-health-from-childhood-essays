----------------------
I am now 25 years old, my home is in Guildford at a place called [area]. My interests now are fishing and shooting, I still go sometimes to the same places as I did when I was a little boy. I shoot now at [location] N.RA ranges and I am not doing to badly this year. My house is an old tudor place, it was pretty horible when I first moved there, but with a bit of hard work it is now very pleasent. My mother and father are still living at the same place, my job is at [company name] with [company name] in [town]. I get quite a good salary for a person of my age, and I like my job very much. I spend quite a lot of my home life fishing and shooting, and often go fishing with my father like when I was small. I am not married but I have a nice sports car, sometimes in my job I have to fly up to Scotland or Ireland for a meeting. My job name is branch manager in which I am in charge of a small factory near Lowestoft. After I had left [school name] I went on to Leeds university to get a degree and luckely I got one in Latin. I hope soon to go on a trout fishing holiday in Devon on a small river I know which has plenty of fish in and some big ones to. It is on a moor in about the middle of Devon.  Words: 257
