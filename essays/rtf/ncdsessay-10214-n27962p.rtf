would be a reasearch scintist with a wife* and tro children, a boy and a girl. I would smoke, or drink, that is except for tea and coffee etc. I would have a smallish semi detached house at in the country some where and a ford anglia car. I would not watch* too much television but just a little bit and I would go to bed fairly early. I would carry on my stamp collection with the joy of my school days and I would play footbal in the goals for our local side. I would go to night school two nights a week to keep up a good education. I might go to football matches once a month to watch my team leeds, probably at home. I would like to take a holiday in the sumer in France and practice speaking french although I would still eat English if at all possible. We would camp once a year for about a period of a week each time. the campsite usualy on the yorkshire moors, the woulds or the pinines. I would perhaps do a little wrestling in my spare time but on a full time training programne. My attitude to life would be j ust the same; work my best and take my Jen in chockolate etcetrc. I would make model boats as often as possible in my spare time for the amusemunt of the rest of the family as well as myself. My life would be of exitment and joy for me and also for the other members of my family.  Words: 263
