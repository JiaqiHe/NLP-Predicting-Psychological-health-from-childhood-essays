My home is not to good and I am not married and I live with my Mother and father. I will go to collage for 1* year and I will be like all the other sailors I will srub the decks polish the brass and eny other thing to get to be a salior but I must listen to whet the teacher does and what he says but first I must no how to do these things but the ship has to be an big ship and a fighting one. I am not going to get married because it is to much. but first I was not going to be in the navey I was going to be in the army so I packet the army in and went to the navey and now I am stopping in the navey. And I hope I will get a captian of a ship or even a corpral of a ship and I will sail around the world with my cruw and one day I might get the captian of my own ship and some day I might go to places with my own cruw and even get a bigger ship and sail oll over the place and to do a good deed  Words: 241
