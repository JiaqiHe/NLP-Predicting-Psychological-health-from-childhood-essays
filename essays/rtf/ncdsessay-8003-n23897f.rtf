When I am 25 I hope to be a farmer I will have a farm of about 250 acres of land for sheep and crops. I will have a large farm building in which I will rear beef calves. The calves will be sold, when they are ready, for beef the crops will be barley to be crushed and given to the calves as eriel and the rest of the crop will be grass to make hay. For my hobby I hope to have a sailing yought and in my spare time go for short holidays on it. I would also licke to play chricket.  Words: 105
