I am going along in life very normaly. I am now working as a police man and I have hardly any time for relaxing in the spare time I have I study and do odd jobs. If I only happen to be working nights I go out and borrow books that later will help me if I decide to leave the police force. At the moment I am thinking of leaving and I am going to join the army. My reasons for wanting to join the army is that in the army you can get around much better. A month has passed now and I have left the police force. This morning I am going to see the army officer about what I will have to have. Well I am in look the army want a person just like me. but I can't start for another month and I am just about to get married the time is next Saturday. Well my luck has run out my girl friend won't marry me if I join the army because she says I'll never get to see you. Well Here I am driving a tank in the army. I have a bit more spare time now and my inrests are now fly ing and making model aeroplanes.  Words: 215
