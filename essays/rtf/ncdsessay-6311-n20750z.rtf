I like Gardening and I keep it nice and neat my car is a second handed one but I hope to get a brand newone. I need a car to get around a bit because evry other weekend I go of to the sea side. and collect sea shells from diffrent places. and my favourit holiday spot is the Islo of Weight. I first went there when I was 5 and been several times since. There is one sea side place I dont like that is blackpool because when I went there I had one of my baby teeth pulled out. It his my holiday from collage so I can do what I like. At the moment I am fixing a plug for my mum at collage. last time I was on my holiday my dad showed me a lot of things around the house I like playing foot ball so I went in a field to play football with my friends and had come along to be referea welost 2-1 but it was agodd game altogether My friends like playing billards and snoker so Im learning to play instead of keeping the score The friends of mine are alway playing sports so I have to learn them aswell  Words: 209
