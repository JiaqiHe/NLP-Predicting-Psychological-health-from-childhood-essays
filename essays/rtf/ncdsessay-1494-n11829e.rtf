When I am twenty-five I would like to join the merchant navy. In my spare time my hobby would be model cars. I want to become captain of a ship. If I cannot join the mer chant navy I want to be a customs oficer (in ships, not aeroplanes). In some of my spare time I would play Rugby Union or football. I would like a house somewhere in Sunderland near [park]. I do not think I would join the army because my father was in the army and he told me about it and I do not think much about it. On Saturdays I would go to the football match and support Sunderland. I do not think I would get married. If I played football I would like to be centre-half and if I played rugby I would like to be hooker.  Words: 143
