I am a sales girl I work in a Sweet Shop. I live in the middle of the country. I have to go to work in my car. I find my work very enjoyabell. There are all kinds of costumers Mr [name] is very nice but he is a bit shy on the other hand Mrs [name] is very catty. I like working in the Sweet Shop because I like children very much ( I have one child of my own) nerly every morning about ten children come rusing-up to my conter some times they stand there for about ten minits. My live at home is completly diffrent as soon as I get home I have to cook my husbens meal. On my days off I do most of the house work. It is so different at home than in the Shop because I hardly see any body at home, but in the Shop I see people all the time coming in and out getting diffrent kinds of Sweets. In my spare time (which is hardly any) I do a lot of knitting. I also like making toys for my son. Are house is very old and has big black beems. One of my faveret pisce of furnetcher is the big old oak chest it has three big draws and to cuberds. One hobey of mine is flower eranging. The pets we have are tomis the cat, fred the dog and mac the fish. The only thing I don't like about fred is that he is always runnig over my flower beds. Once I Spent an hour over one flower bed and fred ran right across my plants.  Words: 278
