I am an airline pilot I hardly ever see my wife. I work with BOAC, and fly UCIO's all over the world. The money is very good you get about two hundred pounds a week. My house is big but I never get to see it. When we fly to places like Japan we have to sleep there overnight and at some of the stops on the way. Sometimes I am away for a month or two. But when I do get home I always enjoy it. I play a bit of am*ter football for a small club when I can I have a nice wife and two children both boys. One is three the other 18 months. Our house is quite new and so is everything else in the house. I also have recently bought a new car. I am a keen supporter of **** and go to all the home matches I can, as well as a few away. Sometimes on a Sunday I go out with my wife and children, or we have visitors, but mostly, I like to Sunday free so I can do some work around the house or in the garden altogether my life is very interesting and I see a great many countries and new places, but I could really do with a bit more time around the house.
