At half past seven I get up and get ready for work. By 8 I am out of the house and going up the road to the shop. My job is hairdressing. Today is Friday tomorrow will be saturday no more work until Monday. On a day like Friday we get a lot of customers.
      On saturday I get up about 8 and have breakfast. I tidy up the room and probably to a bit of dressmaking. After I would perhaps go to the nearest shop and get something for dinner. Later I would get a 10d bus-ride up the town and have a quick glance at the bargain counter. I'd go and get a chiken for sunday dinner get back home and do some reading until tea.
      Sunday morning up early to go to church. After church I would go home and get ready for dinner and have an afternoon all to myself.
      I live in a flat withe my friend I am married but my husband is in the army and at the moment is out near the equator. We will soon be getting a home. My interests are dressmaking, reading books, going to different places abroad and watching television.  Words: 202
