When I am about 24 I hope to get married. and when i'm about 28 I hope to have one child which I hope will be a girl and then when i'm about 30, to have another child this also a girl. After about another year I would like to start work again and carry on till I retire. Mummy said she wants me to go to language college so that I can be an air hostess. But i'm sure that will never come true. When my children are about 2 to 3 years old I would like to go to Spain for a few weeks. I would like a little cottage near the beach. when my child is about five years old it will start school and when it is 7 it will transfer to the junior and when she is 12 to begin her secondry education and when she is about 17 I would like her to start work By this time I'll be about 46. I would like to have a caravan so that my husband my children and me could go down there at the weekends. When my children were about 7 I would get a dog and some giunea pig for them to keep as a pet. I would like to live somewhere in Brighten. where my children could enjoy the sea. And if I could'nt I would like to live in a country cottage near a field of cows. I can always remember when I was small. We went to Eastborne for our holdiday and when we steped outside the backdoor there was fence and then a field of cows and every morning the cows came up to the door for some bread.  Words: 289
