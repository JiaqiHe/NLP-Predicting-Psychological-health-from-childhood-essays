I am a captain in the army. Some times you have fun but other times you have fights. You mostly stay in the camp. But some times you go abroud and have comando training. I do not go home much. Some times in the army you get but badly. Other times you can go on a ship or a plain to overseas. The comando training consese of going down a rope on a palee* you bangge a person then put them on a stracher and get pold across the river. My work at 25 years old is very tiring and very good.
