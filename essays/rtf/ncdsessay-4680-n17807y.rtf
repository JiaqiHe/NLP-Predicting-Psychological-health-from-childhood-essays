I go to work every day at 9 o'clock. I am leading a very good life and I earn quite a lot because I have a good job. My main interests are playing Tennis at Week-ends and I still live with my parents who are not like some parents who stop their children from going to parties or staying out late with a personal friend.
I also go out alot with my boyfriend. We go to see some of his friends sometimes or we go to see my friends. Quite a lot of times we go to a small quiet restaurant for an evening meal.
I am hoping to settle down at a school permanently soon to teach instead of going from school to school for about six weeks, as a student teacher.
Then I will move into a small flat, so that it will be easier to get home and I think I might get a bit lonely but then I could share a flat with another girl.
In another year I hope to get married to my boyfriend and we'll go to Spain for our honeymoon and I hope to have 2 girls, for children.  Words: 193
