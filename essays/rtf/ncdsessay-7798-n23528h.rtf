When I am twenty five I hope to be a pilot of a Tridend passenger aircraft and go to differnt countrys and be enjoing myself. My interests  will probally be new planes like the Boeing 747  and football. My ambition is to breed collie dogs. I will probally have a wife and children and be very happy. I would most like to go to America and Canada because I have relations there that I have never seen before, my uncle who lives in Canada has a big boat 60 feet by 15 feet and keeps it at Vancover. And he sails it in his spare time but every year he takes along curise in the Pacific. I should like to see him If I get my own way I will have a fast sports car and a big house. If I am not good enough to be a pilot I would like to be a proffenall footballer.  Words: 157
