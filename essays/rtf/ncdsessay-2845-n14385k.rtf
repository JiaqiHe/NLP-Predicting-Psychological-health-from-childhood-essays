Well, If I 25 I would like to play football or help out with a club for a couple of quid. Not could a get money from that but be a busman. The type of bus I would like to work on M.B.S, M.B, M.B.A and X.M.S which are new buses. On these buses no conductor is needed for these are O.M.O (one man operatied). 
      If could get a better job such as a D.J I would. Better still would be a reporter for a news paper. With that job I could go all over the place.
      A even better job would be previewing sport for Grandstand. 
      At home a would watch T.V and before a leave I would listen to the radio. I would like to make models. 
      On Saturday a may be working or previewing or watching a game of football. Sunday I would go visting or working maybe. Of course I could always have spare time. There would be new things to learn and if I'm a busman I'll know much more then I do now. I would know all the controls and how they work. It would be a very Intresting job. The other jobs may be intresting too for being a D.J means you can play all the records and 1 or 2 hours out of a day is time for work.  Words: 230
