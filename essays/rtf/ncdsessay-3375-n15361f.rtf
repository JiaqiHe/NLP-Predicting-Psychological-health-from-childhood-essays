I would be interested in aniamal's and would care for them but I would not like to be a vet because I would not like to cut animal open or anything like that. I have had thee or four dogs a cat and a bugie. in home life I would like to be a painter and dekereter my dad used to be one and he liked it. Wallpaper last's for about a week or so. but being a painter and dekereter is not so easy as you may think you have to be good at measureing the wallpaper. and I would save up for a car alot of people need acar to go to work in and some for holidays and things like that I have always wanted a to get to place's in and to go to work. in the summer I would go for a ride in the country side.
