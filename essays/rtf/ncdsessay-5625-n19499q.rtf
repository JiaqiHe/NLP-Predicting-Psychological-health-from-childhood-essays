----------------------
When i am twenty five I would like to be an infant teacher. I would like to teach in (school).Thirty would be the number of children I would like to teach. In my sparetime I would like to train horses, read or work with animals. If at Christmas I had time I would have a party for my pupils I would also like to have children of my own.I would employ a nurse to look after the children while I am teaching. If I could afford it I would like to have a car. A car would take me home from work quicker.When I got home I would take my children out for a walk. I would then go f** a hack on with of the ponies I had broken in. I would make the tea, when i came back.While I was waiting for my husband to come in I would correct any books that needed correcting.After tea I would put the children to bed.When i was finished that I would help on the farm.When I came in I would watch the News and then go to bed.
If I did not qualify for a teacher I would own a Riding-school. I would buy a small farm and turn the sheds into stables Ten ponies would be all I would take. I would have classes everyday except on Sunday.I would have three classes a day in summer but only two in winter. If there was someone who wanted a lesson on their own I would try to fit it in in the af ternoon.I would charge 51- an hour. I would also like to own a jumper and compete in local shows.
