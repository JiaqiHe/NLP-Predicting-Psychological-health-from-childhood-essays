I am now 25 years old, I want to be an airpilot and fly to spain and other countrys and I will be married and have some children. I hope and come home and see my wife. I want to if I could just fly to the moon and just see what it is like. To see the moon, i'd love too see it, or else if I could'nt be an airpilot I would be an doctor, or specialist and work in a hospital. Because I think that people could be saved from all these deaths. But they just havent got all the tools and I think they havent got enough scientists to invent these tools or to make them. So I think they should have more inventors.  Words: 128
