I am now 25 years old. 5 years ago I left university and am now married and living in a detached house near [town] I am just completing training to be a civil aircraft pilot and work for [company]. If I had to pass the various tests ect by [company] I might join the RAF. My wife is just about to have a baby, so I am staying at home to look after the housework and do the cooking. As my wife goes out to work as well as me we are quite well off for money. When the baby has been born* we will start saving up to by a more expensive house, and then we can settle down to an easy life rearing our child.  Words: 127
