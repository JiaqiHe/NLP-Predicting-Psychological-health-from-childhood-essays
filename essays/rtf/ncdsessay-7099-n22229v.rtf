If I was 25 years old I would get a house by the sea and live there with my mother and father. I would work in a toy shop near my house. I would go fishing before my breakfast nearly every day and when I come home from my work I would go fishing somtime when I come home as well. I would not work on a Sunday. I would go to church on a Sunday morrning and on the afternoon I would take my mum and dad a run in my car if I had one. If I never had a car I would play a game of football or a game of tennis with my friends. I would go my holidays to (place) and live with aunt.  Words: 129
