I am 25 years old and I have my own house to look after. Everry day I do the house work to keep the house tidy and clean.
Sometimes during the day I have to go out shopping to buy all my food. Then sometimes in the afternoon I might have a cup if tea and a biscuit. then I would get the tea prepared. about seven o'clock we would have our tea after that we would wash up and sit down and watch telavison for the rest of the evening.
At the week-end I might go out. On Saturday I might shopping then have a meal in a resturant then might go for a ride in the car then go home. On Sunday we do the garden and tidy up the house as well. Sometimes on s Sunday we might go for a ride in the car after tea. We enjoy it very much. then we come home we go to bed.  Words: 161
