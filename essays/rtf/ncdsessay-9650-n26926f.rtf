Now that I am 25 years old, and responsible for my own problems I find life isn't as easy as I thought when I was young. When I was younger my main intrest was animal welfare I have still got my intrest and I have a pet shop which I give beauty treatment and some kennels. I have not much spare time for homelife or holidays I am still single but I hope to get married soon and maybe have children but they might take up alot of time. so I am not so sure of having them. I am living with my parents and we are very happy together my father helps with the dogs because he is like me we both love animals, when I was younger I had pets of my own and I would look after them very well I was very busy looking after them but I enjoyed it very much because they gave me pleasure and happiness. I have two dogs of my own one an Afgan hound and the other a Greyhound the Greyhound win's quite alot of races for me I have cups that it has won for me I put the Afgan hound in shows  Words: 204
