WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE 25
I have just left my training college and ready to find a job of Teaching at a school:  Games, English (LIT) And the Arts.
I do not smoke for it might affected my sport and rarely drink. I would try as often as I could to help boys from my school out of school hours. As I like Sport myself I would aways join in with them when ever I am wanted. I would not poriculy like to be concerned with the Town Council or be a manager of a Hotel or an owner of a shop. But I might be an owner of a shop selling would sports gear for I find it very boring trying to sell a babys toy.
I wouldnt get married until I had settled down with a job and started to rent a flat about a mile away from where I worked. But as soon as i had ea* some money and was living nicely I might find myself a wife. If perhaps I just decided to change my job I would have my own CRICKET school for the boys in the winter, summer and Easter Holidays, of  course I would find myself a *ate to help me run it.
