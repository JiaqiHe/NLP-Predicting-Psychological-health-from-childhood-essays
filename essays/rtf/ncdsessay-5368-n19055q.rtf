My Life As A Frogman     I am now twenty five and have joined the navy as a frogman. I ann happy and finding the navy very interesting. When I have my leave I take my raido controled aircraft onto the moor to fly them. If it is a wet day and I can't fly my aircraft I go swiming at the nerest swiming baths. I have outher hobby's like making little aircraft to fly on the moor or making a little toy to give to my child. I am marryed and have one child called [name], he wants to be a frogman when he grows up but he is only three year's old and has a long way to go till he can become a frogman. It is an interesting life beng a frogman and dangerous. I am not allways going under water I have to help with all my work like keeping the ship kleen and tidy, it is not easy being a frogman. I have been to many a place in the world, some places I like some I diddent sonne sunny some cold but all interesting.  Words: 189
