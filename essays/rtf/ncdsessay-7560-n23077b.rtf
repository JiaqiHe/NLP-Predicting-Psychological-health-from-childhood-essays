I am living with my mother and father. I help in a shop. I like doing that very much. Or sometimes in the summer I help my father. I am already married with one child. When I am not at work I look after my child. My interests are to have a shop of my own and to have three more children. Two boys and two girls. My husband and I are trying to get a house of our own. and a new car. My mother has given us some money, and with it we will buy a car.  Words: 99
