I am a Ballet teacher I have my own day school and I teach Ballet, English and Art. I am not married but I have adopted 3 children 2 boys and 1 girl. I also collect and specialise in stamps. My children are aged 4, 3 and 2. I have a maid who looks after them while I teach. My two little boys like football and my little girl likes Ballet. My school is called [school] and their are 50 girls and 45 boys. We have 2 dogs called Mitzi and Fritz we are all very happy and are like one big (happy) family. My days are very busy and full but I am doing what I have always wanted to do my four hobbies Ballet, English, Art and Stamp Collecting. And I hope when my children grow up they choose a job that keeps them happy and busy.  Words: 149
