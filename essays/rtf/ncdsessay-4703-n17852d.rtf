I am in the Royal Marines as a drummer. It is a good life with marvellous pay. In the Marines you are allowed to follow many interests, my main ones being Boating, canoeing and swimming. You are taught to be a good marksman, as well as play the drums, in case you are called up for active service which at the moment is not very likely. You play at the Lord Mayor's Show along with other regiments and ceremonial parades, the big one being Trooping the Colour on the Queens Birthday. Six weeks paid leave every year is allowed for every Marine. When I come home on leave I am always greeted in a most uncivillised manner by the children [name] and ]name] and in a more sedate manner by my wife. The children always have some presents. [name]'s present was a book on the history of the modern army from 1914-68 and [name]'s was a nuses outfit. Now to get back to the army. After ten years I have risen to the rank of corporal and when I am a sergeant my pay should increase by 35%.  Words: 188
