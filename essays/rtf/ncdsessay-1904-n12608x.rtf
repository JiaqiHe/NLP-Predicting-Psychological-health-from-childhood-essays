I am now twenty five and I am in the navy. I am not married so I stay at home with my mother and father. I prefer the navy because I can learn more things about diferent countries. I donot see my mother or father much because I am out at see a very lot. At the moment I am on my way to Australia to collect wool. I have been to a lot of countries such as Africa, Nigeria, America, New Zeland, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, India, Jamaca and Germany. It is hard work in the navy because you have to scrub the deck carry cargo off and on the boat. When we get back to England we do a lot of training. We go back home to see our wives or mums and dads, this is the best thing because this is about the only time we get away from the sea. I like the sea myself exspecialy when the sun is shinning. I like it when I am working on a passenger eruser. I donot like stormy weather* because it is very hard to work you keep on slipping and slidding about the deck. You have to do a very lot of training.  Words: 206
