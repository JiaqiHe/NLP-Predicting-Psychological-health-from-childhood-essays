I am working to be a Child Welfare officer, as you see, I enjoy working with children. At the weekends, I occasionally have time to go swimming, or play tennis on the local courts. Sometimes I get very little sleep at night, but I eventually make up for this. I also attend a University one day a week. I sometimes have time for pottery which I do in a small shed in the back garden. This I enjoy very much and have always been fascinated by the way pots are moulded. The rest of the week is spent cooking meals, washing clothes and tidying the house. During the holidays I go water-skiing with my husband, or skiing in switzerland. We have a small cottage at [xxxxxxx] [illegible] in [xxxxxxx] for the Easter holidays. My husband is a mechanic and often comes home filthy. Also in the holidays we go hostelling with our child, Anne, strapped firmly in a bag, on our backs. As you can see, we are an energetic family because John and I both like sport.  Words: 178
