I am now 25 and I have Quit a nice job. I sometimes get fed up of doing the same thing every-day and long for the week-ends. I have Quit a few intres for Instance reading Anenture books going out with my freinds, helping my mother do cooking and other exciting things. I also like week-ends becouse in the mourning I go to shul and In the after noon I go to a movement called [movement] which I enjoy I also like a sunday Afternoon becouse I have the whole after noon in which to have all to my self. After work sometimes I go in to a cafey to have a cup of coffee but I don't enjoy it nuch becouse of in my work thier are not many people that means young so often I think like* changing my job.
