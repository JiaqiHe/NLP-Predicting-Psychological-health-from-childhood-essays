My life at 25 years old. My name is [name] and I am 25 years old. My husband is very nice but I do not see him very much because I am a nurse and I work in the mornings and at nights. I have to children 1 boy and a girl they are at school. I have been a nurse two years and I enjoy it very much. I work at [town] hospital. I meet a lot of nice people at the hospital. I work at the childrens ward because I like children very much. When I am home I like to tidy the place up a bit because it is always in a mess with the childen. and I always have to make the beds and put there clothers away for them. When the children come home for school I have to make there tea in a hurry and then go strat back out again. on Wednesdays I go to a old lady to see how she is because she has just come out of hospital and she still is not well enough to go out in the streets yet. I do not work on saturday's and sunday's but some times I am needed there. If I am not wonted I go out for a walk in the county with my husband and children. My mother and father live at [town] and in my spare time I go and see them my friends that I was at school with sometimes comes and sees me to ask me how I am getting on at nurseing. and I ask them the same thing. My job at the hospital is to wash them at night and in the mornings it is to give the people there pilles. I have very many more thing which I have to do as well.  Words: 309
