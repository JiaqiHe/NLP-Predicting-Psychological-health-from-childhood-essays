"My job is an electrical engineer. I have to look after motors and electric machines I am married but do not have any children. My wife is one year youger than me. Last week one of my mates at work was killed when he received a severe shock from a live wire. 
I play football for a junior side called ""[town] United"". Last season we were in the final, but, ""[estate] Thistle"" beat us. Ialso play tennis and rugby. I am also a member of the Sub. Aqua Club and in summer we go to the sea for a weekend. We use snorkels, masks and flippers although sometimes we use aqualungs.
I do not smoke and I do not drink, so I can save quite a lot and am hoping to buy a house. If I can't buy one I am going to build one one myself but I might get my cousins [male name] and [male name] to help me. I live just now in [street name] St in which new houses have been built. 
About ten years ago the Americans became the first to land on the moon and next summer I am going by rocket ship to see Mars."  Words: 201
