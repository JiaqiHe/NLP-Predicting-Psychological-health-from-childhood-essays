I am twenty five years old and I work at home I have got two children a girl and a boy and two dogs they are both beageles, I tack them for a walk evrey morning, and dinner time, and everey night. I get up every morning and get my breackfest and tack the dogs for a walk round the block and then when I come home my husband and children are ready for breackfest and when they have finished then my husband gets the car ready and then they are off. When they have gone and the dogs are asleep, I have to wash all the dirty socks and sherts. When I have finished I have to wash all the plates and then I can have a rest.
