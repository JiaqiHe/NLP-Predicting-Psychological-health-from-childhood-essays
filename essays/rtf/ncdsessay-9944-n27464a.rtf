One day I had to go on holiday for a week . It was hot actaully a holiday because my job is an air hostess . I had to go away to france and stay the week in a hotel . When I told my husband (name) about this he wasn't very pleased . I soon fixed it up with the company and they said I could take my family with me . They were all very pleased espiacally the kids . When we got there we thought it was great but soon wished we were home again . When we got home we were all very pleased to get back into the old rou-tine . We liked to get up as late as possible and make our own breakfast . all our intrests seemed more exicting and enjoyable . I had liked to *otter about in the garden before we went away and enjoyed it even more , wh-en we came back . after we came ba-ck we decided to have a night out to celebrate our home coming . We all enjoyed this night out and the kids liked it even mrore. (name) our eldest daugher was glad to get back to school and down to some hard work as was (name) and myself .  Words: 217
