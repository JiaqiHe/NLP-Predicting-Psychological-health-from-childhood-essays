My name is (name) and I work with my Daddy on television I have a show of my own called (name). It is a childrens programe, I try and get famous people on it **** even the children them selves to sing, act or dance and Daddy help's me he plays the piano for the children and we have a sing song.
Sometimes I am asked on other peoples shows to sing. It is very hard work but I enjoy every minuate of it.
My mother was very helpful when I started. I entered a competition and the winner would appear on television my mummy made the beautiful dress for me.
When I appeared f on television this man was so pleased with me he gave me a show of my own, and as Daddy works on television we came to be a duet.  Words: 141
