I am now 25 years old. I have a bob as a hair dresser. I get to know alot of people. & my friends often come in to get their hair done. I live in a house at [location] and have to walk 1 1/2 mls to get to the town where the hair dressing shop is. I am interested in my work and enjoy doing it. I also enjoy swiming and needle work, they are my main hobbies. I sometimes go to visit people in a my car. I do not smoke or drink. I have a little dog I call it Tich as it is so small. I like animals and looking after them. I often take tich for a walk. We have also got a fish whitch we keep as a pet. The fishes tank has to be cleaned out once a week. We have a big garden it has a lawn and a path there is also a green-house whitch we grow alot of tomartoes in. I am a keen gardener. As well as growing out-side plants I also grow in-door plants. I like to keep my house tidy. I have a two bedroomed house the spare room is for when I have people staying for a holiday or over the week end. I buy my clothes from a catolouge or I make them my-self. Somtimes when I have nothing to do I read, I borrow the books from the public libarary. I often get books on needle-work or gardening. Somtimes I get books of storys. (fiction). For my holidays I often go abroard to Spain or France.  Words: 272
