I live in (town) and I have a job at the chemist. And I am married I have one child at the age of 3 months and it is a girl called (name). I often go swiming and I hope that I can go in for the (name of place) Swiming gala. My husband is not well of but just right and he works in an office in (name of place). We have just moved into a new house as befor we were living with my father and Mother in a bungalow in (name of place). the house is quite big with three bedrooms which are very roomy my Mother paid for some of the house as a wedidng preasant but we havent been able to have it for a couple of years because the site was not ready but now we even have a garden of our own which was a great relief because (name) would not had eney where to play. I have just been offered a award for giving away a prise for the disabled to give them more pleasure instead of just sitting about all day and I am very pleased while I am at work my next door nabour looks after (name) until I come home and she enjoys it very much I often take her out for walks on Sundays and she enjoys every minute of it. We are soon going on holiday to france and so I have to brush up a bit on my frence or I wont know where I am. we are going in a few weeks time so that gives me a break to do some shoping at weekends when I am not working in the shop. We have a car which moves us about quite often and we are very lucky I would say to have such agood life.  Words: 311
