I have two children their names are [name] and [name] they are both 9 years old. my husband works on ships cleaning them and keeping guard that no children go near them, I am very much interested in animals I always read books about them they are mostly books from the library I sometimes go out to the pictures and I get a baby-sitter who lives over the road from me I often watch television but most of the time it's off I always knit a lot and sew. I cook a lot too but it's not very succesful, it either turns out burnt or crumbly*. My husband likes drawing and painting he was once asked to sketch a drawing of a horse and it turned out very succesful he won's one a certificate for the best painting, well I just wish I was a little girl again.
