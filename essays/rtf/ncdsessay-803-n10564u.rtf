I would like to live in a bungalow at one end of the zoo with a nice garden all fenced off from the public Inside the bungalow There will be an observatry, a study, 3 bedrooms, a Dinnery room, a lounge, a kitchen and bathroom etc. I shall have a caravan changed into a mobil inquiery office and go all over Great Bretian advertising In the zoo I will hope to have a Killer Whale, Dolphins, a flying dis play of egals etc., Preforming seals, chimps tea party, Parots party, and Mountains for sheep goats etc to have for grazing. Some countrys I hope to go are Africa, aMerica, Austria, Germany, New Zealand, Australia and India. (I have not yet thought what part of britian I would like to be in yet.)
