When I am 25 I think I would like to work in a garage. I dont know if Women can do this, but I dont see why not, I wodnt like to fill cars up with petrol but I would like to mend them. I'd like to do this because I enjoy takeing things to pieces then putting them together again. In my spare time I would like to do some painting. Also I would to do rideing. I would like to have lots of animals in my home including animals like doggs and cage animals like rabbits, hampsters and perhaps some birds. I would live in a large house With a very big garden. The garden would be used for the animals to exercise in. The house would be somewhere in the country. I would like to learn to drive. If I had any more time I would like to own a stables. It would only be a small one and not very expensive I would have about two horses and three ponys the horses would be a ordinary black one and a palemino. The ponys would all be dapple. They would be welsh mountain ponys.  Words: 197
