At the age of 25 I have a wife and one boy. I think myself very fortunate to have such a kind and considerate wife. My boy is only two and is very pretty. Unfortunately being married I do not have much time for pleasure, but when I do I go fishing.
      As to the matter of home life, I am very satisfied and as I said before I consider myself to very lucky.
      I am an assistant manager at a bank and this is a high position for my age. When I left university I applied for this job and out of five hundred applicants I was the chosen one. 
      Yes, I must admit I am very happy with my family and my job and if I can continue like this for the rest of life I will be extremely pleased.  Words: 143
