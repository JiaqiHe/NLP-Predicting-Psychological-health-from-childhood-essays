"It was my 25th Birthday and I thought everybody had forgotten. I was very surprised to see my wife with a cup of tea and 2 rounds of toast* brought up. ""Goodmorning and many happy returns of the day"" she said I said thank you ate my breakfast and got dressed.
      When I walked down I saw a bundle of presents all for me I was very happy then for even my little boy [name] had not forgotten. I went work and had a lot of cards from all my mates.
      When I came home I said to [name] my wife ""I'll take you out for the night"" ""But what* about [name]"" ""I'll take [name] as well"" I said so we all went out to a pub were we had some drink out side.
      The following day I went to do a swop for my corsair I swoped it for a Sunbeam Rapier which was capable of 120 mph.
      I will always remember my 25th birthday as I enzoyed it more than my 21st."  Words: 174
