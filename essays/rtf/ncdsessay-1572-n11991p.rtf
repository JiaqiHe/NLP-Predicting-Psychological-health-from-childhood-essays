Every morning at half past eight I walk to the bus stop ready to go to the bakery where I work. I would work hard all day bringing and fetching bread from upstairs in the little shop. Serving customers, taking things to their tables, wiping the tables and emptying the ash trays would all be part of my job. All morning long I would work hard at my job and when break came I would sit down, have a few sandwiches and cup of coffe then start work again. I would work as hard as before and when five o'clock came I would finish my job, pack up and go home. At home I would make the tea and sit down in house. As soon as my children go out to play I would go to sleep for a few minutes. When I wake up I would watch the television for a bit then take up a book and read. When the children come home they will get ready for bed and then go to bed. Soon after that my husband would come in tired and hungry. I would make him some supper and later go to bed. Not long after my husband would come to bed and everything downstairs would quiet and still. The cat with three kittens would sit sleepily infront of the fire and the horse in the stable will sleep quietly.  Words: 235
