I am studing maths English lit french and chemistry. My freands are studing roughly the same things which is good then we can help each other. I am still colecitng stamps I have built quite a large colection now. I hope to be come a doctor my maths teacher is nice but I hate my Engish bloke. when I come home I sit down and read the papers and at 10.30 I go to bed after watching a lot of television. On Saturdays I study but on sundays I go out in the car which is a 1968 ford although it is 14 years old its runs quite well. some week ends I go and see my mother and father in whitstable. Then I have to get under my father's car and do the work on it. The garden is large so there is a lot of work to be done in it the grass to be cut. Sometimes I help [male name] my younger brother on his work he studies at anther univeresity. we arrange it so that we come down at the same time. [male name] has got a girl friend but have not got one yet. [female name] my elder sister has gone to Australia so when she write's she sends me stamps. When I leave university I am going to go to a school where I will be finishing of the touches before I come a fully trained Doctor.  Words: 283
