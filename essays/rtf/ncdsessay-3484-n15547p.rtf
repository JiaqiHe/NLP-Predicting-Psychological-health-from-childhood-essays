When I'm 25 well for my job I hope to be a nurse and look after sick people. Then I will have one child and just nurse in day time. And then I might retyre from nurseing and just be a house wife. When my child has grown up into a nice young lady I hope she will come and visit me and I shall bake and and make nice dinners. I shall pick a nice young man and hope he'll have a good job and bring lots of money home from his job. And while I'm still young I'll keep my home kleen and do all my spring cleaning every spring and I'll do some nice cooking.  Words: 118
