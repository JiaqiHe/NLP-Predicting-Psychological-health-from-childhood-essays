At the age of 25 I would like to be an Architect and design houses, dams, and bungurlows. I would be a bachala and my house would be a two story detached house. I wold belong to a sailing club and a tenis club. A house cleaner would come once a week and would clean most of the house at a time. Moter bikes would not be my favorate vircals nor would lorryes. In fact my car would be fitted with an anty noise exsaust so as not to make too much nouse. I might even go out of my way and design a new moter bike for difficult people. I would live in a town near [town] because my work would be in [town]. my car would be a two seater car but not a sports car.  Words: 138
