I dont know if I will have a wife or any children I properly will have started work but I do not know what I am going to be when I grow up yet. I will lean to drive a car and properly get a moter bike. I might go to a universecity to lean something I had not lernt at school like how to mend a car or a moter bike. I could learn to fly a plane or a hellecopter. I might learn to drive a raceing car and be in a race with other raceing cars. I might be interested in chemistry a become a chemist or I might be interested in electonics and become a electerson. I might become a school teacher and teach children.  Words: 129
