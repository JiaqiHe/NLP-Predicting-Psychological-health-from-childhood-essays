I am now a nurse and leading a very interesting life. I will tell you a few of the things which I do in the hospital the other day I went into the oprating theatre where a paintent was gabing her tonsils out it does not take long it is no longer than halfhour to have them out when the paitent has had them out they are took back into the ward some of the paintents are so well you could call it sort of meany some have to have injections as they are fighty. At home when I am there I try to learn about nursing I work very hard when the tests come along as I always try to pass them. And that is a few of the things of my life at 25.  Words: 136
