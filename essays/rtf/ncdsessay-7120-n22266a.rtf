When I am 25 I Want to Be Married and have three children I Would have 2 Boys and one girl I Want the Boys in school and have Someone Who could looke After the girl So that I Would Be able to go out and Work. I Would like to go to Work in a Place like Woolworths So I Would Be home by Seven 'O' Clock to See to My Children I Would give them Supper then let them Stay Down untill about Nine of school days. Than* If My hus*band Came Home about half Past Nine I Would Makk him Supper than We Could Watch TV for a Wile than go to Bed about 12 'O' Clock.
      Than if it was a nice Day on a Satuday we could go out for the Day With the Children and in the Evening I could have Some One to Watch the children While we go out By our Selves. I think I Would live near to My family So We could Visit them When We Would like to. I Would Rather living in a Small house than a Big house. Then My children Wold grow up and have a family of Their Own Then We would Just live on our own for the rest of our lifes  Words: 218
