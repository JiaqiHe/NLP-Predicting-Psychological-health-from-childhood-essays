I live on a farm in Derbyshire. It is a sheep farm and it is now the lambing season. I have so far 27 yews and 31 rams. So far I have thirteen lambs. I also have a few hens and ducks. I own 74 acres of land. My wife is called April and I have three children. Three sons and one daughter, [male name] is 17, [female name] is 21, [male name] is 3 and [male name] is 7. My wife is 26 and was an art student in London. 
We live in [location] and our farm is called [farm name]. 
I hope to go to Australia, and be the owner of a sheep farm in Western Australia. 
We have two dogs called Betsy and Rufus, Betsy has just had a bitch of four puppys. We are going to call them Jim, Betsy II, Rufis II and Millie. We have three farm helpers [male name], [male name] and [male name]. 
We have three cows to give us milk. They are called Aunt Bella, Uncle Tony and Grandpa Shamus. 
Our house is made of flint and we have dry-stone-dyke round all our fields. We have two barns, one sheering house, seven lambing pens and one hen house. We also have two Land-rovers one tractor, one jeep and three trailers. 
If we get to Western Australia I am going to call our farm the pride of Western Australia.  Words: 237
