I am now working in [city] collecting marine life for the college to study. I enjoy my work although it is very dangerous. Every day a side trawler goes out to sea and I dive down and bring up samples. The wage is twenty five pounds.
      I live in a flat not far from the pier. My proper home is in [town]. Sometimes I go diving in the lake. At my home I have a large collection of stones I have had some for fifteen years.  Words: 86
