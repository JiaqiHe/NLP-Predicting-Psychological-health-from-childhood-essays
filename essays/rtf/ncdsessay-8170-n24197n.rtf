My name is [name], I am at University and I am studying to be a pilot. It is not hard hear for most of the time we listen. We play football, tennis and other games.
      When school is over I would go home and do my homework. After I would tell my mother that I am going fling. I belong to a club wich is open every week. I take my small piper comanche (one engined aeroplane) and fly it for about fiffteen minutes and then go home.
      After about a few weeks I would get a test. If I passed I could become a pilot if I couldn't I would have to do something else. 
      They would then send me to a private school where they would teach me the instuments in a jet-engined aircraft. They then would give me another test, if I passed I would be the co-pilot of a small aeroplane, if I didn't pass I would have to take the test again.
      A few weeks or months later they might make me a pilot of a small aircraft, then of a large one.
      When I am to old to fly I would resine and become a general of the R.A.F.  Words: 206
