My name is ****, I am at the Royal Vetinary Surgeon College, learning to be a vet. I have 18 months left to finish my training. 
     When I leave. I plan to get married and have a private house with a huge garden at the back, and, if I'm lucky, a swimming pool. I am all day very busy treating sick animals. And sometimes I'm called out in the middle of the night. On Wednesday there is a meeting at the village public hall for vets, to which I attend, this meeting is to ban circuses altogether for us vets thing it is very cruel to make animals perform tricks. If a circus has dogs, when they are wagging their tails you might think they are happy. But they're only wagging their tails because they're glad to get out of their cages. 
     I have not said anything about my social life so I will do it now. 
     I have a great many friends but most of them I became friendly with at the college. At the college, we live in groups of four in a flat. Once a week we go to the main hall, where there is a film show about vets work. This is very interesting, and lasts from 7 pm till 9.30 pm. then we go back to our flats and to bed. Other nights ive may study or go out to resturants or such places. 
     When my training has ended I will earn my living of course as a vet. I should like to go abrouad for a holiday somewhere like Italy or such places. But that will depend on how much I earn and save.  Words: 284
