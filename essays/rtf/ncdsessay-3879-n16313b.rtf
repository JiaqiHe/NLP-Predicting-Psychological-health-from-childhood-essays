My work at 25 will be helping Dad on the farm and on Saturday afternoons playing criket for [cricket club] cricket team. I'd rater help with the machiney than the animals. I might somtimes go birddriving and give other farmers a bit when we arent very busy I might not marry, but if I do I am not marrying one of posh powder and perfume covered nits you see walking about. They are just plain silly I think. They look just as nice without it. If I don't stay on Dads farm I might help with the Dam they are going to build in [valley]  Words: 105
