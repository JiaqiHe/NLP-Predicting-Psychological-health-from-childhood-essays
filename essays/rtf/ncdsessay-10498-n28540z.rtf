I am now at work. I am a lady who helps children at school. I do not teach I just help. Every Saturday morning, I go ice skating with my friend [name], and her daughter [name]. I read about one book in about two weeks. I like writing poems, sometimes they are funny, sometimes they are sad. I like most of the children at school. Sometimes I take one class of the infants for P.E. When I get home from school I do a flower arrangement. When I go to book up for my holidays I sometimes go abroad. Last year I went to Spain, this year I am going to France. It is costing about 200 pounds. My husband and my two children [name] and [name].
