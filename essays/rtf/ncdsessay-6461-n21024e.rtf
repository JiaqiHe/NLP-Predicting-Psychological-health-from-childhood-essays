I work in a hairdress's I have worked here for nearly a year and I am one of the youngest. After a year or more I wanted to become a teacher. I am working the hair-dress's for a part time job. At last my answer came, that I could go to college to study Maths and English. I stayed here for four years till my chance came. I was asked to help out at a primary school. I was going to teach first class * my first day I got to know the children. Most evenings I stayed and made objects for the class to try. I got on very well with this class my time soon went and it was time to back to college but I was asked to stay on all the time because they didn't have many staf I was told that I had to take top class and I found that quite different. After a w*ll I got to know what they had done with * other teacher and what they hadn't. I took the class on many trips. At the end of the year my class left and I had to start all over again. But with this class I found my time after school hadn't been waisted this class took more intrest in maths. I went on teaching till I was forty and my time as a teacher hadn't been waisted I had tought many different thing to the class I had tought I use to go back a few time to help out like I did when I first started teaching.
