I am an M.p. I was elected an M.p. when I was twenty-four. I have two children Gregory and Jennifer and was married at the age of twenty. Parliment doesn't sit as much as it used to do and so I have time to do other things. My family and I go on a holiday about once a year and if time we sometimes to do other things. My family and I go on a holiday about once year and If time we sometimes go twice. Our favourite holiday place is Gibralter and we go at best once a year. My husband is a salesman and is at the age 27. We have go a detached house in **** and we have been living there two years. My favourite hobby is collecting shells and making things such as ashtrays with them. Another of my favourite hobbies breaking egg-shells into small pieces and making pictures with them. I also like housekeeping. Even though we have a housekeeper I sometimes do the housework instead or look after Gregory* and Jennifer when I nothing to do. My husband and I have a car each as we need them. Every sunday we go to the childrens grandparents house for tea. My favourite day in parliment is Budget Day which is sometimesboring but nearly always interesting. The first meeting I had with the Prime-Minister was on January 18th 1968. A month later I had my first meeting with Her Majesty The Queen at a dinner she was holding. At some time as a met the Prime-Minister.  Words: 261
