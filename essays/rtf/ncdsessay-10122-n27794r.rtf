I am twenty five years old my home is in New York. I move here when I was eighteen.
      My job is very interesting, because my manager sends me around New York interviewing famous artists, trapeze I mean. Last week I saw the most unusual act done by a lady, [name] jumped fifteen feet through the air turning a double somersalt half way. When she had finished the act which consisted of hanging from her ankles and spinning round and round which was was very brave of her, she came and talked to me. She said that she had started acrobatics when she was eight and a half. 
      I am interested on ballet and swiming. Last year I won a gold medal for swiming. I had to swim half a mile and dive in off the top diving board in pyjamas and als swim two widths under water. I am not very good at ballet. but I have passed a few graded exams. 
      I am married to a twenty seven year old American. We have girl twins who are three and a eighteen month son. The lady next door looks after our children from ten am to four pm. Our house is a six roomed bungalow
      I am expecting a big contract to tell me that I can go to America to interveiw more famouse people. It will be a big step up in life so good luck to me.  Words: 242
