When I am 25 years old I would like to go to new market to be a jokey I have always liked watching racing on a Saturday afternoon or watching the grand Nationl that is a very old subject and not forgeting the darby s every year they have a Natinol and a darby. Sometimes I go to hadock Park and Chester racecoarse It is only seven and six to go on to the stands at the racecorse or on the steakes, me and my dad went to haydock park he asked me to pick a hoarse so I did and won thirty six shillings and I got a 10 shilling note for winning the bet. If I don't go to a place were I could talke to a person about the job and he might be alble to help me with my progress at school when I was there.  Words: 150
