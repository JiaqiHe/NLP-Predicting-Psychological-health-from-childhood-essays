"I'm working at a factory, Just out side of the town. It is quite a good job I have got to see that the proudiution is going all right. The factory is a toy one we are making dolls. One day my boss tolled me that some of the dolls had been stolen. And then there were more stolen so he told me to find out who was steling them. Thay night I stayed up to see who was stelling them.
It was about mid-night when the light was put on, then two men came in and creped about while this was going on I hid behind a big box. Slowly the men opened the door where the dolls are cept. when they were in, and rushing about I locked them in. Then I went home. In the morning I told the boss about last night. When i took him down to the room were the two men where and opend the door know body was there but the window was open.
""They must have got out the window."" I said.
""Yes, they weill not come back to night so you can go home.""
But that night they came back. 
""They came back last night so you will have to **** on gard tonight.""
That nigh they came back not to tack some dolls but to thump me, it was a tellbil fight. I kocked one out and the other kocked me out. So in the morning I was found unkonses on the ground. I picked two more men to help me, and that night we could them."  Words: 263
