My age is 25 I am a professional footballer I am enjoying the footballing life and when the season is in full go I have a weekly check up. My other intrests are a day out fishing golf and swimming. When I have a rest I ussually go to a near by field where I play and teach eager youngster who also want a football career I have one son who is two and he likes football. My home is in [city] it has four bedrooms, a garage, a bathroom, a living room, dinning room and kitchen it cost xxxx18,000. and a acre of land. When I retire from football I am going into a factory where I hope I will be manager and earning more money than I would playing football.
      My life is quite good but I sometimes look on the dark side of things. I like being a do it your self man, like building a extension for the house and things like that as well as being a handy man I like gardening, looking after the lawn (Of Course it has a miniture foot ball pitch marked on it) and I mostly like roses and tree ones.
