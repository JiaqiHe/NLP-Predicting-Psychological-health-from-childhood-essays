I'm in college and I'm hoping to be a surgeon. I have just finished my two years in hospital as a Doctor after this I hope to go to the Edinburgh Unicresity for sugeons or the London University for Surgeons. At home with my parents in the holidays I get new clothes to take back with me. in the summer I'm on holiday's most of the time and when I come back I get packed and go off to school again. In my liesare time I swot up getting ready for any unexpected revision exams now and again I like going for a swim and watching the television  Words: 108
