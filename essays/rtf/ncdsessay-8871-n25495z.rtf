I Shall like to be a hairdresser and I would like to have a family after I am married. I would have a very new house which has Just been built, and I would have a big kitchen and a very big Living-room, and a nice bedroom and decorated in pink paint and a nice light Green wallpaper. I would not have one servant in the house, I would do all the work myself. My work would be a shop in the town and it would be called [hairdressers]. I would be the cheif person of the shop and my husband would be the manerger. If I had a girl I would like her to be a pop singer or a hairdresser which she would take after me.  Words: 128
