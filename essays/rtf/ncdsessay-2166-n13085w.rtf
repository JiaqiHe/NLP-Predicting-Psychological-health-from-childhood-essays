I work in a bank in the high street and I injoy it very much. At home I do all the cooking that is done. I also do all the house-work. I am interested in looking after children. I do this as a sparetime job. I do it at the childrens home. The live I lead I think is very interesting it is also very pleasant. The best is taking the children to the park. I have two of my own. I take them all over the place as I thing we had good child hood so why should they not have the same sort as us. I can always find some thing to do in the home. My children are very helpful by going to the shop when I ask them to.  Words: 133
