The year is 1983 I am a painter and I get paid well. I have just finished my apprentaship. I make tables for packets of tea and tins of fruit. My interests are fishing and swimming. I go fishing quite often by the river [river]. And swim at the [location] Bridge. I still live with my Mother and Father and give them some of the money I earn at work. My sister would be seventeen and left school and also got a job. My life is quite compacted with my work but I still have time to go out with freinds. I try not to spend to much money if I have to so that I have enough when I have a house my own to pay the rated electricity bills and gas and to by a car.  Words: 138
