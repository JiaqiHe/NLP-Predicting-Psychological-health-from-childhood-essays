I like to play tennis, but I work in a hair drsser's shop, in my spare time I write poetry. I would go to Astraia. I would like to get maried and have Children, when I have children I would leeve the hair dresser's shop. I will have a car I would visit my perent's every day, I will take great care of my children when my children get yp to the age of Sixtine I wold probley get a Job. I would like very much to wrte a book of poetry as I am very interested in it. I would not get maried tiol I was twentyfour. I would make my home very respectable and take great care of it. I would work hard for to keed my house respetable I would like my hu*pand to be well mannerd. I hope my husband has a good Job like a ship biulder. I woud like a little cottage in the country a that is were I would get my poetry from.  Words: 171
