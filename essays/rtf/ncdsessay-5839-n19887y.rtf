On my 25 birthday, I was giving some money and I have saving some money up from my birthdays ago. I would go on a tour round the world, for three months. Then came home and get a job on a plane. from some money I would buy a small car and the money left over I would get a flat for myself.
      On the tour I would go to the cold places and hot places in the world. My job would like to be a driver in a plane to Spain, or anywhere. The car I would like to ride in, is called a mini it is a small car. 
My flat would have one bedrooms one kichen. A small room with T.V. and some chair. Went I am home I go up to Scotland or round [city] to see a football match or go to see friends.  Words: 149
