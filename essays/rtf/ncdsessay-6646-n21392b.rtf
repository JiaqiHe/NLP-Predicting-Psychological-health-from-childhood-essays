If I was 25 years old I would buy a car, and I would like to be a driver, One that goes aroud and give's people things. I would like to go out birdwathing ever Saturday morning I would get maired and buy a house. I would go to the seaside ever year, I would stay for a fortnight and then go back home, i would like to build my house in the country. I would buy a Dog and I would it pip, And then I would make a family. Sometimes I may go to play golf. I would buy some furnichue. I would learn my children to swim. I would buy them toy's.
