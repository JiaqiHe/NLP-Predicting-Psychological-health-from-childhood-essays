I live in [road] with my wife and baby boy. I work as an assistant in [company] on the corner of [road]. I go to church whenever I can and after church on Sunday I go to the park and play football with some friends. My wife and myself are hoping to get a house of our own as we are still living with my family. The hours of my work are from 9 a.m to 5 p.m. I also play darts at the club every Saturday and I still have a large collection of stamps and I am still collecting them. When [name], our baby, is five he will be taken to a Primary School and we hope that he will settle down.  Words: 124
