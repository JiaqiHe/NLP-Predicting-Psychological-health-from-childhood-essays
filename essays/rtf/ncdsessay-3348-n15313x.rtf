I do oil paintings often in my spare time and work in some kind of shop. Probably I would still be with my perents by then I might be an aunt or even a mother. I think if every I got sacked or had to leave my job I would take up painting. I think I would have to work within the hours of eight a.m. to eight p.m. I think I would like it very much. I would ride a very lot and spend hours in the country painting and stecking. I would swim a lot at the local swimming pool and often make trips in my holidays to the sea. If we had a war I would like to be in a radar, on if they had them then a lady in the R.A.F. I hope there will be no very tall building with about fifty floors I would not mind living in a three floor flat or even and five but any higher and I would feel caged in. I think shall live a simple life and I am sure bread will cost more that 1s 6d. I think I will stay in the Roman Cathlic fath but by then it my all be comunisam. I would like to join a club of some sort and would enjoy going in for Gymghanas and swimming races although my stroke now is not good.  Words: 235
