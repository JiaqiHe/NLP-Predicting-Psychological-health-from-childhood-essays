I play for a football club and I enjoy it very much. Out of my work I own a sports shop in London. On Saturday I play for my football clup. The mach starts at 3 p.m. till 5.30 p.m. My shop is not very big But I get a lot of custermers. Most of my custermers are from schools and sport clubs. I am a bachlor and my mum and dad both live with me over my shop I hope to by myself a new house out of the town. At night time I sometime's go out with my girl freid to a night club on I sometime's stay a home and wacth T.V. I have a Blue sports car with a whit converteball roof. In week days when I an not at my sports shop I either go to other sport shops to find what they sell, or I go around other football club's to see them train. In the  holadays I drive a taxi cab around London.  Words: 170
