I am a nurse I work in [xxxxxxx] hospital. On Wedensday I have the afternoon off, I usually just sit around and rest at home or read. I don't live at the hospital. the pay is quite good although I don't really care about the pay as long as I'm a nurse. I've wanted to be a nurse since I was 10 years old. I used to buy some books called the sue barton books she was a nurse. I enjoy my life as a nurse, up in the morning at half past seven into my uniform get washed and off into my ward, ward 3. Carrying trays back and forth, giving medicine to patients, taking temperatures giving bed baths to people and now and again into the operating theatre but as I'v said before, I enjoy it. I have grown to like the hospital smells. The hospital has an atmosphere and I hate being away from it.  Words: 158
