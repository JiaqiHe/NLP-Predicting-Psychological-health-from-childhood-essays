I would like to be a short-hand typset or be a teacher. Make books, or be a nurse. I would not like to get married. I am twenty five and I am a short-hand typset and I work in an office. And there are nice People there. I met and every day I met new people. I am living with my mother and I go to clubs and a cinemas with my friends at work But sometimes I just sit at work and read books or watch television. But sometimes I go out for walks if there is nothing to do at home.  Words: 103
