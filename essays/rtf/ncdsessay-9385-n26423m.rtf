If I manage to get A and O levels at Collage I should want to work as an electronic engineer. I'm not to sure about getting married and would probably be a bathalor for quite some considrable amount of time. I'd buy a small flat somwhere in London and run a small two seater sports car. I would come home from work at 6 pm and rexlax either wathing the television or reading magazines and books, Sometimes I would go out in the evening to the cinama, or to a party or concert. On Saturdays I would play some sort of sport (cricket, football, Tennis or Golf.). On Sunday I would go out for a drive or strole to some place interesting. Sometimes I would go into London to do a spot of shopping. I would visit my Mother Father and Brother as often as I could. I would buy a five speed racing bike and do a lot of long cycle races. I like fast moving things and would go prety fast in my car. (thats why I'd buy a sports). Even though I don't want to get married Id still go out with a lot of girls.  Words: 199
