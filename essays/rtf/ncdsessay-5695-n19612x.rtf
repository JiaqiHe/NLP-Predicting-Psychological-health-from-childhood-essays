If I were 25 I would have a job as a short-hand-tipist and in my spear time I would look after children in the nights or baby sit and I would go to Bingo and I would go to danceing club and I would paint picters sometimes to in my spear time and I would live with my mother and have a room to myself with all paints in it and hang all the paintings up on the wall.
