I am now twenty five and at the moment I am leading a happy life. I am married and have a child. Her name is [name]. She is only one year old but is very clever at talking but I am a fraid she cannot walk. But she does get around she crawls on her knees. The house work isn't easy but I manage to get it finished by the end of the evening. By that time I am blown out. Then I have to make my husband his tea and by that time [name] is in bed My husband comes in at six thirty. He usually has sandwiches. He comes in sits down and watches the television. He watches the television until about nine oclock and then we both read. We go to bed about half past eleven and we both have to get up at seven oclock. I dont usually get dressed but just slip on my dressing gown. I go down into the kitchen and make him some breakfast. I often make him some bacon and two eggs occaisionally some slices of bread and butter. He leaves at seven thirty. He works as an engineer and his wages are fifteen pounds a week. He sometimes brings me something little home and maybe a doll or some sort of toy for [name]. I bought a push chair for [name] with the money that my husband brings home. I have a big pram but it isn't any good because the wheel is bent. But it is still in the loft but we keep it in case we want another baby.  Words: 271
