At the age of twenty five I hope I cane work at the law hospital. I like to do this job because my father is the gatekeeper there If I can not do this I will perhaps join the army because of the chance to see the world and other thing I also like this because of the modern weapons they will have then. I hope to be a army engineer to fire tanks and other things. If I do not like it I will be a salier also because of the chance to see the world and to do some deep sea diving and aquanots stuff When I am 50 years old if I live to be that I will just be a watchman, or gateman at a hospital or somthing. In my early years I would like to sea France, Spain, Switzerland and Italy Malta Gibralter and finally egypt  Words: 151
