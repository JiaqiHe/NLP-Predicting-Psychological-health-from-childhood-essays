When I am 25 I will want to serve on H.M.S. Ark Royal as a Pilot my interests would be stamps swimming ag geography. I would sail around the world and fly. If I could in my off duty time I would like to help in the gallery or go to the gymnasyem, I would have a gold watch a signate ring a radio and a pack of cards as part of my treasure. I would take R.N. history lessons for a pleasure when I came to England I would visit my parents and enjoy the countryside by riding horses camping and other outdoor activities I would have a dog called Smudge prefrably a collie, I shall be clean shaven I won't smoke when I go to the gym I would box train for athletics and play rugby and football. I wiil eat lots of fruit drink lots of milk and eat things that are good for you, I would write home to my mum and dad once a week and visit a doctor once a month.
