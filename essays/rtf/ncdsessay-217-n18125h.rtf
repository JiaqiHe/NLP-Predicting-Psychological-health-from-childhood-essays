I have the job of a Mechanical Engineer, earning about £30 a week. The job of a Mechanical Engineer is designing and controling the job of making bridges and other Mechanical things. My main interest are of aviation and I often go gliding in the holidays. I are now working on the project of making an automatic swing bridge 2 miles long. I live in a bungalow with Electric Central Heating. I set out for work at 8. O clock a.m. and arrive at about 8.30.a.m. from then till 6.o clock.p.m. I take command of the bridge-making. I am back home by about 6. 30.p.m. at which time I have my tea, at about seven O clock I watch television until 10. o clock at which time I go to bed. I work 5 days aweek unless they is a rush job then I work 7 days a week. I own a motor speed boat and a glider and at the week-ends I often go gliding or out in my speed-boat. I sometimes go fresh water fishing I have a 12ft fibre glass rod with a spin reel I have a series of splitshot and hooks. I usually use maggots for bait. I usually have a real big struggle trying to get a pibe on shore especially a big one which often break the line. Then after the week-end back to work.  Words: 232
