I have been married for four years and I have a very happy life. I love to cook and I make lots of lovely things. I have 4 children all under the age of 4. I live in a lovely bungalow and I go out everyday to work. I am a short hand typist (secretary). In my spare time I like to go gardening or dancing.  Words: 66
