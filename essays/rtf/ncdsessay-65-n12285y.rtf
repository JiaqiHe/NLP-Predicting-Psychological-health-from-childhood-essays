If I was 25 I would start studying to be a Wren. When I had studied for as long as I should, I would start as a secretary and perhaps the captain of a ship would invite me onto his ship to go for a voyage to another country or a small island. I would learn a few languages perhaps and make friends with people from other countries. During the holidays I would go and visit my family. Perhaps meat a jolly sailor and have a family of my own.
