When i am 25 my interest is to be a typist in my office. I am very interesting in it I do not know why. I just like it. I shall live with my mother if she doe'*nt die and look after her and then I shall sometimes have a walk the next mor*ning when I go into work I won't dis obey the maneger and will not be cheeky because it is not brawns get you into a job it is manners and another thing if you consantrate on what you are doing you will find out it is good. For example if you wanted to be a nurse and a typist you should decide your mind what you want to be because you may be typing and you get off by thinking about a nurse. So as I say when I am 25 I should like to be a first class typist I am now at training at a school in (town) every alternative Wednesday and you get home work there. Too I am very happy there.
