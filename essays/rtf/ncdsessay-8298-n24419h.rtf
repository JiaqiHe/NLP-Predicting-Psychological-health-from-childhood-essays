I am now twenty five years old and I have just left unnerversity. The first thing I had to do was to get a flat or a house. I soon got a flat in London, and the rent was five pounds, and I had to get a job but I coulden't find one anywere, so I decided upon joining the air force as a pilot. So I went back to my flat to pack all my things. Thanks to my degree I got at unnerversityI was quickly acsepted for flying training. While I was training I made friends with a Micheal Stuart. When we both got our pilots wings we were stationed at Linconshire. At Linconshire, I was promoted to flight luitenant and I let three aircraft on morning patrols. My friend and myself stayed i nthe airforce for three years, and then we went back to civillian life. We lived together in a house outside London and I worked as an office clerk in an office near London.  Words: 169
