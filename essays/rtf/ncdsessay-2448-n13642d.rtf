I am now 25 and I am still unmaried. I am in my second year in the Royal College of Music. My main ambition is to teach part time and also to become a member of an orchestra. As a child a played the guitar and I am quite good at it now but I am trying to learn the violin. Music is not my only interest in life for I enjoy art as well. Often in my spare time I paint pictures and make models. I like making pots and pieces of sculpture and sometimes I get my room into a terrible mess as I chip away at a piece of marble. When I finish my five years of studying I hope to get married and have children. It would be lovely to have a happy home and family. If my ambition as a musician fails I shall teach juniors and study maths. Still I am not doing to badly in college now and am over the first hurdle but I have a long way to go. At the moment I am waiting for the results of an exam in music and if I pass it I will be half way there. I fail I shall be quite content to settle down and look after my family.  Words: 218
