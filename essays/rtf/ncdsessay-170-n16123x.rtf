I am married with a son. I'm leading a happy life, with a new modd Sunbeam Rapier. I'm a very keen bird-watcher and a keeper of finches. My son is only two years old. My job is a footballer and a part-time lawyer. At home I spend a lot of time with my kids. At work I'm in an office or on a football pitch. Two hours a day sometimes more I'm training. At home on days [illegible] I play with my son at football. I also go bird watching with some friends. On Saturday afternoon I'm playing football and sometimes on Wednesday I'm doing the same. I still like playing table tennis at a club. When my family wente on a holiday in Marsailles I did a lot of spear-fishing and skin-diving. On most nights of our holiday we got a baby-sitter and my wife and I went to the cinema or dances. back home pre-season training, the dreg of football.  Words: 162
