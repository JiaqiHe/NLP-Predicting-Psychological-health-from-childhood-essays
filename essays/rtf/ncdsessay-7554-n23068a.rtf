I will get an house somewhere in the country. just a little one like a cottage. I hope to be near shops. So I can just get something when I want it. But I wouldnt want it to be a lonely place. Somewhere where other people lived. I am going to be a gardener. I will make a garden outside. I will probably work in a green house sometimes in a park. It is hot in a green house but you get used to it. I like flowers a specialy crocuses. They are only little flowers. I hope to get two or three pound at first. But I will do peoples gardens for them and they might give me a pound or something. At first you have to do horrible things like weed or make tea you have to do that in most jobs. Like painting or egeniring.  Words: 148
