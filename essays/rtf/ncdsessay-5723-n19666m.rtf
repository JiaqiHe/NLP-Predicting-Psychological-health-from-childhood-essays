I'm now a footballer, and the life I'm leading is hard-doings in a way. Because of the injuries you get by playing football. The life at home is difficult because of the money, and the clothing. And my interests are to learn more about football, and about a part time jon. for when the football season has finished My main interests are to collect more money for my home and things like that My job as a football* can easly be stopped by injures which would be difficult again because of the sortage of money and working. If I did have another job I would be happy with an easy job like working in a garage as part time. Or painting people or scenery. One thing I will not do is smoke, like my mother. If I lived in a Germany I would be a football but if I can't play football I would be a shop keeper, or a car seller, or even a carpenter like my Uncel is was in Germany.  Words: 173
