I own a farm. but it is not an ordinary farm, it is a pet farm and I have many animals. If someone's pet has got hurt or burned I can help it. For I am a vet and many people come to me. At home we are very happy with dogs, cats, rabbits, baby lambs, chicks and ducklings and goats running around everywhere. My husband is a vet as well and every weekend we go to the village to buy food for us and the animals. I go on my horse and my husband goes by the van. My sister often visits us with her pet dog and cat. I exercise the dogs by going for a 2 mile run every morning and eavning. Near our farm is a wood and many squirells and Deer come and visit us in the morning and I can't resit giving them some thing to eat. About four miles away Farmer [name] who is our nearest neibour often brings us some of his vegetables and fruit as a presant when one of his cows or sheep get ill and we can cure it.
The farm is in the country and it is very peaceful in the day. In the night you can hear an owl or two and sometines in the old hay barn you can hear a barn-owl and see some bats. We love it in our farm and we wouldent swop the farm for a million pounds nor the animals for I love animals and birds very much. To much even to sell all of them.  Words: 264
