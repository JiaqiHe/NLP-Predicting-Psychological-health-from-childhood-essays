As I am 25 years old I am still living with my parents in our bungulow on the edge of [xxxxxxx] which has now developed into a large shopping centre. The best sport I like is sailing which I do on Friday nights after I come home from work and Saturday afternoon. On Sundays I go with my parents down to watch the cricket match on the playing fields which have contracted a lot since I was a boy. As I walk down there I have to watch out for small boys which are on bicycles which have a little [illegible fiche - engine] under the saddle. Every year we go on holiday to the [xxxxxxx] which are getting more and more crowded every year. Some years we go to Holland and hire a sailing boat to sail in parts of the hook of Holland. this year I am saving up to go on a holiday to Perth in Australia.  Words: 160
