I am now 25 years old and I have a job which I like. In my time off I do my favorite hobbies which are reading, and writeing to my freinds. 
When I go back to work I am realy glad because I see all my freinds again and we work together. I have two weeks holiday and in my holiday go to places which my freinds tell me about. The life I am having is a nice quite life and I like it **y much. I like going to see slows and I have to go and I have to go and see how one of my freinds is in hospital. I like going shopping and getting new clothes I like to do swimming and they are some of my hobbies. I go to see freinds that worked were I work and they still have a good jobs, One of them owns a horse called silver, the horse is a stallain and he is a very fine horse. I like to go riding on saturdays. Then I go back to work and see my other freinds.  Words: 187
