I have a good life and I am not married. I have been working as an electronic engeneer. My pay is good and I am living in a skyscraper. I still go to matches and watch television. Evrey Saturday I go out with a friend him and his wife. We usualy come back at half past twelve at night. When I have any spare time I work in my fathers shop. When he is of his work on either, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday I usualy take his place. I do this because, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday is my day of and this is my part time job. If my father is not of however I work in his shop as a painter. I have one hobby however and that is roller skating at the Palle.  Words: 135
