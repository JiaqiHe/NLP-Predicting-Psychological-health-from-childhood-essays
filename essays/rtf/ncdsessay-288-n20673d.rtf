I start my work at nine o clock in the morning and I get the number four to the hospital where I work. At half past nine I start working in ward 10 the childrens ward. I sometimes have to wash the children who can not get up from their beds, then sometimes I read the smaller children a story. At a quarter to twelve I help to get the childrens dinner ready then I go home and have my own dinner. When I have finished my dinner I then go and wash the dishes. I then have to tidy the living room and make the beds.
