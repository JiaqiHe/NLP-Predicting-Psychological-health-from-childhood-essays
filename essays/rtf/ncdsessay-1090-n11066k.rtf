----------------------
My home is quite large, and situated at a corner. I am a Primary Teacher at a school near my home. There are 36 children in my class, most of them girls. There are 23 girls, and 13 boys. The class is Primary 3. I give them painting roughly 1 time each week. Every second week on a Friday I give them a test.
When I get home each day, I sometimes have some jotters to mark. It usually takes about an hour. I finish about 5 o'clock, I start to make the tea then, or maybe go down to the shops for some food for the house.
I like to have some neighbours in to coffee in the holidays. They ask me to their houses too. At night time, about 7.30. om, I sometimes go for a walk. I watch the television, while I brush my cat at night sometimes. I go to Tennis every Saturday morning. I get of school every Friday afternoon, and I go to the Swimming Baths. I practise different strokes, and diving of the Diving Board. I sometimes go to the Cinema, if there is something good on.
I like to think up things to do at school for the childre. We do things like making cardboard billages, and the children bring old cardboard boxes. I show the children on the blackboard how to make the houses etc.  Words: 231
