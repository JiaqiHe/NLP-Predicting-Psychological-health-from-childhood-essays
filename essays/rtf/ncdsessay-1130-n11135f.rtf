I am twenty five years old and happily married. I have two children. I get a baby sitter every Saturday night so that my husband and I can have a night out together. My husband works as a painter and brings twenty eight pound in a week so I have no need to work at all. But when the two childen go to school I think that I will start working part time, just to keep my mind ocupied. The house which we are living in doesn't take much cleaning because it is a brand new house. Every day my mother comes for her dinner as she works near to where we live The two children like her very much because everyday she gives them some money for some sweets. I have told her not to because she spoils them. Our house is very convinient for shops. There is an arcade just outside of our house. I like to read very much. Mostly love story books. There is a public library just down the road from our house. The two childen are both girls. The oldest is four and will soon be starting school, and the youngest is one and a half. I am up a seven o'clock every morning with the youngest. On a morning she cries that much that some one has to go and see to her, and that person is usually me. I am very happy in the life I am leading now and I wouldn't want to change it for the world.  Words: 257
