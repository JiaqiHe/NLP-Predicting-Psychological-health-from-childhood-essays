"I joined the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders when I was seventeen, since then I have risen to the rank of Pipe Major. I enjoy my life amongh the high, wild hills and Mountains of Northern Scotland very much. My interests vary, to say the least, for I love pipe music and cleaning the drones. Yet I have a rather unorthodox love of firearms and field guns.
My home life is very calm indeed, and I am very happy. Though I very seldom see my family I am very contented with my life and would not exchange my position for all the diamonds in Kimberley.
My life with The Regiment is very interesting and sometimes dangerous. Some rather interesting moments for me were when I led my regiment to the sound of the pipes playing ""Jonnie Cope aer ye awakin Yet."" up a steep incline into the enemy trenches. Another interesting moment was when ""Mad [male name],"" (Leftenant Colnel [male name] [surname] DFC. DSO and two bars) and I drove a jeep armed with two Browning .303 machine guns into an enemy fort in Aden.
Well as you may see from ""above"" I lead a jolly exciting life."  Words: 194
