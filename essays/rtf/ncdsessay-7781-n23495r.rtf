I am 25 years old and I work as a coalman, every-day I go to work and I load my lorry with coal and away I go. Along the lanes I go delivering coal and knocking doors, rushing here and there. When I get home I have a nice bath.
I then watch the television for quite a time and then I go to bed. Day after day I go and do the same every morning.
Saturday nights I am very tired and I go to bed after my bath. My intrest are watching football and woodwork. Sundays I don't go to work and I do some woodwork in the shed. I sometimes make teapot stands and a pipe rack* for my pipes.
I sometimes go out for a ride with my wife and children to a beach. On the way back we may go and see my mother who lives near the beach. 
Sometimes I often feel board doing my job - so I often get a helper. I usally finish my job about 5 o-clock  Words: 174
