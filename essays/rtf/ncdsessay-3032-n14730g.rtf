At twenty-five I am a private typist and secratary. I am engaged to be married. I live in a flat with a friend. Its great to have a night doing ballroom dancing, watching a ballet or a play. I have a nice time hairdressing. Trying to invent new styles. For a holiday I usualy swim in the sea in different countries or join a pony trek. I like buying new clothes and I am a bit extravagent. I also like cooking, making all kinds of egsotic dishes. I work everday of the week exept Sundays. I have quite a lot of paid holidays to enjoy myself If I can afford it.  Words: 111
