I would like to be a teacher when I grow up. I would like to teach infants. I have doubts whether I shall pas* for a teacher. If not I shall be a secotary. I shall get married if I can, and have a bout three to children. When the children are older I shall go back to teaching. I now am 25. I have left teaching for a while as I have two children and the third one is arriving on the fith of June. I hope it will be a girl as I have two boys already. Last week my friend came and baby sit and* while my husband took me out to the cinama. We saw the sound of music, then we went to a re***ant we had roast beef. First we had oxtail soup, then roast beef, peas, roast patatoes, cabbage, carrots, and cauliflower. It was all very tasty. For a sweat we had fruit and ice cream. Aft* ten o'clock we went home. It is June 5th it* is a little girl, her name is sarah ken is very pleased and so am * Sarah has now learnt to crawl. She is very cheeky. The other day went set of on a picnic. We have a mini. We were half way to London when the car broke down. We phoned up the AA. They came and towed us to a garage. When we got there we told the garage men that we were going on a picnic. They were very kind, they gave as a car to lend we went on our way to london we had a very nice time. Half way back we stopped at the garage they had mended our car.  Words: 289
