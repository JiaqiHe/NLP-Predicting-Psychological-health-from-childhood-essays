When I started work I became a motor mechanic in a bus depot mending buses that have broken down and sometimes going out to mend a bus outside and driving it back to make a thourour check before it goes out again. In my spair time I would build a garage so I could mend things like cars and motor bikes. I wold by a motor bike and if it ever broke down I would mend it by myself. At home I would have a pigion cree with lots of racing pigions and some [illegible] as well. I would take them away and let them fly back to the pigion cree when I would give them their food and their water. After that I would go for a ride on my motor bike and meet my freinds and go to all places we could go to like the ice rink, the boaling alleys and the dancing rink. On my days of I would go camping. I would take a tent, stove, dixies, pans, knife, fork and spoon sleeping bag etc. I would go to places like [illegible] [xxxxxxx] and [xxxxxxx]. I would stay for as long as I would and then I would pack up and go back home. On other days of I would go to the beach and have a game of football [illegible] with my freinds. I would try to get on the local football team.  Words: 239
