I play football for a first division club my postition is centre forward. I score quite alot of goals so I get quite a lot of money, ruffly about eighty to a hundred pounds a week. Apart from football I like listening to pop records and playing with my you children. I have a girl of fifteen a boy of five and another little boy of two. I live in a little place in [county] called [district] and I live in an Estate house. It has four bedrooms a living room a dining room and kitchen. I have quite a large garden where i teach my yonger children how to play football. [name] who is five has got quite a hard kick behind him and I think he will be a very good player. [name] who is two well he just runs around dribbiling the ball. My wife has a hard job washing my football kit but Daz seems to get rid of the mud. I have-n't had a broken leg yet but I think I will soon.  Words: 178
