I Live in a nicely furneshed bunglow and have two babys mye job is a part time nurse. House work is very nice sometimes But when it comes to* spring clening it is rather horrible. When it comes to the night sometimes I would like to sit at home and rest with my husband or go to the town to dances or to restarants. At holiday time I would prefer if we go on holiday in England with the children little but as the grow older we may have some holiday abroad. The sort of frends I like would be cheerful and happy I would also like an older person to help me if I have eney proplamens thats if she will help*. As far as pets ar consend I'd have a buityful shagy colliar this dog would be aboy because I don't want puppys running aboate under my feet. Now back to my children I would have a girl first then a boy the girls name would be [female name] and the boys name* would be [male name]. We'd live near the park so the children could run about and play and with the hosptale gust around the corner it is quite convinent lieing were we are, isant it.  Words: 210
