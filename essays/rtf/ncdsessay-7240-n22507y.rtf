I am a teacher and I have thirty four children in my class. They are in the thired year and some of them are cheaky. They start their lessons and after a while they are quite. 
      I live in [area] in [House]. I have one sister and two brothers. I some times go out with my sister to see one of my aunts or to visit her friends. I sometimes go out with my boyfriend and we go out for days. When we have the holidays in school I sometimes go to France and bring back posters and different things for my class to work on. Then at quarter past four they go home and after I go out.  Words: 120
