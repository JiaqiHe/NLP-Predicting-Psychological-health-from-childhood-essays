----------------------
I was married last year. I work as a district nurse. I spend most evenings at home with my husband reading, talking, baking, or playing the piano. We also have a radio and a television. We often spend our summer weekends gardening or visiting relations and going to watch shows. We are both fond of animals and have a beagle and two guinea-pigs.
I have four* patients that I go to daily. There is an old woman who has recently had a heart attack, a young girl who has bronchitis, another girl who has had a dog bite, from a dog with rabies, and has to have daily injections and a boy with a septic thumb.
We have very pleasant neighbours and our closest friend is the vet who lives next-door to us. Altogether my husband and I leave a very happy life.  Words: 141
