I am working as a secertary. in an office. I work for four days a week, and I like my work. Every Saturday I go to different places like [location] and interesting places. I have a dog and two canary's. I like reading, going ice scating, the books I read are like Netta Muskett, ' and thriller's. When I am not at work, but have some time until, I have something else to do, I may do some work in the house, and do some dusting or something. I don't yet know weather I will get married, but I just might do. I have a boyfriend and we go to places together, and we enjoy ourselves, well I do anyway. I do not live with my mum, but I live, in a cottage on my own, in [county]. I do not much like the town but I do not really like the country. I would like to live in Spain where the weather is always warm, and the place is nice. My home life is doing the housework, and if I have any time that is when I read. When I go to work I do not come home lunchtimes, but I have sandwiches. I might move out of the cottage, and move into the town instead of the country, because in the country it is a bit quiet and there is not much to do when it is raining, but when there is nice weather there are plenty of things to do. And if I do get married (which I expect I will get married) I would like to be married in a church.  Words: 275
