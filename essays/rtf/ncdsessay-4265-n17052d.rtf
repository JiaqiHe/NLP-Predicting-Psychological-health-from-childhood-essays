Monday back to work. I am a Nurse. When I get to work from the nurse hostel the first thing to do is to wake the Patisiants up and to help the get them washed. While the paisents are getting washed the staff nurse and I make the beds. There is a little boy called [name] who away wants nurses to play with him Later on after breakfast I have to get the boys ready for all kinds of operations manly for the tonsils out. [name] is having his tonsils out but does not want to go into the operating theature alone so I go with him. At night I get my suit-cases packed for a holiday in Malta with my boyfriend [name] aged 26. I still study biolagay and Histry and sometimes dig out my Geography Book. It is a wonderful Job I am still intrested in animals and I would have been a vet if not a nurse.  Words: 160
