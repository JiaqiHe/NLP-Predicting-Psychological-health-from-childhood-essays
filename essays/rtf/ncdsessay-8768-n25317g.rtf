My Life is ver* interesting to me, I am married with no children. I study part time at college* with a friend in the morning. I work as a secretary* and I go to night school once a week as well. Next year I will have finished college and will be working as a full time secretary.
My hobbie is sewing and I make nearly all my own dresses. I also like reading and flower arranging*, my favorite author is Shakespear. Poetry I like also.
Mrs [surname] and myself run a youth club together for the village youths, it is very large considering that it is only a village that we live in.
I live in a large house which has four bedrooms, a large kitchen, a living room, a dinning room, and bathroom.
In two years time I hope to emigrate to Australia with my husband and mother-in-law who lives with us, we will stay in Australia for five years. here my family are living. My husband is a doctor and he will aply for a job with the flying doctors.
