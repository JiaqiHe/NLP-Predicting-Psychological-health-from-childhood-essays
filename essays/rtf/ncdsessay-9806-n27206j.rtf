I am just married, a housewife with one small child of 5 months and a husband of 27. We live in a small country cottage on the outskirts of [town]. It is 7 o'clock in the morning and a loud alarm bell wakes me up. I lie still in my bed untill my husband  brings me a cup of tea and a drink of milk for the baby, he is fully dressed and is smiling happily. Downstairs a sweet old housemaid is making a quick breakfast for him and my self and doing most of the housework. I crawl out of bed and carry the sleeping baby into my bedroom and give her a feed. I give her a small bath and put her back into bed after changing nappies and sheets. Afterwards I get dressed and run downstairs to a waiting breakfast of cereal, fruit juice, baked beans on toast and a cup of coffee, I thanked her kindly and went out to do some shopping in town while she looked after the baby and gets ready the lunch. I enjoyed very much the thought of looking in the shop windows, I walk up and down the highstreet looking for a nice dress to war to a dinner party that night at last I see one in [shop name], the very thing with imitation rubies round the neck and sleeves, I go in and buy it for 15 guineas. I think the dress is very suitable for a dinner party and I have done a reasonable mornings shopping.  Words: 259
