I would like to get marride and have a family. I shall try and get a job in a shop. I will enjoy my work very much. I will only work when my child or children are at school. I shall be very happy working at home. If I get a free afternoon, I will do some shopping with a friend. I'll alway's cook the meals that my husband likes, as well as I do. I will make my husband and children very happy and comfortablr in thier home, and when ever they are ill, I shall not go to work, but stay at home and look after them. I will always be friendly with my neighbours, if will be friendly with me. If they want, I will let my children have a friend in for tea, If ever I am ill, I would ask a friend if she would help.
