When I am 25 I would be a teacher. I would cook a lot and sew. If I got married I would sew and knit for my children. Sometimes I think I would like to be a dressmaker. I hope to have a boy and a girl. I would still read a lot as I like books. I would live in a flat or even a cottage. My husband will be rich. I will have a car and lots of lovely clothes. When I get older I will stop teaching and work in my house. I will not have too many friends as I might get tired of them. I will invite some of my friends to tea and I will chat with them. I hope to travel abroad with my husband and children and also go to France or Italy.
I will go to London to see the famous places and shops. I will draw in my spare time. Sometimes I might write a book on sewing hints and tips. I would like to spend a week in Guernsey or the Channel Islands. I will have a dog to guard my house and a kitten to keep me company. I will plan my house with care. I shall have three bedrooms, a kitchen, a living room, a lounge a spare room a bathroom and a playroom. I will have my living room furnished with an orange lamp, a book case, a sette with matching chairs a sunbeam fire and a telivision, radio, and paper stand. I think my house will be beautiful.
