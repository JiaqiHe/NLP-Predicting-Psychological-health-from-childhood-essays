I am 25 years old and I work at a riding school teaching young pupils to ride. Every evening I visit my friend and we talk about the days happening. My hobbies are reading swimming obviously horse riding and pyshical fitness My life is very enjoyable. Every morning at eight I get up and ride to the stables (I have my own horse) [name] a pupil is there waiting for me to organize the rides. She is one of my most forward coming riders. My family are very nice I have two sisters and one brother. They are all out at work and my Father and Mother now live in  a bungalow which we bought for them as an aniversary present. Every evening I go to night school as I have a permanent career as a waitress, in a mansion. I have dog which is an Alsation called Bruce, and I have a car, a morris 1,100 which I get to work in. (Eloped) my horse has just foaled and the foal is named Elopement. The dam is a race horse. I also like to go abroad to far away countries to get away from it all. In general the life I lead is very nice.  Words: 206
