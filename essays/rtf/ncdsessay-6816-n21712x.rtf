I am now 25 years old and I have got a job in army, and I fly a helicopter, and my job is to fly in men where they are readed when I am on  leave I make planes ships out of airfix and wood, I often go climing up rocks and mountians and they nealy all ways fly in anew batch of men on a Wendesday so that I must fly them out. I have a wife and three children there names are [Son's name], [Son's name] and [Daughter's name] and they all go to school. One is 5, 9, and 12, and they are very happy [Son's name] * is 12 wants to fly a helicopter like me and the ather two don't now what they want to do. but [Son's nickname] as we call him want to be a footballer like Goege best and want to play for Man United, my wife is a teacher and works at a School in [County]. And in 1 days time I will be back at the base starting up the engine. When I am ready to leave the force I am going to sing on to Man Uniterd, and become one of the best footballers in the game and then I will play untill somebody takes my place and then I will re*ire I will get a good job and I will then go and get good money and enjoment
If I dint not get a Job I would train as a footballer and after I get a job as a trainer I would train boys to play football fairl and like F. Lee of Man City would have to job. I think the job would be desining ships and planes, jet and cars with you have to jobs you get more money of course but apart from that you get more enjoment when you desined a plane and it goes up you are very proud.
