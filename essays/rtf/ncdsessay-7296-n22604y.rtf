When I am 25 I hope that I have a job and that I have atleast 3 children and a nice husband and I will go to work in the morning and come home in the after-noon. and i will not let any of my children hit* some one else if the other person did not hit them. I would take them for walks and take them to the town and I would only allow them to get a scerten amount of money a day. and I would not let them go out of the street with out me or some one big like their casanesar friends big sister. I would not go out and leave them in the house with their friend or their frends big sister. I woud'nt let me husband go out and drink because he might friten the children and the would screem, and my husbnad would get into bother and he might start a fight with me and the children could get hurted. I would like him not to drink or smoke and I think if he did not drik or not smoke we would be a verry happy family. And I hope he dose not swere. I would keep them neat a tiday and wold'nt let them go out without washing their face and combing the hair. And if their Ant or uncle was in they would have to go out and play. and they would not be allowed to give check up to some man or woman. And they would'nt be allowed to ask for money of anyone or I would hit them.  Words: 270
