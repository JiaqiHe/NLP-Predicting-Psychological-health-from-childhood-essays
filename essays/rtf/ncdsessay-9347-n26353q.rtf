I am in Scotland, starting my work as a docter, I am in the medical training centre here in Edingbourgh, the work here is very hard but I enjoy it. My main intrests are golf and cricket and I usually go down to the golf course here in my spare time.
I usually don't get into my house before nine and at dinner I only get a bite of a sandwich and a hasty cup of tea before I'm back on again. I live here as a bachelor although I have a few girlfreinds. Sometimes on Saturdays I tacke them out if I have time. The house is a semi-detached and is one the outskirts of Edingburough, my neighbours are indeed very kind and they supply me with all the things I want and when I run out.
They are a jolly young couple and always ask me round when there is a party on. I don't see much television although I see what I can when I come home from work. I go to bed mainly at about 11 but sometimes I stay late if there is a good film on.
The maypole (as I call my house) has six rooms and a cellar. In the cellar I keep all odd bits and pieces which might come in handy, also I use it as a fridge for milk ore something of that sort when I want to keep it cool. THe bedroom is rather small but large enough for me. The big French windows in the lounge let in a lot of sun and they lead out onto the lawn outside. The kitchen is just big enough to hold a cooker, sink and kitchen table, with enough space to move about in too.  Words: 291
