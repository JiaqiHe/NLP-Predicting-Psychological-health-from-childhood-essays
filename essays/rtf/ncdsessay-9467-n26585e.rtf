"I now work in a shop at hairdressing I enjoy this very much. In my spare time I take the children to the park and to the picture's I am leading a happy life and have been married for seven years, my husband work's at a factory where they make engines. I have some very nice customers come to my shop and also some not so nice ones like mrs [name] she has a very bad temper and speak's to you as though she hate's the sight of you I pity her poor husband he is nothing like his wife infact he is almost the oppasite he has a very good temper and always speaks to you nicely* never hardly speaks one harsh word, another of my bad customers is mrs [name] she speak's in a strict tone of voice and one of her favorite sentance's is ""hurry along girl we havn't got all day when I was a yound girl we * had to hurry up our we didn't half cop it"" her husbands even worse I was digging my garden one day and he walked up to my gate and said what a horrible lawn you have and just look as those flower's of your a absulute disgrace. But you ought to see his garden the lawn is covered in bare patches and he hasnt watered his flower for age's and age's. When I go swimming in my spare time I often see miss [name] she is a jolly good swimmer and is not married. Every sunday I go dancing at the locall club where a lot of my freind's are I take my husband with me as well sometime's we go to the role a drome my husband is an excellent skater and he is on ice. We leed a very happy life all of us."  Words: 309
