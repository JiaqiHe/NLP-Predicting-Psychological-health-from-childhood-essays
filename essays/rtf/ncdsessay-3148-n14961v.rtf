I am training in the Airforce. When I get leave I come home to visit. While at home I help with the housework. I look after the animals at home. I go out to the cinama with my friends. Then for about 1-2 hours aday I do my favorite hobby which is drawing. Back at the Airforce base I continue training. It is hard but enjoyable. I am aiming to be one* of the Devils. I am saving for a holiday in Hawia. My cousin is in with the airforce. The mascot is a chimpanze. I have flown a few times and parachuted 10 times. Once we had to get back to base going over 3 rivers with the enemy 1 hour behind. Of course the enemy were rely some of our group. Another time my lot were the enemy. Often the boys and I go swimming. I lead an enjoyable life its exciting adventures. I hope for the day when Im called into action.  Words: 165
