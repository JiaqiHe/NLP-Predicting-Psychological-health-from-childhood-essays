I am twenty five years old. My work is a doctor. I like my work. I do not do oporations but I visit the wards daily and If I am called out in the middle of the night I must go. I am also a batchelor and I have a dog called (name) it's a small terrier. I lead a very quiet life. I also have a cottage in the country and I go on holiday. as I am a doctor I have a daily routine in the morning I go round the patients then I do all the paper work by the time I have finished it is time to do the specimens then I go round the patients by that time the next doctor takes my place.
