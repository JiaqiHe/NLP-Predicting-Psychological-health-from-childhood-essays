----------------------
I live in a nice country house in Hertfordshire, I have a wife and 2 children and a Golden Labrador. I enjoy sailing very much and I own a small cruising yaght in which I go for weekends of sailing in Devon. I have a job as a barrister in London and so far I have been quite succesfull. 
My house is a two story detached house situated on a hill with about seven other similar houses, it is near [town]. I have two cars a Mini Cooper for my wife and a Triumph T.R. 4 for myself. Robbie (named after Robert Burns) is a Golden Labrador dog, he is two years old, we brought him when he was a pup. As well as sailing I like Veteran and Vintage motor cars, I think they have got charecter as indeed nearly all old things have, I hope to by one when I can aford it. money is a problem. My job as a barrister was really started by my Mummy and Daddy when I was just leaving my secondry school to go to Cambridge University where I studied law. 
My children, a boy and a girl named [male name] and [female name] (we call her Mary for short) are aged, [male name] 4, [female name] 3. I am at the moment building an extension to the kitchen with a play room adjoined. The double garage is at the end of our 1/4 acre garden, my wife is a very keen gardner, luckely for us because I hate it.  Words: 258
