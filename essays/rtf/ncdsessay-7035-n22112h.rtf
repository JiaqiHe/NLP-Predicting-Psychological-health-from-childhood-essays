I am a pupil nurse, training to be a doctor. Every thing is different now, my home (where I used to live) is sold and I have friends now (true friends). I like to give partys for children at the hospital.
Look! someone is coming in from a bonfire burn. I am in charge of a childres ward.
All the children here like me now. 
We have mechanised things now, though I do not approve of it being done.  Words: 77
