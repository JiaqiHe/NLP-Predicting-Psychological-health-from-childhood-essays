----------------------
I am leading a happy life after being married for seven years. We have now a nicely decorated house which has three rooms downstairs and four up. and have two children the girl six and the boy four.
My interests are sewing. When the children a a bit older I would like to try and get a job some where and that depend on what I am going to be. The job I would like would to be a teacher and then you would be on holiday when the children were.
I enjoy my home life very much.  Words: 96
