"""Work! Work! Work! Thats just about all I do now I'm married. I will go to that night club. Washing [male name]'s dirty shirts every day, dusting, washing up, he never lifts a finger to help. And those hefty great beds oh I shudder to think of them. I'll just finish the washing up and them I'm going out. [female name] will go out with me. 
Oh! I've just remembered. I've got to do my entry for art competion. I'll do it in oils. Now a harbour wall and a fishing fleet coming in. The sun setting behind the cliff. There! I'll finish it off. tomorrow.
Marion let's go to the church and so some brass rubbings. There is a good one of St George. 
Hang on I'm just coming. Don't forget to bring your chalk and paper. Get in the car [female name]. Oh can you drive? Yes I passed my test a week ago. Congratulations. Thanks a lot. Oh by the way can you come to the night club? I expect so if [male name] can cook his own supper.
I am enjoying myself, have you ever taken plaster casts. No how do you do it. I'll tell you tonight. These brasses are good aren't they. Yes they are. I like the pattern on the sword and shield. Very fiddly though aren't they?"  Words: 223
