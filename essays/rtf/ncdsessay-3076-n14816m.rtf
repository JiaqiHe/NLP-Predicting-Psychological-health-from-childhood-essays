When I grow up I will be a hair dresser. I will run a little shop of my own. The closing days are Tuesday and Saturday afternoon. I open the shop at half past eight am, and close a half past six p.m. My price for old age penseners is cheapper. I go abroad every year with my husband and I take my Mother and Father with me. I have a dog called Penny. In the evenings after work I have my tea and go either to the cinamar or to a dance with my husband. On Tuesday I go to my Mother and Fathers in the afternoon and on Saturday I will do the shopping and then we, my husband and I go to my husbands parents. We have a car and we can both drive.
