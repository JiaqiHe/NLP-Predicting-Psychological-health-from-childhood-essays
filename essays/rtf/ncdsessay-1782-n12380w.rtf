My name is [female name] I live in [London suburb]. My job is a teacher at a Junior school. I do not get much wages but I am happy. I was born at [hospital name] Hospital. When I was young I wanted to grow up and wear makeup and fashionable shoes not dull horrid shoes. I realise now that you grow up all too soon. At weekends I go out in my car with my family. My hobbies include Fencing swimming and dancing When I was at college I had many friends and I went to a lot of dances. One night The Hollies were coming to our college and everybody was excited. Afirst when I cam to the school to teach I was very nervous because all the children were watching me. At college I learnt to play the piano the flute and viola. The school were I work is at Bush Hill Park school. When I go in class and start to teach usally one person tries to be silly. Some children are not as bright as others and can't keep up but I had to learn to be patient with them. In art lesson children make a mess so I make them clear it up. I find that children have very imaginative minds and write good compositions, but some are not as good as others.  Words: 228
