Now Iam 25 I have made up my mind to be an all round sports man like running and football and scrable and rug*r. I'm going to train to be an egineer in my spare time I'm not going to get married untill I'm about 30. I manage to keep the house tiydyand do my own cooking without any help at all. In some of my spare time I mange to get a bit of training like runing on the spot and skipping and things like that . I live in a semi detatched house and the neabour are quit nice I think abut geting married but I say no becaus - e my wife wouldent see me much I'd be away nearly all the time. so when I'm 30 I'm packing the job up and getting a simple job like an enginear. I go to all the events that I know the next olimpics that come out I'm going to try and enter for all of the I'* got lods of medal and I'm proud of them I'* got about 13 cetificates 10 cups and 6 medals I'm a very good engineer now I'm poffechonal I had to have an exsam the other day and I passed **at makes 14 certific**-tes in my cabinate I'* got 2 silver medals 3 gold medal and 1 bronze medal I alway think back to the good old days when I won them and I try even harder to win thigs. I was in hospital for a few weeks with inj urys from rugar and football and all **** men were a**ing for my autogra*h so they put me in a prurat room I liked it there beca*e it saved me from cooking my own dinner. when I was let out I was sorry to leave the palce .
