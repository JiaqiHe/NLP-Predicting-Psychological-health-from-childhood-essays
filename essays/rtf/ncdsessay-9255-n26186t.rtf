This is the year 1983 I am twenty five years of age. I just became twenty five on [date of birth]. I am working in an office with twenty women and twenty men. I am now typing out a letter for my boss. It is for the head of typing to ask him for more assistants. From my house I walk down [hill] for the bus it takes twenty minutes to get to work. I work at a place called [bank]. I work upstairs on the top flight. When I go home I will start knitting a dress for myself, then when I have finished a bit of it I will watch television. I start work at nine o'clock a.m. and finish at six thirty p.m. I type a hundred letters a day, some times sixty or seventy but usually a hundred. On friday after-noon I go out and post the Letters that I typed and then I go home.  Words: 160
