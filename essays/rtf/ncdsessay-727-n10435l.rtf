I'm a Furniture lorry driver. and I like to go all over England, Scootland and wales. I live in a house that I bought my selve. My main interest is to be a footballer. I like to see new places and not to stay in one place all the time . I now a lot about enginering and when I have time a like to fiddle about with engines . When I got to seaside places in my lorry I take my brother . And of a sunday I like to play football with my mates . All my palls go down to the pub for a drink, but I never go down for a drink, I only drink or smoke at Christmas , and I hardly ever go out . When I can ever get overtime I alway's get it .
