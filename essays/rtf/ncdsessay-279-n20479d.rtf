MY work is a housewife, and I help people who has got big houses and can not manegs to do all of their work. And sometimes if I have any time to spare I go and doic the garden and put the seeds in. If I do the garden when it is near tea time it is one mad roocs [rush] to get the tea ready. I would like to go in a facree [factory] and work there but I can not because I have not got the time to go in to a facree because I would come home from the facree and I would not have time to do the house work there would be dust all over the place. I have got a house by myslef I am maread I have not got any childen My home is very nice. I come home from work at 1 o clock and I start at 8 o clock and when I come home I have time to do the house and other job what I want to do for myslef. The Job I like doing best is cleaning the window and feeding the dog. Those are the best two I like and the other job are not so good as the other two. And I like planting seeds and watering them and when they come up they look nice. I like planting seeds in the house best I do not like planting them outside much, I like planting them inside best. I like going to town as well  Words: 259
