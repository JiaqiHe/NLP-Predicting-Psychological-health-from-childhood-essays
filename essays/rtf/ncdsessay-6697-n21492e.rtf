At the age of 25 I am enjoying my career of dancing (modern).
I enjoyed dancing as a small child and used to take lessons. After a number of these lessons I obtained a scholarship for '[school]', (a famous school for mainly dancing, but with other interests). I worked hard there, but it was all worth while for I enjoy my career immensly.
I work, on average, 5 days a week, but occasionaly, having my my weekends booked for some kind of show. I have a weekly income of xxxx50, which you may not think much, considering the present cost of living, but I benefit greatly as regard's clothes, shoes, handbags etc. Also, its not really the money that rewards me, but the sheer enjoyment of dancing. The cloths etc. I do obtain are really fab and my wardrobe is bursting with them.
In my own private life, i am engaged to an extremly nice man, to whom I shall soon be married. When we are married, I intend to give up my career and have children, of which I am very fond. I really live an exceptionally happy life and, if I give up my career for my future husband, and I hope children, I shall be quite happy to do so.  Words: 210
