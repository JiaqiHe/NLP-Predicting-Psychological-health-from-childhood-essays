I am twenty five and. I work at east anglia police station. I am a sargent and have had many arrestes and my mate. Sargent **** and where out in a parela*. When we saw rock finger the most dangerous crook in the world. So we got after him and he went to his hide out and we arrested him son thats why we are sargents and I live in cottan man. Sometimes I go out to direct traffic. Or go to foot ball matches. But it is a nice life being a police man. But when we have reports about lost children we take. The dogs out my favor*t dog is charlie a two year old Alsation. He has made quite a *ew aresst* he usely comes with me. when you become a sargent you have to take tests and if you pass you become sargent. But some times you stay in the staition and do not get much some nights you have to stay up all night long. But you get quite a long holiday about 3 weeks and. I have been at many a football matches where there are struggles. It is anice house I have in cottan ham and a nice nabour hood I have many freinds there. And so on I hope to pass my exam to become a detective and you get more pay and theirs another thing the police do they go to accidents and get people out of crushed cars clear the roads some times the accidents make you feel sick but. After you have seen some you get used to them. And a police man is licke a doctor too. beacause in sombody reallty neads a doctor badly.  Words: 287
