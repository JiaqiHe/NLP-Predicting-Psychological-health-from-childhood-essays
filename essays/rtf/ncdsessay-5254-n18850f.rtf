At the age of twenty-five I might be training as a piolot for passenger, helicopter of any other job that concernes flying. Maybe driving a car if I had one to drive. At dinner time get somthing to eat. If I went on holiday it would most likely by underwater swimming.  I would save quite a lot of the money I got from my job. I would watch football quite often on the television and a few other programes.  Words: 79
