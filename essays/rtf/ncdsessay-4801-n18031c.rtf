I am leading a super up to date life at the age of 25. I wear most of the modern clothes. My interests are looking after my husband and my child (an adopted handicapped girl) who name is [female name] (pron. [female name]) I love taking our pet dog 'Bingo' out for walk (a Golden Labrador). Another interest is raising money for all hanicaped children. My home life is super. We are always finding many excitng things in our old house and its' grounds. (It is situated in the country). I love doing the decorating. My husband and I have hardly any quarrels, this is not only because of the fear of upsetting our daughter, it is also because we hardly ever have the time. We cherish our daughter more than anything in the world. We take her out in the car every single day, and she has plenty of friends living near us, and she gets awfully upset if even one does not turn up. I work as the Headmistress of a school for handicaped children. I am a qualified nurse and teacher (as I have taken both courses), so I may teach the children whenever I want to. I have one ambition and that is to open up a special school for unwanted and orphaned handicaped children.  Words: 219
