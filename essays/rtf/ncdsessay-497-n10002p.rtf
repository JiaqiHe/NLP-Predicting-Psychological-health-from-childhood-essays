The dog pounded up at me when i reached for her lead. I tkae the dog out nearly every night and then have a nice cup of coffee when I come back. In the morning I have to get up at 1/4 past severn to open the garage up. It's quite a large place really, the lot of ground measures about 7 acres most of it is car park's and garage's where I keep the car's I have to repair and the stock-driving cars. All yes I have to drive the dragsters at Romesy, its very dangerous but its good fun. In the summer I have to do a lot of grass cutting as I have the caravan site to keep down. I go to thruxton quite often to maintain [male name] [surname]s Ferrari Berlinatat. [male name]s an old school pal who use to be in the same form as me, we use to have good fun togethr. In the Autumn I have two weeks holiday abroad I usally go to Majorca and spain. The firm JCB is a lorry transporters. I sometimes drive the lorries from Edinburh to Cornwall. Apart from these hobbies I lead quite a normal life.  Words: 200
