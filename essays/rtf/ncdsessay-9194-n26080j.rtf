I am 25 years old, and I work at [company] Hair dressers. In my spare time I play in an orchestra. My husbands name is [name] he composes our music. I have a daughter who is 1 year old, and I am teaching her to play the piano, violin, and flute. My favourite hobbies are dress making, drawing, and painting. I am thinking of becoming a Ballarina and dansing the leading role in Swan Lake the famous Ballarina which is playing the role now is margot Fontain. I have wrote to the company to ask if I could join the company and my answer should arrive in the morning post tomorrow. I am hoping that they will allow me to join. I will go for a months training were Margot Fontain had once trained. Next morning I ran down stairs to look through the morning post at last I found a letter adressed to me. I quickly opend it with my hands shaking with excitment after I had read it I jumped with joy they had allowed me to join. I ran up to tell [name] and [name]. [name] wanted to come with me, but I said she couldn't and that she could come and see once a week. I start my training this afternoon with quite alot of others. After a months training I did manage to get a part in the Swan Lake but it wasnt the leading role. Once a week [name] came and visit me.  Words: 249
