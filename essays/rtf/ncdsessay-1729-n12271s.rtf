I would most probly go to evening classes for swimming dress making and other things. Before I went to evening classes I would get the dinner on. On some nights I'd go over my freinds house to have tea. I'd work in a office from 9.30 to 5.30. On Sunday's I'd go out to the pictures or to a show. I would be home at about 11 o'clock so I would not get up late for work the next day. For my work I would do petty cash and work on a typewriter. On a Saturday I would go to a market like [road], [road] or [town]. Indoors I would look at my stamp collectcien and my coin collectcien. I might get some mateariel on Saturday and make some clothes for myself and I'd get up early every morning and make myself a big breakfast. Of a Saturday morning I would work in a shop. I might take a baby over the park on a Sunday morning if it was sunny. For my holidays I'd go to a holiday camp with some frenids. Or I'd go to my nan's in [city].
