My interests are knitting and sewing. also I would like to be a ballet teacher and dancer. in the evening I sit and watch television after the tea things have been washed up. Sometimes I might read or perharps have a late dancing lesson. Some morning I'd go shopping and in the afternoon go dancing. at home the life is very easy all the afternoon I'm out so I come back and get my tea and after that tidy up the rooms. I would also like to be a nanny and look after children but I'd rather be dancing. if I looked after children i would like them to be from about the age of 4 to 10. If I was a nanny I would probably live with them or near them. I wouldn't mind iif they were younger than four because I could always take them out in the pram or pushchair for a walk.
I wouldn'nt mind being a hairdresser wither, if I was it would only be part time, perharps just on a saturday and I'd do some other job the rest of the week.  Words: 187
