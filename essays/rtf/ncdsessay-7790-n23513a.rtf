When I am 25 I would probally be married and go to work as an architect In [town]. My form would be Y.J. [surname] and I would drive to work in my Hillman Super Minx.
Every morning I would get up at 7.O Clock a.m. Get washed have a cup of tea, and get dressed while my wife made the breakfast, which would be Weetabix and hot milk, buttered toast, and a boiled egg. To drink I would have a cup of tea with one spoonful of Sugar. I am out of the house by half past eight a.m. and in work by 9.30 a.m. Where I get on with the drawing that I had not finished yesterday. I have a cup of coffee and 2 chocolate biscuits for break and by one o clock pm I had finished the drawing. So I went two lunch in a restaraunt in [town], I had meat, Roast potatoes, peas, cabbage, and mint sauce, for dinner, and for pudding I had Apple tart and custard. To drink I had a cup of tea with sugar, altogether the bill came to 12/- so I gave him 6 luncheon vouchers. When I get back to the office I start on the drawing of a block of flats for Grenwich Square.
At weekends I go shopping In [London suburb], and In the afternoon I watch [town] play football. On Sundays I go to 8 o clock a.m. mass and do gardening in the morning, and I go out with my wife in the car in the afternoon.  Words: 259
