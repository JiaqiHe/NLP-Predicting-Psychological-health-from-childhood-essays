If I was twenty five and not marryed I would be working. I would put about two pound in the bank every week. when I had two hundred pound in the bank, I would draw it out and buy a car or a motor bike. and I would polish the boke or the car every week. and keep it in good condishon. I would buy a pet such as a dog and name it Tex, and Then buy a license I would take the dog for a walk every day and teach it to fetch my news paper. when it comes to July, the summer Holidays I would buy a caravan with my savings and go to Gernsey and stay there a week, and Then go to [town] for a week and then to [town] for another week and so on.
