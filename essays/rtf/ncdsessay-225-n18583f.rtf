I am 25 years old, and live in [xxxxxxx]. I work as a dress designer for a firm called '[xxxxxxx].' The firm had just been open a year. I start work at 9 o'clock and finish at 5 o'clock. I share a flat with my friend Joan. Joan also works as a dress designer. We have Wednesday afternoons and all day Saturdays off In this time I like to read, go for walks and go shopping. At [xxxxxxx], I design a dress, coat, trousers etc. and then pass them on to a girl next to me who draws and cuts out the patern and then she passes it on to somebody next to her who make's the item, and then it goes to the department who sells the clothes. I like working as a dress designer, as it is quite simple. All you have to do is draw a dress, etc. put what fabric its made of what colour and what it is suitable for. Joan and I take it in turn's to do the shopping. We always go to 'Tescos' as we find we can get good food at a low price. We also take it in turns to cook. Every Tuesday and Thursday I go to Night School to learn language's.  Words: 213
