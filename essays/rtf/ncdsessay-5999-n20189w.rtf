When I am 25 years old I hope that I will have a good job, I would not mind being a hair-dresser or work in a office. I may be living still with Mum and Dad or I may have a home to my-self. If I do have a home to my-self I would try and get one in the country so that I could keep pets. My interests would be sewing and Bellringing may be I would have some more which I have not got now. I do not think I would go out must in the evenings. I would not like to live in the town very much for there is not much to do but roam around the streets and town. I would not to live away from everyone but not to many people, I may go on holiday in the summer if I did I would go abroad if I had the right money. I would like to learn to ride a horse and have one of my own. Each day I would ride on the lanes and around it's field, If I was a hair-dresser I would like combing it best.  Words: 196
