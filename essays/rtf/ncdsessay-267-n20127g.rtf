I am a fireman, I help to put out fires sometimes My days of is Monday and Wednesdays. I like to drive the fire brigdage. My money is good I get payed on Thursdays. When I come home from working at half-past six I get super. Then after super is over, I read books then I go to bed about half past nine. I have a good night's sleep. Then I waken up at half past seven refreshed and ready for work again. My hobby is collecting pennies from the reign of Queen Victorrai to King George VI.  Words: 98
