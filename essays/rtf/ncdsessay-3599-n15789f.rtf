At home I would take my Family to the Country for the Easter holidays, I would tkae them to Norfolk. And in the Summer Sometimes I would take them Camping abroad, and other times I would take them anywhere not to crowded along the English Coast. I would Stay at home for Christmas. On Sunday or on days I am not working I would take my children out to Parks and teach them how to Swim and row. I would not buy them a bycicle untill they were nine.
My own interests would be Rugby, and carrying on making models. I would try to play for England in Rugger, and I would make model aircrafts to race. I would let my Children help me make these things.
