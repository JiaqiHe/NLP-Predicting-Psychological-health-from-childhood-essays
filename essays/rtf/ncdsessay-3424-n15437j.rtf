I am twenty five years old I start of my day getting up in morning or half past seven I get dressed and have my break-fast.
I then put my coat on and s** of for work.
I work at [company] as an shop assitante
I stay on the stall untill twelve oclock I have my dinner, then start back to work. At half three I set of for home 
When I arrive home I do a bit of dusting and tiding the house up about fourish I start to cook a cooked tea for my husband. He comes home about five
It is a Thursday today and my husband and I go to our moms and dads house we take them to a bingo club some-times they some times win a ticket or two and they pick some-thing of there choice then we take them home. One day a lady brought back some towels she said just in one week they got torn I said well Im sorry you'll have to talk to the maneger about this but sahe still carried on saying it was my fault. At last I got her to go to the manger he gave her a new set of towels.
Sometimes I like to make a new nesapea but it usauly comes out wrong. On some nights I go to the pictures with my husband. But when I've got nothing to do I just try and finish a juper or cardigon.  Words: 242
