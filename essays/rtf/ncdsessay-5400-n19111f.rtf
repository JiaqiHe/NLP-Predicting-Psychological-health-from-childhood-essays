My day would probably start at half past seven, when I would get up and dress ready to go to my Teacher's Training College. At College I would study to become a teacher. I would like to teach children of about 8 or 9 years old; but if this was not possible I would train to be an English teacher in a Senior school I would probably lodge or live with my parents at this time, but around this age I intend to get married, settle down and have a family; that is, if I find the right man. After this I would take a part-time job as a teacher. I don't believe that you can bring up a young family properly if you are always at school all day, and in the evenings when you can enjoy a bit of peace and quiet, get bogged down with marking books, and not give enough attention to your children (Not that I would spoil them if I was at home) I would probably spend a lot of time reading or studying. I would very much enjoy an occaisonal trip to Covent Garden to see a ballet, especially the Nutcracker Suite or Coppelia. I would like a Saturday afternoon swim as I am fond of this sort of thing. I might even manage a game of tennis.
My house would be very clean and tidy, but not prim-looking. The garden would be well-cared for and full of daffodils and roses, at the appropriate times of the year. I would grow lots of vegetables and fruits such as crabapples, plums, cherries etc. Altogether I think I would enjoy my life immensly at the age of 25.  Words: 282
