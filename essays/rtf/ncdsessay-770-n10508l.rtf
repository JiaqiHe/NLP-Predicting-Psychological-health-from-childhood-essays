Last week it was my twenty fifth birthday I treated myself to a new car. I can afford because I'm still single. I don't think I will get married this way I can keep my job which gets me enough income to get food, clothes and pay for my flat and then I put a bit in the bank. I have a good enough job at the docks it gets me twenty five pound basic wages and I can run a car as well. My mate [name] put his foot in it he met a girl and after two or three weeks and got married not me though. I often go in for swimming contests against the lads down at the local baths. And I make model airoplanes so I can put a certain amount of fuel in and it will fly. My mate [name] is doing well at university now. I never even made it to grammer. Right now I am thinking of putting in for the pub down the road. I have six hundred pounds in bonds so I think I will qualify for it. Down at the docks I'm clerk in the office its not a hard job I can do it fairly well. I have to sign for the goods which we recieve and collect and sort out the wages. At home I have a flat which costs me five pounds a fortnight it has a sitting room a bedroom and a bathroom it is next to the top, of a twenty storey building.  Words: 258
