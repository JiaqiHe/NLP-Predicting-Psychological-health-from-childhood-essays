At last I am 25 and I am going to paint a picture of a wedding and put it on show at an art gallary and if it was god I would paint for the rest of my life and get a lot of money and in my spare time when I am not painting I will ride a horse and enter horse show or help my mum.
I like panting animals and people but not trees becuase they are fiddlie. With the money I get I would spend on a hoilday to Ireland where I have an auntie. She is very kind to me and I want to pay her back for all the kindness she gave me in my childhood and when my parants were dead I would buy them a toomstone in a shape of a cross with a big capitall letters saying A [surname] DIEAD in what ever date she died.
