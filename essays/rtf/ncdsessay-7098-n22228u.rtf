And my wages was 39xxxx. The party was next week (on a Sat.) When I got home I saw that the house was dirty the baby which was 3 months old was on the floor wriggling around. My older boy which was 12 was trying to tidy the place up. But my daughter which was 16 was up stairs getting ready for her boyfriend she had the record player blazing off.
