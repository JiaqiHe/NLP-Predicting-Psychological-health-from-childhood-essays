I am interesting in aeroplanes but it is too risky to try it. So I became an electrician and travel all over the town. I live in a flat and have two children. I lead a happy life and have lots of friends. We go to the pub now and then for a drink. I am also interested in photography and I have got four cameras. I do house-work on Saturday morning and go to watch **** in the afternoon with my friends. On Sundays my family go out for a ride* in a Cortina Estate car. On Monday I get up at half past six and get ready for work. Sometimes I have a week off and take my family on a little holliday. I also like driving big oil tankers, so I go down to my dad he lets me drive an esso tanker. My best interest is motor racing, so on the gold cup. I go to **** Park. I go to first-aid on Friday night because of anybody at work gets badly indured I can see to them and get a pay rise. We also go on picnics sometimes. When I have nothing to do on a Saturday and the football seasons ended I play cricket. I don't no much about it but I just play. I sometimes paint and draw and hang my paintings up, they are not very good though. I get 10 pounds a week for being an electrician and I think more people should be one. It is an interesting job and I like it. Motor racing is also too dangerous and too fast. A **** aeroport we go in a monoplane and fly round the airport.  Words: 285
