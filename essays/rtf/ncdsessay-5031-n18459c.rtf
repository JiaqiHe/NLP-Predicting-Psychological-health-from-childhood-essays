I may be married then. I may be an hair dresser. I would give my parents half of my wages. Put half the money I have left in the Bank. If I have children I would give them half a crown each for pocket money. I would have long hair. Every Thursday I would get a baby sitter so that my husband and I could go to a club or to a dance. I would go to church every sunday. If I had children they would go to the same school as I did. If I had a boy and a girl I would like the girl to be older than the boy, so that the boy would not boss the girl about. When they get home work I would make sure they did it the night they got it. When the children have * left primary school I would go to live in Australia to live. I would like my daughter to be a hair dresser like myself and my son. The daughter would help me with my house work my son would help my husband with his odd jobs. I would like a house in the country. I would let them have at leased 3 hobbies.  Words: 208
