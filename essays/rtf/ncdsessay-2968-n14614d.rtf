When I am about 18 1/2 Iwill get a good job and by the time I am 20 I will perhaps by a caravan let it out to people and live in a flat and pay, how much a week, and when I am 25 I should have enough money to by a house. and my interests would be a stamp collector and a aqrist. I shall buy a car an old one such as a Ford capri and then I shall get a better one. My job shall be a paper-round or a milkman and then I shall by a cheap shop and then I shall be an owner.
