When I am 25 I would like to be marraght and have one chilled. On the night if I could get some one to look after the chilled I would go to work to try to get in some money. I would see if I could get a Job in a cimea. When the chilled is five I shall see if I can get a Job gurring the* afernoon. And get home for when the chilled comes back home from School. I Shall proply go out once a week if I could. But if I can not get a Job in a cimmea I shall see if I can get a Job in a shope. and when the chilled go,s in to the next school which shall be the Juneyer I shall leave work and stay in the house.
      I shall proply live in a flat and put my money in the bank for when I neat it and we shall live on the money which my husdand gets. Evry week I shall give my chilled some money to put in to a bank so when she grow,s up she shall have some money put a side for when she get,s marage and have chilled of her own. Evry week I shall visset my mother and my sisters. and some time,s I'll go and see my brother,s.
