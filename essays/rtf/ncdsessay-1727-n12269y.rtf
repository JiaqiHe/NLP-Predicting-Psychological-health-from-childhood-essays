I am leading quiet a good life I work at a garage as a mecanick. The pay is good and I enjoy it as a job. I have my own house in the city it is quit a big house two storyies hy and 50ft long. I Sometimes go out of a night to have a drink at the po*b. Then sometimes I go to a restrant for a night. My friends sometimes come round to my house on a weekend to ask if I can do a job on there car for them. When I do the jobs they pay me a bit of money for doing the job. Being a mechanick isent a dool life at all, It is a good job and I will not change from it. Some weekends we go down to a club to pay football or chricket or tennis.  Words: 146
