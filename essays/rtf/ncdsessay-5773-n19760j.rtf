I live in manchester and I are not married. I am a footballer for a local pub. I enjoy playing foot ball I hope to play for a big clup one day. During the week I work  for the RSPCA. In the dogs division I look after the dogs and feed them. I have got a dog myself. One day when I was training and I heard that a Manchester Unted scout was going to watch me play. I played my best on saturday. Two weeks later I had a letter from Matt Busby saying he wanter* to see me play. So I went and told him that he could see mee play. when he had saw me play. He wanted to sigh me for the reserve team. I exepted the offer and signed on the paper. When I got home I told my dog he barked as if he understood what I said. That night I went to the put which I did every night and told them the news we celabrated with drinks on the house. After this I played darts. The next day I told my parents who lived in a town just outside Manchester. They were delighted. I thought that I might get into the first team and I might have a great carea. I gave up my work and just trained two days a week. I made a hobby this was collecting coins.  Words: 238
