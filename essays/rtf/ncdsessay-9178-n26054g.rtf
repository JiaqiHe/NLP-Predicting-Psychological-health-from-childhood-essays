I am twenty 5 years old. I work at a pony club. Every day, I muck out the stables and feed the ponies*. That is not my onley job. I work on Saturday afternoons, at the flower shop. When I go on holiday, I uselly like to go to a farm. Sometimes of I save up anougth I ago abroad. Uselly I live with my parents but sometimes I live with my freind. (we share a flat) My best pet is my rabbit sqeaker. He is black, with white paws and tail. When I go to the pony club I uselly look after the offcie, and, people come in to hire ponies. Then I uselly have give them a lesson. My favarite pony is Copper She is a chesnut colar. I look after her foal And the cheif (the head) says, I look after very well and I could have it, but leave it at the stables. In my spare time I read and do Art.
