If I was 25 years old I would propably be taking a teaching corse for my work anyway. I would want to live in Austria I think because my Aunt and Uncle have been there and they have told me it is a very nice place to live. I would go and live there. Each day I would probaly enjoy going in the swimming pool to get me awake first then go on to my job of teaching.
My interests in home life would be to get married and have children, I do not think I would want to have more than two children at once because it would be quite a handful if they were young and I had to go to work. My husband would go to work and he is a draughtsman. I would leave my children with my Mum and Dad to look after if they would like to look after them. 
My hobbies would be ballroom danceing, Swimming and collekting stamps. If I could take danceing lessons I would, and I would get my husband interested in it as well then we could go in for competitions. I would also go swimming and take my children with me.
I would dress in a fashionable way but I would not wear very mini skirts because I would not suit them I would grow my hair long to about my shoulder and keep having it trimmed so it would be nice and thick. Another thing which I would do in my spare time was dress making. These are the things I would do if I was 25 years old.  Words: 270
