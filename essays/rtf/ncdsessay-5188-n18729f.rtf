I come home at odd times but I am usealy home before them. I am mostly an actress and I have just left drama school. I like window shopping for the family and myself. I also like watching films and playing. records. When I come home I usely cook a big tea unless my husband and I were at home for dinners the children stay to school for dinners. We have my mother and father over for tea once every two weeks same with my husbands. The children have a tea party once every month.  Words: 141
