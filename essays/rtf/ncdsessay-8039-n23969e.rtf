When I am 25 years old, I hope I will be a Welfare Officer. Now I am a qualified Welfare Officer and I am married but have no children. Today I am going to the Orphanage to try to find a home for twins, when I am not working I like to knit jumpers, cardigans, skirts etc for the children in the orphanage. To be a Welfare Officer I had to have five O' levels, after my years at [school] I went to College and there I trained and sat my O' levels. Today I didn't find a home for the twins but tommorow I will try again. I am working in [city] where a lot of children are left on doorsteps and abandoned, only today a child was brought into the orphanage who's parents had been killed in a car crash. Every month we have about fifty children. brought to the orphanage, I work all week except on a Sunday that is when I spend the day with my husband. I hope to have a little girl of my own next year but I am not going to give my job up altogether I am going to work on a Monday Wednesday and Friday. I have just gone *** and have a little girl of my own named [name] who is two months old today, and I still have my job.  Words: 232
