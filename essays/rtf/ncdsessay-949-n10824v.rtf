I am now twenty five years old and I work in a lawers office as a shorthand typist . On a saturday I sometimes carry out some of my hobbies e.g. swimming and reading. On a saturday night I sometimes go out with my girlfriend to the pictures or the dancing. On a sunday I am a teacher in the sunday school I enjoy this very much. One of my favourite stories to read to the children is the prodigal son. It is about a boy who is bored living with his father and brother and decides to leave home so he asks his father to give him his share of money which he would get when his father died . His father gives him the money and he sets off on his journey He wastes his money and he finds that when his friends realise that he has no money they all leave him . Soon he has to look for work. A while later he decides that he will go back home and ask his father to forgive him and his father does this . After sunday school when I go home I sometimes go for a run in my car . to the country. In the country I like to take a long walk to see the beautiful and interesting thingst there e.g. the scenery of the country, the birds and many other things. My friend also likes birds and keeps some . They all have nice colours and some of them have very interesting colours. On the whole I think that I lead a very enjoyable and interesting life.
