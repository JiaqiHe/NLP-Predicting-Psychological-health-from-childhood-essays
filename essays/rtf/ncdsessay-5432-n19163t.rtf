I am now playing football as a poffesional. I enjoy it I have a good wage and I am married I have one boy, I also work in the week for a sports shop. I enjoy my life and I am *ding a good c*. 
My life at home is good to. I have a dog which is well trained. I help out with some house work on Sundays. 
          Sometimes I go w* my family out Sunday afternoons. 
         I go on a holiday every year, when the football season is finished. With one child I usually fly. My family like flying although we can't fly every year, 
          Twenty five years old seems young to me but I will still keep on going till I have a retier. I other people d*g. 
          I hope to go on playing football until I have to retire. When I retier I will do all I posibly can do for my wife and my child.  Words: 164
