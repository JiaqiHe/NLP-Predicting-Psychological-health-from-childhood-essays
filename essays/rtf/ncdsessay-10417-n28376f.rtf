When I go to work I hope to be a stone mason, an Archetect, a Joiner, a teacher, a farmer or a builder. I would like to be able to drive a car. If I had plenty of money I would go to Yugoslavia, Ireland, France, Germany, Finland, Sweeden, Norway and the rest of Europe for my holidays. I would keep on collecting stamps and coins and proboberly get more hobbies. If I was a teacher in a Secondry or a Grammer school I would like to teach Geography, Arithmetic, Science or be a swimming Instructor. If I was a builder I would go with one or two others, so that the quicker we finished a job the more money we would get. I would have a biggish house and plenty of children. If I didn't get any of the other jobs I would probobely be a shop-keeper and I would sell things such as food, sweets, sports things, things for hobbies, (not ordinary stamps), Gardening things, and pleasure and holiday things. If I was a Joiner I would probobely make furniture and models, and if I was a farmer I would have all kinds of animals.  Words: 197
