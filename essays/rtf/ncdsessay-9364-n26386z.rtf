I am a draughtsman and I live in [town] in Cornwall. My house is thoroly modern with BBC.3 and many other gadgits. I am a bacholor which pleases me very much as I dont have presents to buy for a wife. My life is much* different than it was as a boy. Being high up in a draughtmans life I go to many contries I disign eylenders. The contries I have been to so far are Germany and Russia. I have got a triumph vitesse and I have got an austin mini in which I race in ralleys in my spare time. I have won about xxxx500 in the three years I have been racing in Motor Cross. At the moment my main ambition in life is to sell this house and buy another only in Bounmouth I thougholy enjoy my work as I have got lots of mates. Although I enjoy myself I would like to be a boy once more.  Words: 162
