I have got new job . I am a vet . I decided to be a vet because I love animals . I have been married for two years and I have one child. My hobbies are swimming, Judo, and horse - riding. My house is beautiful it has an out-door swimming pool . Soon we will be going our holidays to Spain and other foreign countrys. I came back just a few days ago from my holidays, it was great. Now I have to go back to work . My husband is a enginerer . We ern quite a lot of money. We have got a new car , it is a Triumph Herald. This is my day off. I can go to the town for a change. Tonight I go horse-riding. I have to jump over the jumps . The menager has gave me a certficate for jumping 5ft 6ins . He said I could go in for some competitions . After hors-riding I go to Judo. That is on of my best hobbies . I come home at 10.25 . Time to go to bed . It has been a good day.  Words: 195
