My interests are on collecting coins and maybe modelling. When I am twenty five I suppose I will keep on collecting coins and modelling models of animals. My home would be in the country where it was quiet and I could observe animals and also birds. I would maybe grow a few bushy trees where birds could nest and lay there eggs. I would probably grow a lot of different flowers and sh***s and also have a small lawn.I would have a bee hive and collect the honey when it was ready, My work would probably be about birds, animals, and maybe somehting about fishing. Mostly I would like my work to be something about fishing. I would like it to be about fishing because I fish quite a long time at river or stream sides and my father says I have the pations for it.I do not know which job is connected with fishing. If I could not find a job connected with fish I am sure I would find one connected with animals and birds.  Words: 177
