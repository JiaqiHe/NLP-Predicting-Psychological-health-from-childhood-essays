I am training for European champion-ships in (place). I am flying out to (place) on January 19th. Training at (place), I train for 5 hours per day. My mother is making a skating dress for me the colour is yellow and black. At last the day has come for me to go. I arrived in the early morning so there is time to do some sight-seeing. I waved for a taxi. The taxi took me all over the city and dropped me off at the Ice Rink. All ready the ques for seats were building up. I got dressed and there was some same time before the doors were open . I could go on the ice to practise some difficults jumps. The European championships begin. First on the ice was a German girl whose marks were not very good . Then a Swedish girl who was a little bit better. Now it was me. My marks were 5.8, 5.9, 5.8, 5.9 . I felt sure that the Norwegian would beat me but I was wrong the Norwegian was third, and I was first.  Words: 184
