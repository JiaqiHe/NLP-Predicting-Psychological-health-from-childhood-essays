My main interest is usualy stopped by my two children who are always pestering me to play games with them. 
     My job is to play left wing for manchester united, last week we took the F.A. cup with us. We were playing against West Ham and we beat them six nil. They kicked off first and one of our men rushed foreward and took the ball of the enemy, ran upfield and scored. 
     Home life is good. I have two daughters one who is three and the other, two. We are quite happy where we are but we are thinking of imigrating to Australia because the country is in such a bad position and manchester united would have been in the second division if they had not won the F.A. cup so we realy want to move.
