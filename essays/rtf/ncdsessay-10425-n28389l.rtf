When I am 25 I will be an Vet. Tomorrow I am going to a stable to put a horse to sleep, then I will cut the horses leg open and find what is wrong with it. It is not a very easy job. I get about 30 pounds a week. I have got a wife who is interested in Biology. I have got two children they are called [male name], and [male name]. I am living in a Bungalow in [town]. At my surgery there is a nurse who helps me to heal the animals.  Words: 96
