I am married work as a nurse in a local hospital mostly day duty in my spare moments I sew or read a book. Cooking my own meals and my husbands, living in a house where we are very happy. There is a lot of housework to be done my husband helps me with my housework when he comes home from work. I am saving up to buy a house in the country where I can keep animals in my spare time and ride horses though I don't want to give up nursing. On an evening I make tea and wash up and settle down to read or more often clean* my pets out and play with them as well as feeding them or maybe I might go cycling with my husband. A lot of my time is spent on planning colours scemes ect for the house or when I am lazy cunjuring up the house of my dreams. I get up at 7. o'clock go to work coming home at about five o'clock getting the housework done and preparing tea I am finished about 7. o clock. And then atend to my animals and various pass times and watch television after wards. Having weekends off.  Words: 206
