I am twenty-five and I am a kennel-maid. I work from 9'oclock in the morning to 5'30 in the evening, this does not include Sundays. To get I go by bus.  At home I have two married sisters and one just getting I hope for she is twenty-nine and teaches. Some think as being a kennel-maid is a messy job, but it isn't really. The dogs are let out their kennel a 9'30 and after I have cleaned them out I prepare to brush, comb or bath the dogs if nescessary.   I would then take them for a walk and train them to obey me. After a while I would let them loose to do what they please. I would like to have a dog of my own though we already have on [one] at home I would get another one.   This is how I'd describe him. Little brown with a black patch of his eyes, one of them not two, blue or brown eyes I prefer brown on a dog and a very wagiful tale.  He would have a basket with a blanket in to lay on and a dish and bowl with his name in big blue letters. They would say and this is what I'd name him BONJO.  Words: 211
