When we go on holiday we usely go to Austria and Rent a house in the woods in the simmer. In the winter we go sking in Austria Sometimes in the weekends we go horse-riding. And we go swimming or scating if we can't go horse-hiding. I have a hair-dressing bisnuss which I bought. I do fulltime there. I don't have much time at home to do cleaning up. so I have a cleaning women in to do the tiding up. I have a Cook to do the cooking. My husband bought our house so we can paint it what colour we like and do things to it. My hair-dressing shop is right next to my house. The are thirty hair-dryers there and there are fourteen ladies there. My husband has a hair-dressing bisnuss for men. There are ten men working there because his is not so big. We are open every day of the week from 9 o'clock a.m. to 5.30 p.m. every day. When we go on holiday I take my mum and dad. My mum comes from Austria that is why we go nearly every year.  Words: 189
