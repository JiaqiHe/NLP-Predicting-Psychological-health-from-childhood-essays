I was 25 years old. I was grown up now and I was working. It was very hard life. I had to get up very early at half past five, and I did not finish untill 10 o'clock, at night. I had one break and that was at dinner time. That was only fifteen miniuts. I did not have much sleep at nights, or sometimes I didn't bother because I had to get up so early. My payment was not very much only enough to keep me living. I could not put up with it no more. I had to get a new job. I was trying and trying. For a few days I was waiting for one until at last I got one. I was very pleased. I did not have to get up so early and go to bed so late. I got payed well. It was like having a new life. I was happy as ever. I bought myself new cloths to work in, insted of my torn and tatty one. I bought some for going out to. I was able to have proper meals. I had no hard work. It was just easy. I had nothing to worry about. I was all back to normal again. I was happy. Everything was new.  Words: 216
