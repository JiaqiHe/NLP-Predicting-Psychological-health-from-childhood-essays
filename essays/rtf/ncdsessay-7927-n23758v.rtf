----------------------
I work as a nurse in [hospital] and I live as a boarder in the nurses home. I go riding in my spare time. I have two dogs a Collie and yorkshire terrier
      My mother often comes to see me and goes shopping in the town nearby. I shall always like the countryside because I like to feel free
      My friends work at offices as secretarys or other things. I often go to see them. I take my dogs out for a run on [beach] the seem to love it. The dogs seem to have half my pay.
      I hate going out and bying new dresses because there are so many to choose from Shoe seem just as bad. You can by a new dress quite dear and have it on about 2 weeks when the fashion has completely changed.
      In the hospital I enjoy life because everyone is so friendly. Sometimes we have the most fussiest patients but we cannot do anything more. 
      When my mother comes up she goes onto the kidney machine there I often come and talk to her. The night life in Newcastle is fabulous but I hardly ever go out. But its not a bad life to live.  Words: 205
