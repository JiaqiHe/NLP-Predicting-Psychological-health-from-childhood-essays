I am going out for another days work in an office, for the Insurance Company.
      I usually have a talk with the boys in the basement. I have dinner at half past twelve and have a cup of tea or coffee in the afternoon. My desk is crammed with papers and sorting them out is a job.
      In the weekend, I clean the car and do a bit of gardening. On Saturday and Sunday I go to the park or go for a drive in the country and take the dog for a walk. Soon Monday comes and I drive the car into the car park and a days work begins.  Words: 111
