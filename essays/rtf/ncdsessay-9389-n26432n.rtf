I get up about 8 o'clock. The I get ready foR work. I work in a libRary 9 o'clock till six o'clock. I get the [bus number] bus to [suburb]. When I am there there is all ways a lot of people waiting for the LibRary to open. In my spare time I like to go in to town and look at all the shops. But at night I like to see plays. Then when I get a day off I like to ride in my Small caR. I live in a flat. Its not very big but Its all right foR me. When I get about three weeks off I book up a holiday abroad some where about in Spain. My otheR interest is to go climbing up the mountians in Scotland. My pets are a small dog the breed is a Yorkshire terrieR. Now and then I go and see my parents I take my motheR some sweets and some flowers. I also like reading books. EveR Sunday I go to church at 12'oclock In my best dress with my best coat and hat. Then when Monday comes Its back to the library.  Words: 195
