I have now got a job as a photographa with the press. I play football for a club and I belong to a Sports club I do high jump long jump and any sort of atheletics. I have been to A***** 6 times and Ireland twice (on business). On Saturday night I go to judo classes so you can see I love sport. At home I have alot of pets there are 3 ratel snakes 2 king cobras and baby aligator. I love Reptilles and those sort of animals. My most importent job with the press was when I had to africa for three years and study the life on a snake farm. It was for pets corner in a newspaper. There were lots of hu***** were like giant egg shells turned upside down, in these **** were about six snakes, The idea was to take the Venom out so that people could have some in there blood. So when a snake hit them the venom wood not kill them, because the blood has had some poisen already.  Words: 178
