I am working at a riding-stable and when I am not cleaning tack, giving lessons to beginners or grooming, I am training some of the horses, mostly the young stallion. Also at weekends I take a group of more experianced riders out for a ride on the lanes and over some jumps. I am not married, but live on my-one in a small cottage by the stables. I own a few dogs, cats, guiney-pigs and a hutch of rabbits. In the mornings I get up very early and feed the dogs and cats, then I go out and feed the other animals. After this I go down to the stables and do the horses and get them ready for the riding lessons and the ride. Also I get the stallion ready for training. Then at about 9 o'clock my helpers come and we start the real work. Usually one or two of my dogs go out with me when I go riding.  Words: 162
