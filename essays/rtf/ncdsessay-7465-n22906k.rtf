"Now that I am twenty-five and have been through college to become a mathmetitian*. Through my work I have made enough money to own a car factory and several expensive cars as the Jaguar Mark 10, E Type Jaguar, Mercedes Benz SL250. I am a batchelor and that's what I'll stay. My interests are in philatelic auctions, as well as being manager of a stamp club for younger members of the public called ""philatelic services"". It is better for me not to drink or to smoke the doctor advises me. I live in a hotel in Montreal, Canada."  Words: 98
