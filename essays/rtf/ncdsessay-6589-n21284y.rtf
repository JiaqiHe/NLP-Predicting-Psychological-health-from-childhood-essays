Last Tuesday I celebrated my 25TH Birthday I WAS NOW full grown, tall 6 foot man, but I had something even better to celebrate for my young wife, who was twenty one years of age was expecting a baby.
      Although I am still in my mid-twenties I command a xxxx25,000 a year job as a manager of a string of 50,000 shops.
      I have quiet an easy job as I leave in my private Rolls Royce at about half past nine and I am driven to the [location] where my office is situated.
      The staff we have at present is a very lot for we have twenty people in it.
      Although I am at the office between ten and three the boss sometimes gets me TO do the pay packets for the workers.
      When work finishes for me I dont go home straight away for I usually have a game of cards or a round of golf with the boss.
      When I get home I watch a bit of television and go to bed *ready for the next morning.  Words: 179
