I am a footballer, aged twenty five I am married and have six children. We are the richest people in the road that we live in. I am getting on quite well in the football game. I also am a School teacher and we make a fair amount of money each week. We live in [city] and we like it alot. My wife has lived here ever Since She was born. I come from [town]. At first, when I came here, I found the acent very hard to understand. I first saw [city] when I was a boy of 13. My father had promised to take me to see [football club] play. I was a firm enthusiast of the game at the time. At  the school I teach , all my children go there. At night my supper is normally waiting for me on the table. After that I Send Some of the Children up to bed. I feel I am a little bit to soft with the kids. I usually can not get to Sleep at night and so I go pretty early to bed. This is to get to Sleep at the right time. At the weekends I usually have alot of time to Spare and most of it is spent playing with the kids, watching television, reading a book or having a snoze.
