I am now 25 years old . I am living in small flat in London. Every weekend I go for a ride with my friends . I work with them in an office, but it is not very interesting. I have two pets , a white kitten, and a canerey. I have only had them a few weeks.
If , when I come home from the office the weather is fine. i go and play tennis. I enjoy this sport very much. I hope , in about a years time I will be able to move into the country, or perhaps I might go and live by the sea. Then I would have a much better chance to look after my pets. I think then I will get a hamstar, and a golden labrador.
usuly I bye the food from a shop , eight miles from were I live.
Whenever it is wet on Saturdays I catch a bus and do my shopping in Manchester. I don't supose that I ever will live in the *contry. but it would wonderful if I could get away from London. even if it was for a few days.
I start work in the mourning at 8 o'clock,. then I have a lunch hour from 12.30 untill 1.30, I finish work at 5.30. Usually I do typing, but it gives me rather a headache. That is the main reason why I would love to live in the country. Also the traffic keeps me awake at night .  Words: 249
