Hello! Well here I am, 25 years old. My job of work is a fireman. I had to take a course for it. It was a tough course. I had to take exams too.I have only just been with the East London Fire Brigade two years. The biggest fire I have ever seen was the East London Electric Plant. It took five Brigades four hours to get the blaze under control. In the pratice calles the fastest time we have racked up is 45 seconds. We play football for a charity on Sundays. The last game we played we won 4-0. I scored one. The worst game we played was when we lost 15-0. My mum and dad live in [town] and I go and visit them at week-ends. The pay is not so bad. I don' t think I'll metion it. My Brigade won the trophy for the best kept station for the sixth time running this year. We hope to win it again next year. Then it will be an all time record! My favouite football team is Chelsa. I go to see them every Saturday I can. I go with my pals [male name] [surname] and [male name] [surname]. My room is full of Cheasa pictures. I live in [street name], I share it with [male name]. We're both in same Brigade. [male name] does the cooking he the best. I did it one Sunday and he spat it out. So did I. I told him he could do it from now on. Sometimes it go with [male name] to see his mum and dad in Battersa. Being in London we can go the Wembely  Words: 278
