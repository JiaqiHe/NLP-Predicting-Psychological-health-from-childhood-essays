When I am 25 I will probably be married and I will like to have a girl and a boy. I would like to be a nurse when I grow up. And if any of my chidren are ill I will be able to see to them. I would like to live in a bungalow. I would have to have home help if I was a nurse. In my spare time I would like a hobby. I do not know what my hobby would be. I would like my children to go to nursery.  Words: 94
