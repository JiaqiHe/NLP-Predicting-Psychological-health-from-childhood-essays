I would learn alot about teaching. I would also have to pass my exams to become a good eucated teacher. If I took chldren for games, I would teach the chidren all the instrucions for netball and rounders. If I had a class of my own, I would help the chidren in all their work, for instants. Arithmatic, English, Reading, etr.....If I didnot become a teacher I would like to be a Short-Hand-Trepest, or a secutary. I would like to do alot of reading, and writing. Also I would like to look after the school dinner money. And take a lot of phone calls. 
     For my home life and work, I would like to get married in white and have four children, 2 girls, and 2 boys. I would like to go to some dance, Halls, and also to the cinema with my husbound. I would not like to live in a flat, because my children would be able to have any pet to play with, to make them feel happy. I would live in a house, with flowers in the front garden and the back I would go out with my husband, and take our children to the parks and places to make them feel happy. My two grils when they are older, would have alot of firends. And they would be able to go out with boy at 15 or 16.  Words: 234
