"Introduction
I am 25 years old now I live in a house in the country I have still got my hobbies reading cycling walking and playing with animals

""Hello Mum"" said Jane as she burst into the back door ""Will you come down to the beach with us"" she said "" Sorry I can't I've got to go to work at the office they need me there"" I said ""I might come tommorrow if its fine. We got the day off. We'll have to go in the Afternoon I've got all the housework to do in the morning."" I said ""Okay"" said [name] ""I'll help with the beds and the washing up and dusting and anything else you want me to do."" Jane said in rather a fast voice. ""My house is such a mess"" I thought to myself ""I must get started early straight after breakfast.""
Next day I started my housework. I went up into the Attic to clean it out. There were so many little creatures up there I thought it would be better to clean the celler.
The celler was no better.
""Eeeek a mouse Oh no there are more. There's hundreds of them all over the floor."" I went to get the broom but when I came back they had all gone. (""They didn't like my face"") About half past eleven I finished work and went swimming"  Words: 227
