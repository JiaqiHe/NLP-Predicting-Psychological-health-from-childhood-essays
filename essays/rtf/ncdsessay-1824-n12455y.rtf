"I am a fully quallfied nurse and also a missoary. I have gone to Biafra and I am trying to bring medical acipment to help all the people. There are many horrid and terifieying dezeeses. I am trying to purswade my best friend to come and help me. I have just written to the Red Cross to ask if I can have more money, for the people are despretly short of food. To morrow (which is sunday) we have chaple. Over six thousand people come. Many people are not nerly so lucky as myself yesterday a child came to the chaple saying. ""Please restore my mummy and daddy from death"". They were dead the next day she is one of the victims of mulnutrishon. Every time I feel hard pressed by all the horrid things that are happening all around me, I take my violin out and play a gentle chune to my self. Tomorrow I am on my rounds. I have to go and treat people and again I see the pitful sites all around me. In my hospital there are no beds just twenty matrisas.  many people have to go before they are at all well. They go to make room for other people. One lady siad as she had to go ""it is not me I am crying about its my children I do not no what has become of them while I was away. Now my six months are over and am going back to see my family but I shcall come back soon."  Words: 258
