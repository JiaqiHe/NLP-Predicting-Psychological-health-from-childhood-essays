I am 25 years of age and my name is [firstname lastname]. I have just left University. I am now a pilote and my captain is [name] [lastname]. I fly the plane called 'The Flying Swan.' My captain says I'am a good pilote and he sometimes lets me fly it my self. It is a very interesting life and a pleasant one too. A plane is quite easy to handle because nearly evrything is automatic now. I have quite a lot of freinds all over the world and nearly all of them are pilotes like me. When your at the R.A.F. restraunt for your meals all you do is show your card and tell them your name, then you go to a table and it. You see you don't have to pay because it's out of your wages, where it much cheaper than in a public restrount the mony is good and you half a nice life.  Words: 157
