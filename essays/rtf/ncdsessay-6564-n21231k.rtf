When I get to the age of 25 I hope not to be married. I would like to get married when I am about 30, because I want to enjoy myself, if I got married at the age of 20 say I had 1 child I would not enjoy life. I would like to be like my youngest brother who is now 22 and he teaches swimming at swimming club. I feel as if I would like to be a swimmer all my life because at the moment I am swimming mad. That is my favourite hobbie. If I had any Spare time I would like to help my Mum and Dad and take them out in my car for rides out. If I got married at 25 I would not enjoy life because I think you are still young until you get to the age of 30.  Words: 148
