I would like first of of all to get a job as being a plumper. Being a plumper I would get about 20 pound a week. At the weekend I would go to a football match. On the sunday I would do some work if I had some spare time. When I get some holiday from work I would get a tent and all the rest of things would need. I would stay at the place where I was going to for about 2 weeks then I would come home. At the night time I would read the newspaper and at five past nine I would put the television and turn it to B.B.C. 2 and watch the Holiwood musickly and that would go on to about five to elevan and after that I would turn it back to B.B.C. 1 and go to bed.
