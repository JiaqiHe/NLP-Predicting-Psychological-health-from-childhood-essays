----------------------
I will be looking after my husbend and children if I have any. Doing the house work and making the dinner and all that. Doing the shopping and what I shall buy. If I have no children, then I will go out to work and it must be a good & sensible job. I will give some of my wages to my mother (that's if I'm not married.) The kind of job I would like, is to be a fashion designer, or hairdresser. I will give a good life to my family and never be unkind. but all ways be kind and happy. I will always be king and happy in my own home.  Words: 114
