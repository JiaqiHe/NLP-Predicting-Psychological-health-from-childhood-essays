It was twenty one when I was married and we had got two children and we had gone out to New Zealand to live because in Britain there was not enough country life in Britain. In New Zealand I worked on a farm. The name of my wife was karen and my two kids were called Paul and peter. I was twenty five now and I was 21 when I got married and 22 when I came out ot New Zealand. The thing that I like watch most was Rugby before when I was in Britain I used to like going to watch football but there wasnt any football in New Zealand so I couldnt go and watch it. The place that I used to live in before I went to New Zealand was Manchester and I used to go and see Manchester Utd play.  Words: 145
