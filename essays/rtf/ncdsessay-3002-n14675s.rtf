At the age of 25 I would like to a nurse in a childrens hospital. As I love to work with children like many people. My home life will be in a little flat with twins, my husband will be a quiet, good tempered, hard-working man. I will not be man crasy. But shall sit at home in the evenings and knit or sew in frount of a nice little wood fire I would not like to be a rich stuck-up women as I think all people shoul work for their money. My studies will be about children. I will look after my children very well and see that no harm comes to them, but all the same I would not spoil them, nor let any one else. They would go to bed at the proper times not stay-up to nearly midnight like most people let their children. They would not be goggel eyes and watch television for hours on end. But would see it for two hours a day. They would not go to private schools but mix* with nice children in proper Concil shools and they would do their homework every night and not skip school. If I had to stay at the hospital over night I would be quick sure my husband would look after the twins and not give them to much to eat. My hobbies would be knitting and sewing my the children, my husband and myself.
