I have now got a job I am manager of an engineering company my office in the middle of the works. Every night I come home my son called [male name] wants me to play with him. I got married when I was 21 and my son is 3 years old. Hegets his little football and we kick it around in the field. I watch television nearly every night till about 11 oclock and then I go to bed. In the morning I get up about 7 o'clock and have my breackfast when I have my breakfast I think about something that interests me that is going to see Leeds United play football. 14 years ago they won the 1st Division. My job at work is to see that the men are getting on with there work and seeing that everything is in order.  Words: 144
