If I was twenty five I would get a young girl to marry, I would have a house of my own and a family. I would take my wife out every saturday evening. I would still go to the speedway meetings for I am a keen [football club] supporter. I would try to be a speedway rider by then. but if I am not I would like to be an Electrician. My favourite rider is Norman Hunter. I would have a dog if I did have one I would have an alsation. I don't think I will go on to college. I would like to live in [town]. I would like to have an E. type Jaguar and if I have enough money I would have a boat. When my holidays come I would go to Spain or France. My wallpaper would be a light red. I would paint my house white.  Words: 152
