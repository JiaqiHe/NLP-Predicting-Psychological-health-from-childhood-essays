"I am a motor mechanic and I enjoy my work very much. I sometimes get the odd customer who is not pleased with the work I am doing and tries to get me the sack but I do not bother about it. On Saturdays I play football for the local team. I smoke cigarettes, but, find it hard to stop when I want to. I like playing with my three year-old son and taking him to the park. Myself and my wife and son live in a (place) flat on the top floor and we are saving up to by the new Ford ""Capri""."  Words: 104
