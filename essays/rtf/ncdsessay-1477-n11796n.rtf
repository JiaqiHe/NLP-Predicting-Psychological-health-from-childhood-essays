I left school at eighteen and started University I left University when I was 25 I had a faint Ideal of what I was going to do for a job I either wanted to be an aroplane hosstes, a matron on an educational cruiser or a Dentist assistant I could have done any of the jobs but I had to chose one. I went home and helped my pearents until we decided what job I was going to do I wanted really to be an matron on an educational cruiser my pearents were not very helpfull they always siad it's up to you. Some how it was settled that I was to be a matron, everything was ready and in two days time I was to go on my very first cruise the name of the ship was the Arca and she was going to Spain, Cyprus, North Africa and portugal. The two days went very slowly my things were packed and I was to go in a coach of 34 children I had my breakfast washed and dressed and caught the coach it was very noisy we were to get on Arca at southampton we had out lunch a Sailsbery and soon arrived at Southampton the Arca was a lovely ship, we went through customs and went up the gangplank aboard the Arca. I was shown the other matrons and I was shown around the ship when I was at home I had been given books about a matrons job so I was quite experimented I was given my uniform and was shown my first job of how to teach the children to put their life jackets on where their dormitarys and muster stations. As the days got to know the ship and people better, the matrons were even if they had spare time to go into countrys. The cruise was very sucsesful and I am going to stay as a matron.  Words: 323
