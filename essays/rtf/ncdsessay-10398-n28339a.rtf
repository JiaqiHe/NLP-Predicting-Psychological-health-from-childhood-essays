It is difficult to imagine that I am 25 but I will have a go. If I were 25 I would like to go abroad nearly every year. I would try to enjoy my life. I would like to get married and have children. I would like to work in a bank. As a hobbie I would like to draw sketchs of birds mostly and some other things. As another pastime I would like to take pitures, I would like to take pitures of my family. And I would like to become a student. I would like to have a car and I would take my car abroad to. And I would like to study things to like animals and insects like beetles ants spiders under a microso mbe. I would like to life in a house in the country or I would like to life in a bungalow near the sea. I would like to have one boy and one girl if I have children. I would like to play a instrument to I would like to play the trumpet or clarinet. Like I said I would like to work in a bank as a computer operaiter because one thing it brings in good money and another I would like to work with a perfic.t brain-wave.  Words: 217
