"I am now 25 and left school. My ambition is to set out and become and air hostess as I have always wanted to travel and see the world. I stand a good chance getting the job I applyed for because I have had a good grammer school education and therefore took languages. I had an aplication the other day I hurriedly filled it in and sent it of and the very next week a letter came through the door to say I got the job I started work and found it a bit hard at first but I soon got used to it. After a while I settled down and got married but this did not stop me from going to work. My husband had dark hair he is moderaly tall and has quite a bit of money. We own an E Type jaguar which is very luxurious. Very soon I started having pains in my abdomen so i went to the docters he said ""Mrs Clark you will soon be haveing a bady*."" Overjoyed at this news I rushed home and told John my husband but there was some sad news too it meant giving up work for a whole 9 months.
