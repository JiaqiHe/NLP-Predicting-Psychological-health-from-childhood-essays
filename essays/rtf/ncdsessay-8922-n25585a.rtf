The life I am leading is a good one. I hope to go to either University or Collige to learn more about the ways of animals. After I leave I would like to get a job at the R.S.P.CA or P.D.SA. I would then get some money enough I hope to start an animal home of my own. The sort of animals I would have are, donkeys, dogs, cats and goats. I have always loved animlas from quite an early age At home we have got a dog, a horse and two Abbysinian Guinea-pigs. I would like to film animals of any kind. And I think I would even emigrate to either Canada or Australia. If I cant get the job of a RSPCA helper I might be in a pet shop bit I wouldnt like that very much. I have got 29 weekly 3s 6d Purnells Encyclopedias of animal life.  Words: 151
