At home I enjoy watching television listening to the wireless, reading, kitting, sewing etc. I also like going to watch sports. Tennis, Football etc.
I would like to have children better than going to work as then I would have a lot of spare time to do things I would like to I only work as a secretary 3 days a week from 9-30-8-30. So that I have at least two days to do all of the house work and to go out to visit people and also to do some of my hobbies. I miss my husband quite a lot and also enjoy working. Most of my life isused up and I am hardly ever boarded. I don't go to the pictures very often because by the time I've finished work the pictures have already started.  Words: 246
