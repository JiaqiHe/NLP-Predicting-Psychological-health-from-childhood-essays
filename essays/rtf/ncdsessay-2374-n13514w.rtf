I might be an archeologist, I go abroad and dig in places which have shown some signs of buried life. At the moment I am working in the north of England, it is very exciting. Tomorrow I am going home. At home in London I go out a lot doing nothing in particular, except visiting museums. I will probably be married by then, so I will become a housewife, still interested in archeology though. I might go abroad, and live in America on a ranch, wihth my own horses. 
But really I don't know at all.  Words: 96
