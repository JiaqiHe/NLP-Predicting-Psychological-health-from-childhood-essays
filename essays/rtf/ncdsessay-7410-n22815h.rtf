F or the last four years I have been a fireman with (place). It is an intresting jo*, routine checks every day. One day the fire bell rang and everyone scrambled to the pole and jamp into their cloths and ran into the engine, when we got there the house was a blazing inferno . I ran out with the house , soon we had the blaze under control. I live a happy life at the station and at home. My work is not easy and not ha*d, checking equipment all day . like testing oxygen tank, climbing hoo* ladders and going places where crashes acurred and opening up cars doors and taking people out of the cars. Some people get killed because of careless driving and not wearing safety belts. The biggest fine was at a storehouse jute *ales were on fire. And in (place) the oil tanker was on fire it was delt with foam because water is lighter than oil so the water would flour on top. So the oil would just keep on burning. A firemans life is for people who are not sleepy heads only one thing thought a fire man never gets a good sleep because he is usually woken up by the alarm bell. The only sleep I get is when I am at home. A firemans life is for me .  Words: 229
