Sometimes I like going out and traveling and I think that going around to other places with the Army is good.  I would most like to go to Los Angeles in* America. I am very glad that I joined the army because you see the world and if I were picked to go to America, I would most rather go by plane because i have allways liked planes and they are faster. Joining the Army is a good thing but there are other jobs better than this and I think that I would love to be a pilot. When I am twenty five I will never get married. I have got lots of friends whom I like and I like some better than others. the place that I live in is quite good but there are other people here to and some of them I dont like. The work I do is fairly hard and makes you sweat but I still like it.  Words: 163
