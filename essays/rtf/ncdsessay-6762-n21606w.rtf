I would had done my a training at a tek. Five years of training were up 4 or 5 year up as a full cupinter. I mite of mairde and phearhaps a babby. I mite work for **** I don't know. In that time I mite or moved out of Sto*ford. Know I like making thing of wood. My uncle was in the trade and he took me round some of the sites. I like going round the sites. I mite put up a shed and a garage so I can put my car or van in it a garden tools in the shed. Really I would not like my wife to go out to work but do they house work and every year we would go on hoilday or if we did not I would do so gardning on get on with my work as a cupinter. Still if I was not a cupinter I woud be a brick layer I would like to somthing. Saturday afternoon I would like to play football for a anmeter team and summer when no football we could go swiming. In the summer it will be nice to work out side but in winter it would be cold. If you work in the shed making traners* in the summer it would be hot is side but in winter it would be nice not cold a if you was out side, Cupinter is a intesting trade. If my children wanted a swing I would make it. I would enar about xxxx20 a week you would have to make frames for windows doors, floors, cabnit, shelfs, stalls table and chairs. Sometimes I have to put fences up. Sometimes I mite go out pulling house down if I was a bricklayer.  Words: 295
