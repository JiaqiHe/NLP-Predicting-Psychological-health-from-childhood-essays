I have a job as a Secretary in a new building that has opened in town. My boss is Mr Macentosh. My hours of work are 9 o'clock until dinner time then go back at 1 o'clock and finish at half past 6. I go home and make my tea. After tea I tidy the house and wash up. Then I watch telivision for a few hours. Sometimes my friend comes to my house, she is 25 also. We go to dancing together and have a good time. On friday nights I visit my mother who lives in [town]. On a Saturdays I go to the pictures with my friends. When I read the paper I sometimes enter for compotisions. I once remember when I was a girl of 11 I won a place in the school hocky team which I enjoyed very much. A sport that I very much enjoyed when I was young was swimming and riding, but my parents could not aford riding lessons for me, so I just went with a friend of mine. Now I am not very intrested in sports.  Words: 186
