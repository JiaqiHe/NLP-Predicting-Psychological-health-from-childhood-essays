I would have my fathers camera and take photoghraphs for people at weddings I would allso go round houses taking photographs of peoples children if they wished. At the weddings I would not sell the pictures for the chronicle I would make money for myself. If this failed I would find something else but would not work in a factory.  Words: 60
