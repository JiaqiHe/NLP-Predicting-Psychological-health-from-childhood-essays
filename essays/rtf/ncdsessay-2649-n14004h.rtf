I am engineer and I work on a ship. I travel to different places and when I go back home I help my dad with his car. My uncle **** was working a a ship and I want to be like him. And he has told me about the a ship and it sounds very interesting. I will work in the engin room at the moment and it is had work and hot. If the ship is not going very well all the engineers have to work on it. And when I'm on l*ve I will do a spot of gardening. Then I go for a swim. Then when I go back on the ship I will do my best and do a lot of good hard work. And be a top engineer. At night I get some sleep and the other engineers who sleepet at day. Well go down in the engin room and keep the engin going. And in the morning I will go back down and keep working. I would like to be a ton* engineer and I would do my* best and all will be well. Then my mum and dad would be very prode of me. And when I have some mony* would take my mum and dad to australia and we would live there. But we will come back home and see my brother and sister. And I would tell there children what it is be like to be an engineer. And they might grow up to be an engineer. And collour* after me.  Words: 260
