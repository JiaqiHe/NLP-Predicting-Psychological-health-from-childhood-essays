"I opened my eyes. The sun was dazzling so dazzling that I shut my eyes for a moment. ""[name]!"" I heard a voice shout. It was my mother. ""Are you getting up yet?"" I replied, ""I'm coming."" I hurriedly dressed. Once downstairs my mother said, "" I suppose you'll be going out to get some peace and to get some ideas for your book."" I gobbled my breakfast doiwn and put my jacket on then went out. We live in a house in the country and this was very convenient as I was writing a book set in the country. The book was called ""Ramble with me."" It was about the things that can be seen in the country if you look for them. Out the corner of my eye I saw a sudden quick movement as a wild hare suddenly darted down a warren. I made a note of it. As I walked I noticed a uir wood. ""The very place,"" I thought. I ran there. I walked alongside a stream watching the speckled trout. Suddenly, there was a flash of blue and green, it was a kingfisher, it dived down at the stream and suddenly the stream was one trout the less. As I walked along something darted across in my path, it was a hedgehog when it sowx saw me it rolled itself up into a prickly ball and I remembered that only the badger could unairl it."
