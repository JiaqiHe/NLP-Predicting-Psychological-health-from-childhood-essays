I'm not sure what I'll do when I'm older but I would like to pass my excams. I think ill be looking after a few animals, at the moment I would like a Job with Somthing to do with animals. But when I'm older I may not want a job with animals I can not say excactly what I want to do. I think ill still be collecting coins and stamps. At the moment I do not want a car or a motor bike. I'd rather have a horse. I will Still go on holiday. I like to Stay in carvans so I think I would Stay in them for most of them. I would take my parents with me but if they did not want to come I would go with a friend or relation. I might go fishing some times because I do like it a little now I have the the rods and all the things I need. I will still read lots of books, I like adventure Storys best, also I like to read books on animals I have a penfriend that lives in Germany and I have a penfriend in New Zealand I hope to be writing to them for a long time. When I'm twenty five I hope to have a good Job by then. I would Still Visit relations often I will Still be at home with my parents I do not think that I will get married. I would meet with my friends very often. I don't really know where I'd go. I would still take part in sports I would play foot ball most.  Words: 273
