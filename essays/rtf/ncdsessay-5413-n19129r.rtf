Each day at 10 o'clock I arrive at my office because I am a typist, to taking Dictations and to typt important letters.
I have to come a long way to work, because I live in [town], and I work in London.
I am a very happy person but sometimes I get bored. I told you before I that lived in [town], has I am single I live in a flat just outside [town] with a friend called [female name] she is a very happy and gay girl and very friendly.
My interests are reading and parties I like to go to parties to meet different people and meet different people.
My other interests are hiking which I like very much and cycling and blowing and swimming. Each day my friend and I take turns to do to do the housework.
My home life is like this I get up at 7'am and I cook the breakfast and then get ready for work and then do so housework before I catch the train to where I work.  Words: 172
