I am a teacher at a junior school I have been teaching for four years. I teach at a junior school in [xxxxxxx]. I am married to a man who is a vet. I am due to have a baby this summer. I don't expect to be able to teach again till November. We have a nice house in [xxxxxxx]. We have an extension on the dining room and an extension on our garage. My husband and I have a car each. Mine is a bran new cortini. My husband doesn't get in until late so I have tea on my own. I live an easy life. My husband and I go swimming every Saturday. The thing that I am interested in most is Music. At the school I teach at everybody stays for dinner. I shall be very sorry if I have to leave school. I take the children in the 1st and 2nd years for music most of them are very good. On Saturday afternoon and during the holidays I work at Littlewoods. We usually go to Saundersfoot for our holidays. We go in the last two weeks of August. The headmaster at the school is very nice and so are most of the other teachers. I don't like Mrs Runsbottom much but I suppose she's alright.  Words: 219
