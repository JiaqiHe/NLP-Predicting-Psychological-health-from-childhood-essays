I am Twenty Five
I am married to an electrician and have got two children. Their names are [male name] and [female name]. I am a teacher at an Infants school and best of all I like teaching them how to write. I come home at half past four from school. The ages of my children are two and four. I have a nannie who comes from Jamaica and she looks after the children while my husband and I are out at work. When I come home from work I help nannie make the tea and sometimes I play with the children in the playroom. After tea I watch television for an hour. After this hour I get the children ready for bed. [female name] who is one goes to bed at six thirty and [male name] goes to bed at seven o'clock. My hobbies are running and all kinds of sport like that. One year I hope to compete in the olimpic games.  Words: 163
