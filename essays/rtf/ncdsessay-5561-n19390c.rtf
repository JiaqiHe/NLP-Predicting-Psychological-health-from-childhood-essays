At the age of 25 I would be training or have been trained to do a Job. I might have a family to feed and look after. I will be working for my living. I will get a Job that you will get well paid for. At home I will have a garden to look after. I would enjoy doing the garden. In my spare time I would enjoy a job not full time as a gardener and do other people's garden and cut the grass. I would be driving a car My job full time one might be a School teacher I would teach in a top year.
