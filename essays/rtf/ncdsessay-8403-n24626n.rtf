My name is [name] I live in a small flat in London in have an Aston Martin D.B.5. My job is flying an RAF Hunter and teaching other people to fly. I have recently bought an Auster monoplane to fly in my spare time. The last time I had some leave I spent it in New York with my pen friend over there. I enjoy fishing and swiming and reading. I am single and hope to stay that way. I passed 5 o levals and 5 a levals. I once had a go at stock car racing but I broke a leg and cracked too ribs in a pile up. I once had to parachute out over the pacific but I was picked up by a rescue boat.  Words: 128
