It was a Monday morning and I was just getting up to go to work. Suddenly I heard the Postman Coming up the path he posted about three or four letters into the door I hurried up to the door to colect the letters one was about my stamp colection and the others were just bills. I got myself dressed quickley and packed my lunch and went off to work I got to work as soon as i got in because i was late i worked very hard up to my lunch and i was looking forward to my sandwiches and drink. All i got for my pay was £16 2s 11d which was not very much to me Weeks and weeks pased by and at last i found myself a boy friend He was [illegible fiche] years older than me I was [illegible fiche - much] happier with a boy than by myself. I waited until i was twenty eight and I got married and i lived [illegible fiche - happily] ever after.  Words: 174
