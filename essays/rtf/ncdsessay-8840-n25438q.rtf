----------------------
I very much enjoy my work. I have always liked animals (dogs mostly) and being a kennel maid I am near to animals. I hope eventurly that I will have a kennels of my own. I have a very nice house near the country, but it is not to far from the town. Often I take my two dogs for a walk (they are Labradors) through the woods. I am not married as I like to travel. My other hobby is music. (I play a gutair) Most of my friends are intrested in animals and we are all members of the R.S.P.C.A. I like to have a months holiday evry year but I do not always get it. If I do get a month I go abroad and travel around Germany Switzerland and somtimes Italy. This year I hope to go to somwhere else, Greece or Rome. At times like this I would like to take my dogs but there is six months quarentine, so I put them in my employers kennels where they get well treated. Being a dog owner I know what it is like to leave them while you go away. That is why I want to own a good kennels so people will not be worried about thier pets. Also I am very intrested in history and archiolgy. I have got some old pices of my own.  Words: 231
