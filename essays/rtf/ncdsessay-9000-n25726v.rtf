I am a twenty five year old house wife with a 1 year old child. I have stoped work and I am looking after my child. I somtimes leave her with my mother while I go shopping. I dont beleive in going out at night and leaving my child in bed or with anybody. I dont mind leaving her with my mother. My husband comes home at all different time. He never goes out without me, he doesnt go with the lads and I dont go out with my friends. He does not smoke and he does not drink. He can drive a car. I only smack my child for being naughty and not for pulling the ironing down, I would if she was four or onwards but I woudnt at the age she is now. I have new clothes when I need them and not every week like some mothers, I will not spoil her and I will not let her be very cheeky. I will probably have another baby later on. I love her and I would not give her away or harm her. I keep everything clean, my child my husband and I. Propobly when she starts school I will go back to work, I dont leave it all to my husband. I will not tell her everything to soon, she will no at a proper age. I can drive to, and my little girl will drive. We live on our own just my child my husband and I.  Words: 252
