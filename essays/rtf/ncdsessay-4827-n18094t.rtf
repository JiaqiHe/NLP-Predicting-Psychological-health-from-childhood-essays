"I am a professional actress like Julie Andrews. I play tennis a lot and often go to the swimming baths, ice rink and I go trekking on Sunday afternoons. I am not married yet. I am making a film called Romeo and Juliet and I am playing Juliet. Romeo is my boyfriend and we often go out together. His name is [male name] [surname] and he is small, fair and handsome. He wears glasses but he has a very quick temper if he sees me going out on a date with my other boyfriend [male name] [surname]. My real name is still [female name] [surname] but I have a stage name, ""JIJI"".
When I am at home I either read or reherse my parts. I am being paid xxxx50 a week. Very soon I am going a tour round the world where I will be putting on shows in Paris, Spain, Australia, Yugoslavia, America (where I will meet Noele Harrison, Rex Harrison's son), London, Holland, Scandinavia, Scotland, Ireland and Wales."
