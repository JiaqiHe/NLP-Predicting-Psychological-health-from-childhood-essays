----------------------
I'd like to get a job as a road worker or a farmer. I'd like to work about 12 hours a day, getting about xxxx5 a week - not too easy a job and not too hard a job. 6' oclock in the morning to about 10 oclock at night I'd like to have a lot of friends - I'd like to drive a lorry or a dumper.
1 1/2 days off a week to repair the lorry if any thing happened to it. Stop in bed for a day - work on the lorry for 1/2 day.
I'll be living with my mam and my aunt - I'll be able to stay in by my self. Start work at 19 - I would have a paper round until then .
A little house in the country some where near (town) . I'd like a little car of my own - maybe a motor bike first.
Visit my mother at the weekends.  Words: 158
