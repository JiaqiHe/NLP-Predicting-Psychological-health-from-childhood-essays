My ambition would be to be a profeshinal footballer, but if I was not good enuf to be a footballer I Would like* an office Job in a big city or town. I would rather not get married* and I would like to live by my self. If I could be a proffeshinal footballer I would like to Play for my local club [football club]. When I am 25 I Would like to go abroad to Europe a lot and north america. If I was welthy enough the car I would like to get Would be*** an (e) type Jaguar.
