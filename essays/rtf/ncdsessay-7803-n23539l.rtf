I think when I am 25 years old I would like to be a teacher and be it for sewing and knitting I don't think I will get married because I think I will have a better life . I would like to go to Canada because I would like to see the scenery . If I did go to Canada when i would have saw the scenery I would come back and stay with my mummy . for a little while then go some ware like another different country . I would not like to spoil my life just keep it just when I was eleven . If I did go to another country I think I would go to Germany . I would go to clubs and have a good time and would not drink or smoke . if I did get married I would keep my place tidy and I would like to stay in (place) some ware . I would go out to work and When i got older I would still work . I would knit and I would do other things in my spare time if I came home early from work I would not like to get married but if I did I would not like my husband to go to football matches.
