After six or seven years at grammar school and roughly seven years at Veterinary College, I am a qualified vet. It depends how long I take at these various schools exactly how old I will be. I am now twenty five and a qualified vet. I have bought a bungalow and made it into a surgery apart from the house which I share with my parents. I am planning to get married next year, at twenty six. I live in [town] where animals are very common. If, when I have no work to do I shall work in a small shop. If I get a good amount of Money in a week, month or year I would not keep it for my own, but give it so some charity  Words: 129
