My job is a vet. My favourate animal is a horse. It always has been and always will be. I enjoy life very much although I am not married. As I am a vet and know how to treat animals I thought I would make an animal compound so I could buy tortoises dogs rabbits cats monkeys and as I have a field buy one or two horses, and if any of them are ill I shall have plenty of practice making them better. Some people bring aninals who are down in the weather or to be infected against distemper but the worst thing is putting animals to sleep, but of course it does not hurt them, they are just put into a box where they go to sleep and never wake up again. I had set my heart on this job when I was only 10 years of age. As well as looking after animals I go to a gymnasiun. I would have liked to do sculptior but I soon found out that job wasn't for me, I would also have liked to do potery but that was the same as sculptio*. When I was 11 years of age I liked football and tennis. I liked swiming but could not go much because I very easily got earache.  Words: 219
