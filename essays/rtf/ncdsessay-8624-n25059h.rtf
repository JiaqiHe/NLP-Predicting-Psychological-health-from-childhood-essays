I have a good job with good pay. My wife has had a baby and we call it Michael. I am a teacher. Before I am 25 I would like to travel through Africa studying the wild-life. And photographing them. On the weekends I would do some gardening. If I had enough time. I would like to get a piece of land and take up gardening as a hobby. If I had passed my driving test and got a car I would be able to visit different places in the world. I would espicially like to go too Africa visiting the game reserves. I would take a camera and photograph its animals.  Words: 112
