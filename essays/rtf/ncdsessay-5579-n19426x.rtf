"My Name is Detective inspector [name], I am 25 and I work for York police. I live in a house in the country and my hobby is golf  Yesterday I was down at the police station at my usual office desk working on a crime when the telephone rang. It wanted to say that there had been an accident and they wanted my assitance at the scene. It was evening when I arrived home and I had time for a game of golf before it got too dark. I played very well on the first eight holes but on the ninth I began to tire. I decided to go through to the eighteenth and then go home. It was 10 'o' clock when I arrived home bed time so after a bath I want straight to bed In the morning it was brilliant sunshine so after my breakfast I collected my fishing tackle and went for a days fishing in the river [river] which is about eight miles from my home Next day I was back at the office working on the last clue of the crime when suddenly P.C.[name] came in and said ""We've got them sir the car thieves"". I grabbed my hat and coat and went straight to my car waiting outside the station which took me straight to the place where they were caught. In the evening I sat by the fire reading a book when a knock at the door came. It was P.C. [name] again to say the thieves had been trialled and found guilty and sentenced for 10 years a bit harsh I thought but never the less they derserved it."  Words: 278
