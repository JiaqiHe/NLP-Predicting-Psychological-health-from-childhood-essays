I would probably be married and leading the life a housewife does, cleaning the house, washing up. I wouldn't only do this, I would still be playing the panio, getting better to being a professional. My other interests might still be stamp collecting if I had a good collection. but I might have taken up gymnastics. but I doubt it, although I like it very much. Swimming perhaps, or diving might be included. My work could be in an office part time until I found something better that suited me. I would still be at home working in the house. I might even have work to do at home. It Might be dressmaking. My home life would be harder and more lively if I have a child. It would mean more washing & tidying up. So my life at 25 would be very busy what with house work, hobbies and office work then children. Children would also mean buying more clothes and even knitting. some.  Words: 165
