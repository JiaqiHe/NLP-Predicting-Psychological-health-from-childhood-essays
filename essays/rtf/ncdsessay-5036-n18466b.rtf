My home has not all the things I want. I wish I had a lot of nice things to wear. When I get to twenty six I going to go and get work as a Dentish then after about two years after I have a other try about getting things for the home I live in. Before I go and try as a Dentish I have about too children. After about four years at Dentish I go and be a normal housewive and get work at a factory and try and get a lot of those things I wanted. On Sundays we will go to church and go home and into bed. The living room will* have two chairs and a table a sideboard and four chairs for the table.  Words: 130
