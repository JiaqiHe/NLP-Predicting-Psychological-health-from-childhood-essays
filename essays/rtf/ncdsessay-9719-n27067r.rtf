I have a wife and three children I work at the steel-works. My chidren are 4, 5, 3. I like driving places and walking in the countryside. We have a nice house with a kichen dining room and a hall with a seperat toilet and bath 3 bedrooms. 3 single beds a 1 double bed. I also like taking the children to places like [town]. And I would especaily like to take the children to [town]. They like play football and racing. Now and again I take them to a place where we can have a game of football sometimes take them to parks. At the steel-works I get about 15 pound pay money. I get back and for to work by the car I have a austin mini. It is a good car. The petrol costs 5s ,, 6d a gallon. I take the kids for rides to places. The most thing is when we go to town we all go in the car and we spend quite a bit of money the children buy a few things and a bar of chocolate or something else then we go home and the kids get* changed and go out to play.
