I am now 25, I have a very interesting job I am a nurse at the City hospital, although sometimes I find it difficult work. In my spare time I go horse riding, at the stables near our house. At home I cook and wash for my husband, we have been married 5 years now. We also have two children a girl 2 months and a boy 4 months. My main intrest is to be a matron at our hospital, I have always longed for that since I was a child. Sometimes on a Saturday I help at the hair-dressers in town near our village, but since we have had our children I have not been able to make it much. Nearly every Saturday [name] (my husband) and I go out for meal some where, we get a baby sitter for the children. It is always a good night out, I always look forward to it. Another of my intrests is typing, I go to a typing class every week. I think I lead a hard and interesting life.  Words: 179
