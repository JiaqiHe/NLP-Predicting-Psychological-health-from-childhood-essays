----------------------
I am twenty five years old and I am leading a good life . I work at a Primary school as a teacher in (place) . I have been one for four year now as I came out of university at the age of twenty one.
My interests are painting potraits and playing the guitar . I have been playing since I was 11 year old and I went to lessons in school. I spend most of my time painting potraits of famous people.
I hope soon I will get a job in the secondary school but I suppose I will have to get more highers before I could apply for the job. I have a good home life living with my mother , father * sisters. I don't go out often at night's but I go out in the day-time.
My work is not hard at all but it is the older children I take. If I did get a job at the secondary school I would take Maths . I hope to be a teacher until I become 40.
I have a sister at 27 and a younger one at 15 who is still at school. She also hopes she can stay on to .  Words: 203
