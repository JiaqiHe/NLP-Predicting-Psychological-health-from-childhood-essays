I am twenty five years old and I am a teacher, I work in an infant school because I like younger children. I enjoy most of all teaching them to read and to write and I like joining in with their games. At home I will try to join clubs that my friends are in and try to fit in with everyone else. Aslo at school I will try to make all of the children happy by keeping them occupied. If I think the children have tried hard to spell and read, I will proberbly give them a treat like a singing lesson or drawing or painting. In my spare time I try to think up things that we will do at school the next day and I will try to think up things that will turn lessons into games and make them more enjoyable. If I still have spare time I will go for walks and look for things that will be very interesting to look at. In the school holidays I will try to see some of the countrys in the world with one of my friend (if they will come with me). When I am on holiday i will get to know the people and find out about the way they live and if they enjoy living like that. For the rest of the holidays I will do a bit garding and try to arrange patterns with flowers that are brightly coloured. At night time I will do a bit dress-making I hope to be able to make all of my own clothes.  Words: 266
