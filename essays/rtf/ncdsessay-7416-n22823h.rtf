At the present age of twenty five I am not yet married. I have applied for a few jobs but I have been turned down. The last job I applied for I have not yet had a reply from. The job was as a goalkeeper but I don't know yet if I will get the job. At first I was interested in farming but I could not find a farm to my satisfaction. I live in a flat in [city]. The flat is near the shoping center which is a very big place. The room in which I live is very comfortable and it has a lot of room. I have many friends in the flat and a few from outside. The life I am leading is a very enjoyable one and I going for walks in the parks on Sundays. I also goes* for a drive down to the football pitch on saturdays to watch the football. I have often been to the swiming baths on Friday evenings. The cinema is a large one which* I have been to once or twice. When I am in the flat with nothing to do I often goes to play bingo at the club. I do not have many visitors so I have to visit them.  Words: 214
