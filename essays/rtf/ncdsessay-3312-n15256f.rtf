My name is (name) and I am a Zoo Keeper at the (place) Zoo. At the moment my department is the lions. I got a job at the Zoo, not because of the wages but because I like working with animals. I live alone in a flat in the centre of (place) . While I am not at the Zoo I fly model aircraft. I belong to a model aircraft club which meets every Saturday at an old (place). We fly the aircraft in the large grounds of the house. I also belong to the (place) which meets at the same place every Sunday . Although I spend a lot of time working I manage to visit these clubs regularly. I have to do my own cooking at my flat as I do not have a house-keeper, but I am quite good at cooking so I get on alright .  Words: 150
