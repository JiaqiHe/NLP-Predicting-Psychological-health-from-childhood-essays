My name is [name] Iam 25 years old My parents died last year in a car crash and I now live on my own in flat. Sometimes I watch the television and get guests in the middle of an exciting television programme I work in a spark plug factory and make spark plugs. When I started this job I went to a building where we had to put pins into a pin cousion. This was to make my speed quicker at welding pins This went on for weeks untill I could put 100 pin in the cousion (in under one minuite) then I went on to the next stage we had to weld three pins and put them into a glass container soon this stage was finished and I went to a huge hall where I began my work. I own an allotment in the country I use it to grow my provisions for the winter. My hobbies are sking swimming boating and first aid. Near the sea I own a luxurious house and a boat and a car. I am hoping to get married soon so that I can have a family and have a wife to cook my dinner because I am not very good at cooking.  Words: 209
