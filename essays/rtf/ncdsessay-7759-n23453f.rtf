I am 25 years old, my job is making sign's. I have got a wife and two children. Each morning I get up a eight o'clock and have my breakfast. When I had my breakfast I go to work. I work at [street name] road and [street name] road. My dad taught me what to do. He tell's me how to look alfter the merchine's and how to you's them. I like making Huntsman sigh's. When it is half past one o'clock I go home and have my dinner. When I had my dinner I go out and see people who want some sign's. At five o'clock I come home and have my tea. When the children come home from school I go and play with them. (They come home about quarter past five because we live so far from schol.)
After that I go home and put the children to bed and the whatch television. About eight o'clock I go to the Consirvitive Club for a drink. Then I come home and go to bed.  Words: 175
