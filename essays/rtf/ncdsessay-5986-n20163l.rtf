I am 25 years old and I am a teacher. I want to teach Arithmetic. I might want to be a swimming instructor too because you could learn people how to dive, float and swim, I am married and have two children. At home I help my mother to do her work. I help her as much as I can. My children's names are [female name] and [male name]. [female name] is five and [male name] is four. They are very good swimmers. I will be teaching An[female name]ne this year and John next year. I have 38 pupils in my class and they are all good workers. I teach swimming on Saturday's at the [town] baths. At the baths I teach 21 girls and 19 of them know how to swim already. My husband also teaches swimming and he had got 30 boys left out of 39. This year we are going to go to Canada to see my father, and next year we are going to see my husbands mother.  Words: 172
