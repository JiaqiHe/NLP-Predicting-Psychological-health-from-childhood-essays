I am now a teacher at a junior school it is not an easy job but I like it I am intrested in photography and have a large collection of photographs both of my family and of historic occasions. 
      My life goes in the same routine every day here is that dialy routine: 6am get out of bed cook my breakfast 7am wake up children and wife 7.15am collect and read newspaper. 7.30 collect car from garage. 8.0am start of to school dropping son of at approx. 8.30, 9.0 arrive at school. 12.0 noon break for lunch 1.15 school starts again, 4.0pm start out from school 4.30 collect child from school 5.0 arrive home. 6.0 have tea mark work from school 7.30 go to photography practise (Tuesday and Fridays). My main subject at school is ART I am not a bad artist myself I am a also intrested in history and often when the history teacher is away I take his place. 
      I have an ambition to become a headmaster for although I am already deputy head I find this not a very responsible job.
      My wife does not work and I have a son and a daughter my son has only just started school and is five years old and my daughter is three years old.  Words: 219
