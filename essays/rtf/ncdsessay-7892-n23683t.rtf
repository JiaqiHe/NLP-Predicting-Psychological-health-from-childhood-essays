I hoped to be a teacher of P.T. and when I am too old I would be a teacher in a school, something like an English teacher. I have managed that and now I am going to get married, I will have about two children. I will have to live in my own house with my parents and sisters until I can get a house of my own for my husband and children. I will be going to mothercraft if there is one near enough. I will go to dances with my husband and get a babysitter for my children. I would go shopping to buy clothes and food for my family. On fine Saturdays I would take the family to my parents and relations for a visit. (When my children start school I will apply for a job as a P.T. teacher and when they are grown up and can look after their selves I will apply for an English teacher) but I am 25 years old now and I have got a husband but I have no children.
