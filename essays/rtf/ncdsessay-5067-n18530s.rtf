I am now married but am still teaching geography, history and English. I have joined a cookery club and do a great deal of cooking at home. Although I go to work I still find time to be captain of a Guide company and go on hikes, camp and other outings with them. I have one child, and the three of us go to the cinema every other saturday. I attend church reguarily and sing in the choir.
      Often I go visiting people, old people, friends I used to now at school or relatives. I have been to Australia and am hoping to go Switzerland , Austria, and Greece this winter. I enjoy going shoping in the little village where we live in a detached residence.
      My husband is a surgeon and is an important doctor in a large hospital. Though I do a great deal of work I have time to rest in the evening and lead an exiting and enjoyable life.  Words: 163
