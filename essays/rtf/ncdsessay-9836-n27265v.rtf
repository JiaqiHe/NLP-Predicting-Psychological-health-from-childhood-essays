My work is car desigening. I has only just started and I am only an assistant. One day I hope to design my own car and name it with my surname. Every day I go to work at half past eight till 5 o' clock in the evening. Every Wednesday, Monday and Saturday night I play tennis. In the season I play hockey as I am the captin of [county] hockey club I also am going to drive in car rallys. When I get a bit older I hope to design racing cars. I like gardening and I do a bit every time I have a chance. At the moment I am busy polishing an old cooper maserati Formula 1 from 1969 around the time when the airofoil was invented as I have a large workshop to do it in I used to be a Queen Scout but I had so many other occupations that I had to give it up.
