Well if I would work at the hair dressers and at home I would look after my mum. At night times I would go to the pictures with my freinds. if I have any children I would want them to be a girl and a boy and I would call the boy crand and the girl sharrn. and I would go out a lot and buy my mother things for the house I would my my mother clothers and my job well as I said I might be hair dressers or if I could not be a hair dresser I could work at the printworks and then I would e*an a lot of money I would have a boy freind and I could get married then it would been a new life for my children if I have any. If I have two girls or two boys it will be just to bad but I'd still have 2 children won't I that all about me. and my mother and I would have two look after my little brother if my mother was ill.
