I am a lecturer in a university and enjoy my work because I enjoy speaking and also like making up my own speeches. I live in a fairly quiet town and during my holidays I live in a small cottage in the country which is near a farm and where I can go horse-riding. When I have time I read  and if I can, go to the beach and swim. I like playing tennis and going to visit ancient remains and museums all over the country. My home is a fairly small house in the centre of the town which has a lawn and flowerbeds at the back and a rockery and lawn at the front. Near my home there are various facilities such as swimming baths, library and a large park which contains tennis courts, putting greens, flower beds and trees and a large piece of grass for children to play on and swings for them also with a park keeper patrolling the park to make sure everything's all right.
