I am now 25 and I am a teacher at my old school. I live in a private house in the country. I leave my house at 7.30 to reach the school at 8 35. I am not married and I live with my puppy and my pony. In the garden there is a stable for my pony and a little kennel for my puppy. At school I am a games teacher. My classroom is my old room when I was at school. All my pupils are fourth year. The school is top of the hockey league and the netball league. My puppy whose name is Patch is the school mascot. My pony called Puzle is a piebald pony and has won twelve jumping cups. 
I am very happy at school, some times the children are naughty but most of the time they are well behaved. I have fourty children in my class, twenty-one girls and nineteen boys. I hope to marry soon and have some children of my own.  Words: 170
