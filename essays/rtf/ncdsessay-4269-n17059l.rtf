The work and life I am leading is just right. I am now working at [company] as a pipefitter. They have put me in charge of my job for a week or two then someone else will take over. The time is 10 p.m and its time for me to go home. I do what you call work shifts and this week I am on two till ten. I get on my scooter and say goodbye to the rest of the lads and go on my way. I take the same route home as I always do and end up in our same street. I ride up the drive a put my bike away in the garage and go in to say hello and take my working clothes off and change into my overalls and go back in the garage to do some woodwork. I am building a scale model of the work. I have just reached doing the main furnace and workrooms. Now Iam doing the main shed where the iron is kept. The furnace is over 90 feet high and 10 feet in diameter. Then my mother calls me in and asks if I want something to eat. She says that its time to come in and she gives me a hot cup of coffe and I bring my model inside and take my model upstairs.  Words: 228
