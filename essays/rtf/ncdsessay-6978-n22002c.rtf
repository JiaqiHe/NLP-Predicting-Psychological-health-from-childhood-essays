When I am 25 I will be driving a car. my interests are riding horses. I am lerning to be a air hostess at the moment. but in my spear time I like to go out to dances and other entertainments but now adays when I am training to be an air hostess I dont really have much spear time for things like that. I am learning other langwidjes at the moment I am finding them very dificult aspecarly French. when I go home after spending a time away. I am always so tierd and usly go to bed. but I dont spend very long at home because I have to go back again. I go away for about 8 weeks at a time and spent about 10 days at home.  Words: 131
