Working as a model.
I work in a very big dress store. I am a model and when we sashion shows I have to model some of the clothes. I model beach wear as well as ordenary dresses and evening dresses. We sell shoes and coats as well as dresses, beach wear, and evening dresses. At the end of the week we get payed. I get xxxx30 a week and that does notinclud what I get for modeling and for fashion shows. I get xxxx10 for modeling and I get xxxx17 for fashion shows. On a saturday night we have more than 6 fashion shows on saturday night and then we go out for a drink. We have to work on sunday as well as the days of the week. The day I like best is monday. Tuesday is the worst day of all becase. we get new stock and you are on your feet all the time. The only time. you have a sit down is at dinner time. I enjoy the work I do very much in deed. The people at work are very kind.  Words: 186
