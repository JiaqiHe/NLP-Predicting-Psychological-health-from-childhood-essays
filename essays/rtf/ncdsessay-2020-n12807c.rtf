After we are airbourne I tell everone to undue safety belts and I ask for If anyone would like refreshments Some of the chldren do not like planes so I give them sticks of barley suger to keep them happy. I have a number of foreign ladeis and genlemen on the plane so I have to learn foreign languages.
