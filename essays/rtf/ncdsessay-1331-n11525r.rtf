I am now twenty five and I work as an Electrition in Exeter. I rent a flat in Exeter so that I do not have to travel very far to get to my Job I leave my flat at about 20 past eight am. to get there becase it only takes about five minutes to get there in my car. it is quite an interesting Job and I enjoy it My Job is to go out in one of the finns* vans to do any job which may crop up. I usually get back in time for a ealy tea but not always. On sundays I usualy clean my car which is an opol Diplomat or sometimes I visit my family, For my holiday I usualy go to Scotland I take my gun with me so that I may be able to get a bit of shooting in but I go mostly for the nest becase it is so peastal there up in the Hills and sometimes I manage to get a bit of fishing done and when I go home again it is so dull, going to work sitting at home at night watching television but I soon get used to it when I forget about my holiday in Scotland.
