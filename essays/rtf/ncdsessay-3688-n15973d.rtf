My age is twenty five and I live at [address]. I enjoy my work at the Raophane as a short hand typist in an ofice. At home I like to keep animals at the moment I have a mouse a cat and a budgie. At home in my spare time I like to do some art an dthings lik ethat, I very much enjoy doing paintings and sketchings. Also in my spare time I read and tidy things like my room. At work my job as a short hand typist is very hot for I work in a small ofice with another girl of my age. About two o clock it gets very stuffy and hot and if we open a window it gets to cold. At night sometimes I go to the dancies and other times I just stay at home. On wedensday it is my half day and I usely go to [town] to have a look round. At home in my bedroom I keep many paintings that I have done myself I also keep all my easels and paints there and my mother gets sick of them at times.

Also I have a sister at the age of 28 which is married and a little baby girl so now I am a Aunty which I enjoy very much I take the baby for walks sometimes. I enjoy my life very much.  Words: 254
