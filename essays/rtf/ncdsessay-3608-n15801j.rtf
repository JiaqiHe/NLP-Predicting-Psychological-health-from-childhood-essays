When I am 25 I hope to be a qualified nurse and to be working in the hospital on the Maternity ward. On my days off I hope to visit my parents. The reason I want to work on the maternity ward is because I like badys. I also hope to become a sister on the maternity. During my Spare time I might Write books. When I have my holiday for about two weeks I hope to go to Canada or Austria. If I can't be a nurse on the maternity Ward I would be a midwife. I might get married I don't know I would much rather be a nurse than any thing else. If I do get married after awhile and have a family I might go back and be a part time nurse or something the nursing line, when they are older. If I have any children I will four at the most. I don't think I will have three children because they tend to Squable or one gets left out. At home in the evening's when the children have gone to bed I will sit and read or knit. The books I would write would be about nursing, boarderig School or family books for Children. If I wrote any books for adults it would be about nursing. I think nursing would be the only career I would enjoy. As a nurse you can make friends with patients cheer the children up who miss their parents and comfort others who are going to have an operation.  Words: 259
