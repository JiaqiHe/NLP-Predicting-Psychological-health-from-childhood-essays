My work is a post man and I get up at 6 o'clock every morning and do not finish until 7 o clock. I think that I shall change my job for something earlier. My hobbies are bird watching at the weekend I go in the country to bird spot my other hobby is train spotting. 
The life I am leading now is a pretty hard one but I suppose it will get easier as time passes on. 
Another intrest of mine is painting and decorating. At my house it is pretty upside down and its hard to get anying done at the time I come home. Another hobby I like is ASTRONOMY which means look at the stars.  Words: 119
