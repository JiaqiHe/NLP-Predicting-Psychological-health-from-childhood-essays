I am an footballer. In my spare time a run two sport shops. I am the handy man at home. The shops that I run are doing very well. I live in Leicester and the city are doing very well in Division one at 5 place in the table. I useully get about 6 hours a day to do the jobs that I am expected to do at home. I run as well as the two sports shops a numbers which my father has handed it over to me I get xxxx100 each wekk xxxx75 on football and xxxx25 on each of my other biso*. inesses. Half of my money goes in the bank and the other half goes towards house keepping. I am interested in clothes so I have decided to start a Fashion shop in a few weeks time.
At the moment my wife in in hospital having a baby, we have allready got a boy, he is 2 years old. I realy hope it is a boy, so that they'd get on better together. I don't mind if it is a girl but girls are a bit funsy about things. 
At the moment I have to get my own food which in troblesom because I can't cook!
If I could go on holiday I would either go to France or Australia. Those two places because they have lots of things to see, and they are warm countries too. 
When I finish my footballing carear I hope I have a lot of shops all over the place so I have a good pro* prouse bissiness I hope to end my footballing career at 35.  Words: 274
