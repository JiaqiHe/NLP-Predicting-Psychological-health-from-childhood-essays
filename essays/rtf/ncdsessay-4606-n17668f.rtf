When I am 25 Years old I hope to have my own chemist. I will not have a wife so I can spend my money on better things. If I have saved a good deal of money I shall by a house for my pearents. and then I shall live with them. I will by animals and in my spare time look after sick animals. and iventing cuerse. for them I will have my own plane and a good car and mabe a cabin cruser. I will gi*ve a good deal of money to the R.S.P.C.A. and to charerty. I will be good freinds with my brothers* and sisters and I hope to have family meatings. I will be happy and contented if I have some of these things.  Words: 129
