When I am 25 I would like to be a sailor and go to sea and see all the diferent lands I would like to live just the way I do live, and In the same house . I would like it if I could play football as well and save for a car and bring up a nice family like my own my interests are to swim and save coins from all over the world , to go camping , learn to drive. My work would come first, in the Navy i would like to be on a battle ship just like my father on the ship I would like to be the gunner and just to remain as a private sailor and just be like every one else in the world. That will be my carrier when I grow up I would like to have some good and ho***t fr***ds to visit all over the world.  Words: 158
