I have quite a big house in the country. I work in a office at [village] In the morning I have't to do the work before i go to the office I get up at 10 to 6 in the morning When I come home from the office I have't to feed the pony, the cow's and the sheep, and then I get my tea and watch television. I am a typist at the office and it is quite hard to typ because you keep going wrong and then you have't to start all over again. I enjoy watching showjumping on the television and I like foot ball as well I have one pony and seven cow's and 25 sheep to look after The pony is called Puff he is 14hh and I let children ride him when ever they like becaus they sometimes help me with the work at the week-end On Sunday I go to church and in the afternoon I go to the market and on Saturday I do the washing and ironing so i am all ways busy and Saturday night I milk the cows and feed the baby lambs I have three lamb's and two calf's At the office you meet load's of friend's they are all nice people to meet and kind.
