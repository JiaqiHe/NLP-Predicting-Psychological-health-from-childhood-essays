When I leave scool I would like to be a hairdresser or a nurse I would like to be a hairdresser because if I went to partys and club dances I would be able to do my own hair but if I cecome a nurse I be able to help people and that when I am 25years old I would like to get married and have a baby but when I am married. I will still keep my job on for abit I would like to live in a quiet estate and when we moved in I would like the house to be clean but if it was not I would make it clean and tidy. I would like to have a nice nextdoor neighbor and a nice house 
I would still go out to dances and partys with freiends when I am married. when I leave my job I would like to take a part-time job as a nurse or a hairdresser. or if I could not get a part-time job as a nurse or as a hairdresser which I had usually been doing I would try to get apart-time job. as a shop assistent or sometheng. like that anyway. or if not I would stop working altogether.
