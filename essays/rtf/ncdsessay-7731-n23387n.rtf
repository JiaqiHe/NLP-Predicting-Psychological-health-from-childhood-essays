When I am twenty five I would try to get a job something to do with horses and ponies, Like a trainer or a riding instructor. I would be married with two children, and live in the country. By that time my children would have learnt to ride as well. So I would then try and get a Riding stables of my own.
In my spare time I would ride with my family or go swimming. In the childrens school holidays we would go abroad to other contries or even go pony treking.
If I could not have a stables I would have a kennels and train dogs.  Words: 106
