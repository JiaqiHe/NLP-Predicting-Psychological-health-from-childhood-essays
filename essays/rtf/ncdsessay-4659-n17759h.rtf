I live in the country on a farm with my aunt in Ireland. I used to go there every holidays when I was a child and I loved it. I was born In Ireland in [city] and the farm is is County [county]. It is a quiet place and a river runs through the lands. About a mile away there is a small village with a church where my mother got married. My mother and father still live in England where my father is a civil engineer. I have 3 brothers and 2 sisters in the family, I am the second oldest. I love living on the farm because I love animals and the country, it is very peaceful living here. One day I hope to get married and have some children and live on a farm with them in Ireland. There is really only one country I would like to visit and that is Switzerland. I would like to visit it because it sounds very nice up on the Alps in the green fields filled with Alpine flowers and the air is fresh and sweet. Sometimes I would wander far into the fields and paint a picture of the landscape and some-times write poems and stories. I would not like Ireland to change to a busy smokey country but stay the same as when I was child. When my parents Are retired I would like them to come and live with me on a farm with some animals.
