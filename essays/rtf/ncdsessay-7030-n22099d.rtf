      I am a short hand Typist and I work for the bank. I go there at nine and come home at half past four. Sometimes when I have a lot to do I bring some home I have to make the beds, wash up, make the breakfast in the morning. My mate [name] makes dinner does the washing up. and sweep the front room floor.
      At night we all go out dancing and have a smashing time with the boys Im very intrested in dancing We get home about half past ten On Wednesday we go horse racing and have a jolly good time. On Saturday we go out. We go out in late night clubs*.
      Soon it will be time to go to bed and wait for the nexted morning. and sit down in that terable office and do typing. I lead a dull life  Words: 193
