I am now 25 years old! A couple of weeks ago I passed my examination to be a history teacher. My husband is a sailor and I seldom see him so I need something to keep me occupied. I am thrilled at the idea of becoming a history teacher because my favourite hobbys are archaeology and historical interests. One day I was searching for a book about the Domesday Book when I discovered that there was a legend about it being buried under the school I was in then. This legend intrigued me and I began to ask people whether they would succour me with my search for the celebrated book. Myriads of people were interested and so we began to dig in the school grounds. Every body was optimistic when we commenced but soon their mood changed and they gave it up as a bee in a bonnet. I felt under an obligation for telling them it was there and couldn't think how to repay them. I was looking at the gardener of the school one day when he was clearing a piece of land (outside the) which was overgrown. This particular piece of land had been overlooked by the workers because it was full of snails and worms. Then I suddenly wondered whether the book could be concealed under the land. Momentarily the gardener dug up the book and we (went) decided to go to the government to ask what should be done with the book. They said that they would put it in the best known museum and there it has remained ever since. I have repaid the labourers so I am happy.  Words: 276
