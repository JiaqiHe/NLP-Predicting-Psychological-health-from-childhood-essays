I am 25 and live with my mother and father. I have a job in the bank and own a car. My interests are skating and dancing. Once a week I go out to dinner with friends at night. My mother and father are good to me and let me do what I like. 
      On a Sunday we often go to the caravan for the day. If there is a good film on I go and see it with Carolyn my freind I start at 9 o'clock in the morning at work, and finish at 5.30. I am a chasier and have to sort back acounts. Many of the customers are very difficult for they must have everything right. We get 2 weeks for the summer holiday and 2 for Christmas.  Words: 132
