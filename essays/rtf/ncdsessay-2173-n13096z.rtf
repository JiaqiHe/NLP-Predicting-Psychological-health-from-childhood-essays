I am married and have two children my job is a hairdresser and I might go on to be a shorthand typest. I cook the meals and clean up and my children sometimes help me. They have pocket money from my husband and I and they have a bedroom each. My house has three bedrooms a kitchen, and a dinning room and sitting room in one. We live right near a park which has swings and slides in it, it, is very handy for my children, as they often go in it. I sometimes go out to parties and things like that, and so I have to get a baby sitter in, to look after my children.  Words: 117
