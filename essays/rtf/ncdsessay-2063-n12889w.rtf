I think I'd like to be working as a shop keeper I think i would like to work in a shop . Because my big sister works in a shop. So I would like to be the same .
I sometimes play shops with my pal. I dont think i will get married untill I am about 30. When I have children I will not go to work untill my children are all working . My big brother says he is not getting married attall. He is going to stay with my mum all the time . I keep on wishing I was 25 now . I would like to be working just now.
I like school . But I would rather be working still . Or I might even work as an air hostess. I would like to in a airoplane, I have never been in an airoplane . But I'D like in one before I get very older . So I think that will be my job realy.  Words: 168
