When I am twenty five I shall be a footballer and play for Tottenham Hotspur, If I can not play for Tottenham I will try to play for West Ham United, if posible I will try to be a left winger. The left and right wingers have more chance of scoring goals, If I cann't be a left winger I shall be inside left. I may get ingaged and get marrid. The car I will get is a red and white Rover 2000 and I will go to Spain for my yearly holiday, and may be Canada, or Italy.  Words: 99
