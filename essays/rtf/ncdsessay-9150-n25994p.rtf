I am just a house wife I do not work in the day for I have a baby to look after. Some nights I work at a youth club and some one baby sits for me. At youth club I work at the bar and sell things. Some times I dance with the teenagers and talk to them. When I get home my husband and I have some supper and a drink of tea and then go to bed. My hobbies are drawing.  Words: 83
