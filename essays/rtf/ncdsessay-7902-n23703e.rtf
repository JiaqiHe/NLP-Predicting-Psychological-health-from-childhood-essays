When I am 25 years old I would like to be a farmer with my own farm. I would have twenty labours a big dairy and a hundred cows a personal vet. Ten big red tractors and five cars for my labours. I would buy two hundred chickens and I would get six hundred eggs a week and sell them at four and six a dozen. When I went in to my house Rex and Rover my collies would run to me as fast as they could. In the morning I had to be up at five oclock to milk my cows. At eleven o clock a lorry would fetch the milk to take it to my dairy it would be bottled and delivered to peoples door steps. My labours pay would be twenty pounds a week. I hird ten more labours. I sold my farm for six thousand pound. I in a cottage faraway from any noise. I found in the woods a big piece of wood. I took it home and carfed it into a horse. My nephew came to see me he saw the horse and he wanted one. Next time he visited me I gave him a carved horse. I opened a shop with carved animals in it. One day a pricess bought one of my carvings. My nephew looked after the shop for me. I bought a big kennals I had fifty dogs. One night it was burned down. I took over a riding schooll I had twenty lipitzaners and 15 pupils.
