At the age of 25 I would probaly be a kennel maid dogs are my main interest. I don't really know if I would go to college or not. But I don't think kennel maids need any practice. The dog I mostly love is the alakian mountain dog. At home I like polishing, washing up, tideing up. The thing I like a lot is cooking. the thing I hate doing is fetching the coal Then if everything was going fine I would start a kennel myself. I would get myself a sports car I think they are great. I don't think I would like to get married because it might spoil my plans. I like taking my puppy a walk. If I did get married I would lead a happy one. If I was'nt a kennel maid I would most likely be a vet. I would be in a little village so I could consontrate more. I love the countryside because of the foxes and birds its so peaceful. The garden would be full of flowers. Tulips, dalias, daffadils, and flowers like that.  Words: 183
