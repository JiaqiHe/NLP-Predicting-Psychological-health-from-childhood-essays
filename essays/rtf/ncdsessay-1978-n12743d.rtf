I am now a Soldier in the parachutists and I am going to try to become a Sergeant like my father was and sometimes I get leave to go home. now every time I go home my mother asks me why I joined the army but I joined the army because it has been my life ambition and then she would ask me why I don't get married and I just say that Ive never wanted to get married. At the place where I am stationed I share a flat with two friedns and we get our cooked meals from the canteen just down the road and with another three thousand men in the camp you can judge how crowded the canteen would, be, if most of the men werent married. from the canteen you get stewed steak with potatoes and carrots but the officers get chicken with curry and rice and after that they have jam tart and custard and that's only for tonight, we all go to the go kart racing track after our meal and we go swimming.
