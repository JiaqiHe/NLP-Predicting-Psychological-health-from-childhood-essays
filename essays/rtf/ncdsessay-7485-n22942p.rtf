I am in the army I am training to be an officer I have leave sometimes bit not offen it is a hard life but worth it the thing I do not like is the parade and inspection the hand to hand combat is good and the target practis and charching practis is good you do wieght lifting and physical traning at the dining has which is called the mess you get food like in a self serves cafe. The food is good and you get a lot. It is a good live in the army the real pofeshenals can do almost anything you can sign in for 5 years I realy like the army my farther was in the army in a tank sqadron. the training is hard until you get use to it then it gets good and a lot easyer soon I will be a pofesonal I have signed in for ten years I have been in 6 years I want to get to captain or warren officer when I am a captain I might lead a platoon the pay is good I am now learning how to take mortes rifles and macine guns apart to clean. When you are an officer you can go to night shows and clubs called officers clubs. I do'nt like parade and inspection because it is so early in the morning. I might cholefy for an enginer and mend tanks jeeps and trucks an enginer is very inportent.  Words: 247
