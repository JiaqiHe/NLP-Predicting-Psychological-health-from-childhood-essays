I am 25 years old and I think I lead a very good life. There is quite a lot of subjects that I am interested on such as cricket, tennis, rugby and most of all football. I like football very much. I show my kids how I train at home in the garden. I would also teach them something too. As soon as I bought my house I papered it painted it and of course furniture came first. I made a new house out of what it was. Soon there were flowers in the garden but they were not all over it. There were still plenty of spare parts left and I built a garage and I built a shed in which I worked. When it was a nice day the kids would ask me to come out and play with them of course this kind of thing was not for me but I went and played with them for a little while. The funny thing was they always wanted to play cowboys and indians and I got dirty every time. So I bought them a wigwam and cowboy and indian suits and they played them selves. Some times I would take them to the Zoo, the park, the seaside or a football match. Of course they chose where they wanted to go and they always chose the park ofr a gootball match. When they wanted to go to a football match I had to buy them everything. I had to buy them scarves, flags, banners and sweets.  Words: 258
