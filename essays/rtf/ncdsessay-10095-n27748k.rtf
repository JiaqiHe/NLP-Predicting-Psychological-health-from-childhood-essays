Now I am 25 I will jion the Royal air force and become a pilot. I will goto the recruiting office tomorrow. Next day I went to the recruiting office for more details. When I got there it was 11 o'clock and there were six people in there so I went in and sat down. I got to know the men and we talked for a long time. They went into a seperate office to be interviewed when they had all gone I was by myself so I started to read a paper. About 10 minuets later it was my turn and someone else walked through to the waiting room. When I  got inside I was told to sit down and then a man started to ask me quistions about what I used to do I answerd that one by saying I have'ent had a job yet. He asked me what I wanted to be in the airforce I said a pilot. He told me to report to the commanding officer at [RAF station] next week. The next week passed quickly and when Monday came I went to [RAF station] and reported to the c/o he told me to go to the flight Luitenentt I went to him and told him what I wanted to be and he told me to sign on and serve 2 or 3 years so I signed on for 3 years. I started of a bit scared but after a while I got used to it I get pushed about a bit but I did'ent mind. After a year had Passed and I was 26 years old I was only another years training that stoped me from being a pilot. After that year I became a pilot and the third year I was posted to spain.
