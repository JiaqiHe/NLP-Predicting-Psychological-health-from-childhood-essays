I am an air hostess I work for the [company] I fly to a lot of countrys I've been to Italy, France, Germany, Swizland, Spain, Denmark and Ireland. The people in Spain are very friendly some of them speak English but I prefer the Spanish languag. The town I once went to was called Seviooe where they grow oranges the house there were built with white stone they have flat roofs. It was a very hot town. I did not stay there long as the plane was leaving at half past three. When I got on the plane the people there were mostly spanish I asked them to fasten their seat belts and to stop smoking. As soon as the plane had been in the sky ten minutes I told the passengers that they could undo their seat belts and smoke. There was a baby so I asked the Mother if the baby would like some milk. But the Mother said she had plenty of it in her bag. I asked the other passengers would like any thing. I went into the kitchen and make coffee I opened bottles and tins of cool drinks. Soon I was telling the passengers to fasten their seat belts up and stop smoking. We began to lower and soon we stoped I opened the door and the men brought the stairs the passengers walked out. I phoned a taxi to my flat when I got there everything was dusty so I started to clean after I had done that I went to see a display with my friend at the Gymnasiuer Gymn was my hobby. I hoped to see some of it at Belguim soon.  Words: 281
