I am 25 and have a part-time job. as a Kennal - maid I have 3 rabbits and 5 dogs. I have a little cottage and live by my-self. The cottage has a fairly big garden. I live almost in the country and can hear the birds singing outside It is nearly always sunny and I have a nice time. I will not marry as it is nice and quiet and I like it here and I do not want children runnig about and upsetting the peace. I may buy an old horse and let it live in the garden. Because it will not ruin the garden by running about. All the garden is (covered) closed in by a hedge. The life I lead may seem dull but I like it and would not want to leave it.  Words: 138
