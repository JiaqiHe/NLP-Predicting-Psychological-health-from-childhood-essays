I get up at about half past six and go down stairs to get my breakfast. I go to work at about seven and I work on a Bilding site. In my dinner hour I usualy go and get my dinner at a cafe or have some sandwishes. I come home at six and then have my tea. Some wekkend's I like going to car races like scrambles or car rallyes. At home I like working in the garden or going out in the car or taking pictures with my camera*. At night I like watching a film or reading a book. I go to bed at about ten o'clock and read in bed.
