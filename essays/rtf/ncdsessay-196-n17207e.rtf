I will work on a farm when Im off ill go fish or play football with the other men. I have always like farm work its the cattle and sheep. I like best of all I like shooting pigons and crows which are pests to corn and chickens. When it is hay time I will bail the field. Then we will put them in stacks most farmers leave there bails to dry, but the weather is so dry that we dont have too. When we load the barn up with bails of hay. One of the other men set the barn on fire but its got put out by the fire brigade some hours later he was sacked.  Words: 118
