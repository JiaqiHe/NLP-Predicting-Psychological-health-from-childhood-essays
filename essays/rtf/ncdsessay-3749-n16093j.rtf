I am 25 years old and I am going to college to study to become a nursery school teacher. I love children and am enjoying myself. I stay in a flat with another girl who is at college, the same as me at the weekends I go home and see my parents and go out and enjoy myself. When I'm staying at the flat I don't go out many nights to the cinema or the theatre with (name) ( the girl I stay in the flat with). at the weekends I love to go swimming and playing tennis with my brother. (name) goes out a few nights a week but we have to study a lot sometimes I wonder if I should have become a very or a teacher. When i left school I got a job as an acocuntant but I could not settle so I came here. I love the holidays when I can go out instead of studying hard. In the summer I am always swimming every day . My work at the moment . is mostly out at the schools on teaching practise. but I go up to college twice every month. In my first year and the second I got the same as ,the students wanting to become primary school teachers but in the third year I got special training to become a nursery teacher. It is hard work but rewarding I love reading adventure books , mystery stories , and horror books. When I go home at weekends I love looking after my pet rabbit , she is lovely. My mother and father are lovely and very kind.  Words: 274
