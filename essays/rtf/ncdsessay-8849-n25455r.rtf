When I am 25 I want to be eather a chemist , press photographer or an electronic engineer , Most of all I want to be a press photographer. I want to work with any of Britain's leading newspapers. I have always hoped that when some big accident occurs I will be carrying my camera with me and be able to photograph it the second it happens. so far I have had no luck. When I grow up I had hoped to live in the (place) , but there will be no newspapers there so I think I will live in (place) and by a small house up in the (place) as well . When i am 25 I hope that I will have passed my driving test and that i will be able to a car. I would like a Volvo - but in 14 years they may be no longer made .
I also wish to get a pilot's licence , and if I pass the test I will hire , or even buy a small areoplane .
I think that when I am twenty - five my main hobby will still be photography and I will still devote most of my spare time to developing films.  Words: 207
