"My interests are Studying birds and whatching them. The resen of this is that they are every day things, and things that you See every day. Some birds are intresting to watch. The life I'm leading is very hospitalaty. I get invited to parties very often. I like my work which is carpentory. I me*s aroud with old telivisons, and radios. I find life at the age of 25 very intresting. I like Sitting at home reading books about birds and war Stories. Carpentory is intresting becauce you have the day of making things. Some people are Ingisetive they ask quations like ""where have you been"" and ""why are you dressed up like that"". Some people think about marrge at my age. But not me I'm going to try to Stay a Bachulor. The main part of my life is my work I like it and find Joy in it. You can learn things from it The main thing I like is the Sawing and the nailing together. Somtimes I Sit and watch televion. I go to youth clubs and other clubs,"  Words: 182
