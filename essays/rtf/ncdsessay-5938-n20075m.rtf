----------------------
I work in a hospital as a 'Staff Nurse', I work in a childrens ward. It is very interesting work. Sometimes I helped in an operating theatre. Every six-months all the nurses in the hospital have an examination, which includes X-rays of the body, for all nurses have to be in perfect health.
      I always go to the Annual Hospital dances, and enjoy myself tremendously. I really lead a most easy life except when I'm at work sometimes.
      I am married and have two children, a boy and a girl, [name], the eldest who is only 5 is quite intelligent in her way and, [name], the youngest is 2. My Husband, two children and I, all live in a lovely 3 bedroomed house in [address]. We all live very happily together indeed. 
      My personal interests are, riding on my lovely horse, 'Galliant' with [name] my friend, and going swimming in the big indoor swimming-pool. 
      Every now and again I have a little party in my house which I invite some of my friends at the hospital and at home to.
      I would never swop my life for anything at all, I very much enjoy it.  Words: 197
