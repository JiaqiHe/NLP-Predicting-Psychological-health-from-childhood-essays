When I am twenty-five years old I will like to cook and bake different things. Also I would be working in town. I am working now in town, at in an office. Usually after work I look round the shops for about half an hour and then I get the bus back home and then cook my tea. Every Saturday morning I vac the dining-room and the front room. I start work at half past eight and leave work at about five o' clock. 
Every Saturday afternoon I have an early lunch and then get ready to go to town at about two o' clock. I really enjoy myself then. I usually reach home at about half past four.
I used to have a flat for about half a year, but I did not like it so I have now bought another new house. I have now got quite a large garden. Every two weeks I spend about two hours on it. I have got quite a big back garden, but a small front one. 
When I first went to work I felt right strange, but after a few days had gone by I settled down. The office is quite a big one. Altogether there are about twenty of us. There are ten men and ten ladys. At dinner time we all go down to the canteen. The dinners are are quite good. Sometimes when we have to work over we have our teas there too. When we do work over we usually finish about seven o' clock and then I get home abou half past seven.  Words: 266
