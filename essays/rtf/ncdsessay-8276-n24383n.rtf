"Today it is my 25th birthday, the children at the school where I work as a teacher gave me a lovely new ""Parker"" fountain pen. The teachers gave me a new frying pan as they know one of my main interests is cooking, but my favourite present of all was from my husband and two daughters they got me a lovely golden labroudor puppy. I had 10 cards but the one I liked best was from [female name] and [female name] my 3 year old twins. One of my many interests is riding and I go every Friday afternoon as Friday is my day off, I want the twins to start riding as soon as possible as I think it would be nice to go for a picnic on horse-back. My other main interest is cooking I have got quite good at this now but when I first started it was a different matter I recently found a flower arranging class but I find it rather boring, so I'm thinking of leaving it."
