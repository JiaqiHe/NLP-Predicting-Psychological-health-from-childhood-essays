I also help at the baths on a Sunday morning. My husband and I go out on a Friday night together and we take my little girl out on a Saturday for a meal then we take he to the pictures. On a Sunday morning I take my little girl with me to the baths. When we come back from the baths we sometimes go to my mothers or my husband mothers. This year for our holidays we are going to Switserland for 3 weeks then when we come back we will go a day here and there. When I start back at my work I will have to get new hairdriers in the shop and new trays for the rollers and the clips. I will also have to get another assistant as I have made the shop bigger.
