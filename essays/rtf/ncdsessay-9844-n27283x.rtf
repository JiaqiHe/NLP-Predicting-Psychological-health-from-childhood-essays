I am a doctor and I work at an international hospital in Italy. I am married and I have got two children 1 boy and 1 girl and they are both four years old. Not* far* from where I live is the sea and I go swimming in it nearly every weekend. I am still colecting stamps and coins and I have got very many of each. I have got a car and I have been to nearly every town on city in Italy. I go* to visit my father and mother every year. I go to England once every four years just so that I won't forget it.
