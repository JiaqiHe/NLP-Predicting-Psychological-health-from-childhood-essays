I am now 25 years old and I am leading a life of a teacher. I am married and have two children aged one and three. I went to college for three years to train. My children are looked after by my mother during the day and I am there in the evening.
      My husband works in a factory and gets fairly good wages. We agreed that we would work are way up to top class people as we both want to lead our own life not take pride for what we didnt earn. My home life is very intresting as I am a mother who wants to be domesticated. Our house is just outside [city] and it is on a new estate. We have a front and back garden. The inside of our home, we have bought everything except the things that were given to us for wedding presents. My job, I work at an infant school it is just outside the estate. It was always my ambition to be a teacher so I don't think I will pack it in unless it is really nessecary. I wanted to be a teacher from when I left junior school as I thought I would enjoy it.
      I find enough time to do all the things I want to do. In my spare time I play with my children as I love them very much. I especially like cooking and now I make a few clothes for myself. We are going to take our children to our mothers house for a few days. I do not want my children to be spoiled and selfish so we don't give them everything they want.  Words: 281
