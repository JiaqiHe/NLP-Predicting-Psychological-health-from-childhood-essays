I teach Horse riding for a living look after my young son who is about three. We have a Stud fare we have about 20 horses. We have a house down in the [mountains] in Wales we keep a dog and a cat. We often take the horses for a gallop around the mountins then we come home and groom them. Each night we come and give them their food of oats an carrot mixed with boiled water. In the morning I wash up do the ironing wash the horses brushes in disinfectant and scrap the curry comb. Then I go up stairs to wash and get dressed. My husband owns a firm called [company] which makes copper bosses and things like that in the summer we let the horses rome a round but at night we bring them back give them their food and put them in their stables. If it has been raining we day them dowen and put a rug over them. We have one prise pony he jump's very high he is an arab. We have won over a hundred rosets with him his name is Flika. We have a Stalion which has won man cross country races.  Words: 202
