If I was 25 now I would have a car and caravan if I could aford it and have the caravan on a caravan site, which I would use most weekends and when I'm not using it I would let other people use it for the week or weekend.
In the week days I would go to work somewhere and when I have finished work I would go up a playing field with some of my mates and have a game football.  Words: 81
