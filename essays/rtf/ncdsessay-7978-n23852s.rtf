Now that I am 25 year old I have a home and I work at night. I am interested in a lot of thinghs. the life I am leading is interesting. My home life is keeping the house clean and wallpapering every year and painting thinghs like that. I will go and see my mam once or twice a week. My work will be on a night so I can watch the house all of the day. Then work I hope at the [name of employer] where they make telephones it will be nice to work on the nights. My interests are in the house and out of the house the thinghs out of the house is going shopping and going to see my freinds. When Sunday comes I will go for a walk if it is fine then I would do some sowing and knitting thinghs like that. When it is raning I would tidy up and put and put a big fire on and put the firegaurd up and go to sleep on a chair. I would then make the tea and gettx get ready for work go down to the village for the bus after I locked the doors. When work was over I would come home and put the kettle on and have my supure and a cup of tea watch the television and go and lock the door and go to bed.  Words: 237
