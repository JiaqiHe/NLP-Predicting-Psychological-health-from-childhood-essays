I have a home and I am a bacheler. I have a car and a garage. I'v never been in a car crash and been hurt. I have a job at the airlines, as a piolet. I have been to many different countries. The first country I went to was Canada. My Sister went there when she was twenty four years old. I have always wanted to be a piolet, and in my spare time I make models with clay or limestone. I am interested in skulpting because you'v got to have a steady. hands* I like pioleting because when I was a boy I had model Herricane that had an engin. The engin was a mark two*. At home I do all my own cooking and washing up. my house is a bunglow. It has five rooms (1) bedroom. (2) bath roon (3) small liveing roon (4) small dinning room (5) kitchin. Sometimes I stay with freinds who live in the country on a farm. The farm is a big one and there is plenty of fresh* air. My freinds next door are very kind. Sometimes the neighbore comes in and tidies the house up for me. Every week I have a day off work for a rest. The next country I go to is Australia, over the other side of the world, it is a long way to fly, but we stop five times on our way there. We refule three times altogether and our way there. I fly at 7,600 feet at 650 miles per hour. We go very fast in the aeroplane, which is one of the fastest in the world.  Words: 275
