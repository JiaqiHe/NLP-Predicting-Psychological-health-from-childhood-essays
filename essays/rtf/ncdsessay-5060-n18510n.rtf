When I am 25 years old I would like to go to Eg--ypt and learn about the pyramids and anc--ient relects there. I know quite a lot about them but would like to see them for myself In my spare time I would like to visit the (place) museums where there are many things of ancient Egypt. I would like to find many things myself. I would like to learn about the pharoes and how they lived. Some of the oldest pyramids just look like hills of stone and sand. and might not be discovered. When I have learnt about Egypt for some time I would like to be an arceoligist there, and live there. at home I would like to read books, and go out in the warm weather. I would also like to visit the (place), where (name) tomb was found.It would be a very interesting life.  Words: 149
