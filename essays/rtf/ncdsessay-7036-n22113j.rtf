"I am now buying valuable coins for high prices and I have a collection of about one thousand coins. I have just bought two coins for xxxx50 each. I am quite well known among coin dellers. When I am thirty I am going to try to get a job as an astronomer at Mount Palamer and if I don't I'll try and get one somewhere else. If I do get the job I will collect my coins in spare time that I might get. when and if I get the job I hope to discover something that the whole world will thank me for.
I am, at the moment, a vice manager of a small factory. I get one hundred pounds every six months for my salary. My Mother is 54 and I look after her and cook her meals. My Father is 56 and he helps me with my work and with the meals.
Two of my sisters are married ([female name] and [female name]) and have small families. [female name] is engaged to be married in a month and [female name] is engaged to be married in 6 months.
At night I study the stars and look at the moon with a powerful Saturn Reflector which is a telescope which is 3' 6"" long and 2"" wide. 
I hope I do get the job and live a long life."  Words: 228
