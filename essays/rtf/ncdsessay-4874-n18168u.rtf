I am 25 years old. I am married and have got two children. I do all the housework and the cooking. The housework I do on a Saturday and the cooking at night. Sometimes my husband and I go out to the pictures or for a ride in the car. My husband has got brown eyes the same as me. On Sundays Our relations come to see us or we go to see them. At night I do dressmaking for other people, and they are very grateful. Sometimes I make things for the children. If I have not got any dressmaking to do I do some knitting. When I do the shopping I take my children with me. We are very lucky because the shops are just down the road. Sometimes we go swimming on Sunday morning. we are teaching the children to swim. we have got a big garden for the children to play in with a swing in it. we have got quite a big house. When the children are older I will probably go work in a florist. I have got a stamp book and if I see a stamp which is worth keeping I take if off a letter and keep it. When I have got a lot of stamps I put them in the stamp book. In the summer we go down to Wales for our holiday. Sometimes we go in a Butlins Holiday camp to stay for a week.  Words: 245
