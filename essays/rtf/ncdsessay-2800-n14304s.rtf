My name now is Mr [name] and not master [name]. I am twentey five years old and Iam happaley married. I live in a small bungalow in the countrey. The thing I like most about the house is the small cute windows and the red bricks. I have a red E - type jaguar in the garage to take my wife and the baby out for their plesure. The house is quiet and by itself, I often have to go six mile in the car too get our food supplies in the small town of [town]. They are five rooms in the bungalow, a kithen, a sitting room, a dinning room and two bed rooms. At the back of the house we keep hens so we can get eggs from them. We also keep a Alsation dog to keep away any foxes that venture near. When you come in the frount door the first thing you see a litle plated piture and on it you can see the words Home Sweet Home. Every time you see the singe it makes me smile. I have got a job of which I have always dremt about I have made my self a proffesonal footballer. I have just been capped to play for England to play West Germany in the Semi-final of the World Cup. I get very good pay being a footballer so* I desided to take my Wife and baby on a trip to Cornwall and Devon in a Caravet for a month. I think the next year I will take them on a trip to sunney Spain I am very happy and I hope life will carrey on the same way at Home Sweet Home  Words: 285
