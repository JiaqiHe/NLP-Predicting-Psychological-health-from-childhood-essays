I also ride horses and there are a lot of horses I am very fond of, I go riding on a chesnut mere and I mainly go riding in the summer I think hores are lovly animals I think they are the best animals made I also have a fish and a budgie and they are nice to. I have quite a few friends and they are all very good to me. In my spare time I do some knitting for my family but I don't get on very well. On saturdays if its nice we go on picnics and we have a really nice time. Another thing I like doing is embrodring table cloths and things. they are all the things I like doing  Words: 164
