I am 25 years old go to University and I am learning to be a pharmacist. In this there is a lot of studying. Mixing different substances is qiute hard because I sometimes mix the wrong ones. I am learning fast and becoming a good apprentice. I am leading a quiet life. The food at University is very good. I like the life and hope to be a full time pharmacist. My interests are Archeology and the study of insects. In my spare time I read books about Pharmacy and Archeology. Once I went on an expedition to Egypt. There I learned more about Pharmacy off the Egyptions. They told me about some old remedies and I learned them off by heart. I also learned alot about Archeology off a proffessor I saw there. He told me that I could go into a pyramid that he had excavated and there, there was golden statues and Idols. The Prof' taught me all he knows and that was a lot. There was a lot of insects for me to catch and study including Mosquito's. When I came back to England I had a rather big collection of insects. And a book of remedies and information about Archeology. Later that year I became a fully qualified Pharmacist and opened a Chemists shop in Cambridge under the name of S. Donkins CHEMIST and REMIDIES SHOP. I made a reasonable profit and liked the job until I retired and lived in luxury until I died.  Words: 250
