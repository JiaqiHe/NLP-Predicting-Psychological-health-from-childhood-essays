I am 25 and I am a gym teacher. When I was 19 I went in the Olympic Games with my two friends Diana and Angela. When I was a little girl I became the South West under 13 gymnastic champion. But now I am to old for that so I took up coaching.
I am married and I have a child of three her name is [female name].
My home is in Scotland, and it is very big. I have a horse as well as dogs, cats, rabbits, birds, hens, and a mouse. The area around the house is woodland and moors there is a lake about a mile from the house where my husband goes fishing. We sometimes drive down to my mother in England she lives in Taunton. We can't go to my husband's house because it is in Australia.  Words: 141
