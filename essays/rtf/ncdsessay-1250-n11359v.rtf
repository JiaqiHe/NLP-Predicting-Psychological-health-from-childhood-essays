I am still at collage. I am training to be a pilot for Boac airlines. I live in a flat in the west of London. I have a small car to get a-round in. I am usually out for most of the day, but I come home at 6 o'clock and have a meal. After that I play records untill 8 o'clock then I go out to a pub.
Some nights I go and see my grandmother or my uncle and Arntie. At the weekends I go and stay with my mother and father up north. In the evening we all go for a drive. In the after-noon we might go and see a cricket match. In a weekes time I be come a fully qualifide pilot then I am aloud to fly a aircraft. I will be flying the 9.30 to New York, I can stay in New York for a day then I catch the 1 o'clock to London. I like to play cricket and I am a resavere player for the Yorkshire cricket club. My ambishon was to see the world and so I became a pilot. I have meet three of my old school friends in London. I am getting a lot of money so I have thought myself a new car. Being a pilot is a hard job because you have to fly at all hours. Every now and then you have to have a cheak up to see if you a fit enuff to fly.  Words: 250
