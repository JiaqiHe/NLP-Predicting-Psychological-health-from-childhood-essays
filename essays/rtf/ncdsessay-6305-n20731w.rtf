I would be either a banker or a teacher. I am married and have a family of my own in my own house and my interests are sewing and reading some nights going out to the cinema but my main one to look after my family and home. My job would be that I am mixing with other people and enjoying my life. Ocain. Ocasionally I would go out on outings or to dances so that I do not always stay at home but enjoy myself I would like to have children who would come first in what I did and so that they can grow up well looked after and educated and I would teach them to look after their selves as soon as they were old enough My interests at home would be some to stay at home with my family watching the television with them & having hobbies which that I would like to do & doing jobs in my home so that it would be comfortable. Going out some nights but first making sure that my children were safe & well looked after by a baby sitter or neighbour.  Words: 193
