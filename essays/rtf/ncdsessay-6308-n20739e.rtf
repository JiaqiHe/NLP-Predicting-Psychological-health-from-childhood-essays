As I start of to work on Thursday morning at the ground of (place). I am a grounds man and have many jobs. To start the day I have to line the pitch which takes about an hour and quarter when I have done that I can put up the nets for the reserve match in the afternoon. When I have done that I have to clean the charging rooms and wash the walls in the tiolet. I go home for dinner when I have finished these jobs. So in the afternoon I come and watch the match. After the match I come home and have an egg or I feed my dog and gold fish.  Words: 116
