My Life AT Twenty-Five.
If I was, 25 year old I would like to travel round the world and see my uncle in Amecra, and read a lot of books and maybe be come a marryed woman and have, some children, and help in a. school. I would. like to have a baby to look after in my spare time. And maybe when I'm 31, I will go and see, the place where our lady appeared to Bernadette, and, pray for guidance. through my life, My huband will do all the work. and will have no spare time.
I would like to have some, dogs, cats and some rabbits when my children were grown up I would go out to work untill I was tiedd and wanted to stop. And then I would start to do something and then I would be ready for my death bed.  Words: 145
