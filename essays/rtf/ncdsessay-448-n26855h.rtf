When I am 25 years old, I think I might be in the army with my friends. I should meet a lot of my friends. These are some off the games I think we might do, football, swimming, cricket, basketball, staying in different countries when wintre comes. I should think I shall stay in the army about four or five years. I will get a sports car, if I can aford it. I will get married I'll go in to the army becuase it sounds very good fun, by the things we do and the games we play the guns are fine. The training of climbing up and over all climbing up and down bases and capes firing at the targets charging with a bannet at some dumies. I like nealy tasks of war and all [illegible] of things. When I'm in the army I may be a [illegible] driver. When I go home for the holidays I shall look after my perants and tell them all about my career in the army. When I leave the army I might go straight for a job at a backyard or some place.  Words: 191
