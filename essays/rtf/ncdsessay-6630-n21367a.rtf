First I would get a job which interested me then I would find a room in a hotel and there I would live. When I had finished my work I would come home and tidy my room. Then I would go out riding on horses when I brought back the horse I would go home to change then I would go to visite my parents or go out with a boyfreind if I had one. After that I would get washed or have a shower and go to bed. And when it was morning again I would get up get washed and dressed eat and go to work. When it was my day off I would go to the park or somthing like that or shring clean my room and when I had shring cleand my room I would go out to the shops to buy things if I needed anything. After I had lived in my room for about a week I would go to the shops to buy things for it such as wall paper and a carpet and paint set and re decorate my room. Then I would go to the pet shop to buy a pet.  Words: 200
