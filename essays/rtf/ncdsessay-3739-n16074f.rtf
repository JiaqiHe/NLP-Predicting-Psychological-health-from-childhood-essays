I am working at the (place) and I play against (team) on Saturday. I will be playing inside right. I have scored 5 goals for the team . I used to play for there second team.
My home is in a busy part of (place). There is one thing I do not like about (place) is that there are too many people without homes or have homes, but which have not got proper roofs and the other thing about the house. On my spare time I like to take a trip from the aiport. 
My parents are both working, but they get the day of on Saturday and Sunday. On Saturday my father sometimes come to see me playing at football. My brother is still at school, so I sometimes do not see him very much .
I sometimes go to the swimming pool to cool myself off, also at the pool I help other people to learn to swim.
Most of the time I am training for the football games. So I better be getting back to the training.  Words: 177
