I am 25 years old. My job is being a fireman. In my spare time I go birdwatching to reserves. My house is not a big one. Just near a country road in a small village. Nearby is a little town not very noisy and not much traffic. I enjoy my work as a fireman for the small town. I get pay even when I dont work. There are'nt many fires so I am not always busy. In my back garden are cadges with hurt, baby, or fledgling birds. Looking after them is quite exciting. I enjoy riding my motor bike about but I dont exeed the speed limit. I have quite a few friends in the village and I am quite popular.  Words: 123
