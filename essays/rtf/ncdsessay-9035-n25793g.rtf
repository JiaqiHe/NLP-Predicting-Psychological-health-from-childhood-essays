I am in the Royal Air Force. One of my main jobs is designing aeroplanes as well as flying them. My favourite plane is the Hawker Hunter in which I flew in an airshow.
A few weeks ago I asked the Flight-Lieutenant if I could have a mechanic to help me renew the cockpit of the new Hurricanes which he ordered. He let me have one. I soon showed my assistant what I had planned to do. He thought it was quite a good plan. After a few weeks we had changed the mechanism of the hood opening when a lever was pulled.
Last year I married a young woman named [female name] [surname]. Yesterday morning my wife had to go to hospital because she had received a baby son. We had decided that we would name him [male name] [male name].  Words: 140
