"I have studies to be a vet and have become one. I love it very much. I have a hores its name is ""Stardust"" he is black, and has a very good nature, but sometimes he is noty. 
There is a kennal that is down the road a bit. It has lovely dog's. There is a brown spaniel that has been knockend down by a bus. I go down to see him sometimes, his name is ""Turk"". I like him very much.
I go out for a ride when I can, and my children [female name] and [female name] always say they will ride him some day too. They come down to the kennels with me some times, they say they are down to help, but they are not realy.
I promest [female name] and [female name] I would by them a pony too. As they love animals as much as I do.
And I am saving up for a holiday in Africa, I have always wanted to go their. Too see all the wild animals to me would be like a dream come true.
And I will go on doing what I can for animals."  Words: 192
