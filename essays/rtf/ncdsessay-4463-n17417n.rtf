I start work at 8 o'clock every morning for my job is a Opticians Assistant. I have a break at eleven o'clock and then work till half past two. When I have finished my job I go down town to get something for the tea I have to pay 2 shillings to get home by bus. When I get home I do all the house work eg. 'wash up, polish, clean the oven and sweep the kitchen floor.' I have to do all the bedrooms as well and quickely too because at four o'clock I dash down to the new infant school ([school name].) to bring my daughter home they call her [female name]. She has dark skin and has big brown eyes, she has long brown hair and she has a second tooth. My husband is call [male name] like my father he has dark skin and a pair of blue eyes and has one false tooth. I have brown eyes and havent got dark or* fair skin it's just medium, and I have no false teeth.
My husbands job is a mechanic and he gets 20 hundred new pence a week, as I only get 15. Our house does not belong to the corporation it is our very own. It has a dining room which we hardly use and a libraray, up stairs we have three bedrooms two bath-rooms and one shower. The kitchen isn't very big it has jsut enough room for three elephants to fit in. My birthday is in March the third it is the second of March and the next day a brand new life will happen when I'm 26 Years old.  Words: 277
