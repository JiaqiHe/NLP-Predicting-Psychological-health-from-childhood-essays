I am now twenty five years of age and I am interested in football and a few other sort of sport. I am also interested in being a teacher because you can do a lot of things there. I wouldn't really mind of joining the army because you can also do quite different things and learn how to drive a tank, then when I am on leave I would go home for a while and see how the rest of the family is getting on. Other things that interest me are being an architect because I am quite good at drawing. I would also like to know how to control an areoplane. If I am to stay home I will get a job in an office.
