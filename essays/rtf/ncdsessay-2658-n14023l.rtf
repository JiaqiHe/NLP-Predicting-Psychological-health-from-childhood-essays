At 25 football is my main sport and I play for watford as a full time profesional. **** is the manager and we are doing well together. I have scored 12 goals already, this is my 2nd season I scored 30 goals last season so I hope to get 30 or more goals thi* season and ken says I am on great form. My part time work is a printer and developer of film at one of the big printing factorys its down by the **** fire station its where papers are printed and some of the comics and soccer books are also printed I have a great freind who work works with me at **** his name is **** I have known him since I was 10 years old he and his dad took me by car to watch **** who I now play for. My home is one of the new block of flats and steve lives still at **** in the **** but he comes over to pick me up in the car to go to work. I like steve because he is in the Watford team he joined the same time as I did and now we both play together and steve has scored the same amount of goals as me. I am now going to get a car with the money I earn from football and printing. I am getting a zepher mark 4 in a dark blue colour. I have taken driving lessons each monday evening.  Words: 252
