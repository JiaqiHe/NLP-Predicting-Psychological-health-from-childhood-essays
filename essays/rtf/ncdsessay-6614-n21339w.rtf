When I am 25 years old I hope to be an artificer in the navy and be living in portsmouth, with my wife and two children. And my Job in the navy would be a radio operater, and when I came home on leave I would take my wife and two children two the cinema, and after we had seen the film, we would go out to a late night supper, and the next day I would pant some seeds in the garden, and after my leave had ended I would go back onto the ship.
