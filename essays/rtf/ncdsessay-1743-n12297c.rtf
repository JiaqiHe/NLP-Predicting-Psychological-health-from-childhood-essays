When I am 25 I will have hoped just have finished the training of a nurse and been one for about two years. Then I will get married get a cottage in the country with a big garden. Then I will start breeding and keeping siamese cats as I like them very much. And keep and feed them myself while my husbands at work. Once a month I will go abroad to some to some tropical island to teach them heal them and show them how to build houses and then see if they have any more specimens of siamese cats. I hope to have two children oneboy one girl and to send them to the little school in the small village not far away. And once every two weeks I'll go into town 20 mls away for my shopping and to visit some of my friends who I met where I was studying for my job. And then twice a year I would go and stay with us. I also would like a pond clean fresh and alright for swimming in where I would go once a week or maybe twice.  Words: 192
