When I am at the age of twenty five. I hope to be a part time racing driver. But I shall have to work very hard to raise the money to buy a car for my jop I hope to be a police man or Join the R.A.F: When I am home I shall build kits or planes cars bikes etc. . .When I can afford it I would like to have a home of my own. Now nearly every day I do my paper rounld for a lady called Mrs ****. We have a caravan and I enjoy staying on holiday in it.  Words: 104
