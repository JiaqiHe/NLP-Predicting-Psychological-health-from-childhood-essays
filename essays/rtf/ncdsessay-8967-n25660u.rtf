I am 25 I am an air hostess. I enjoy it very much, I have just returned from Singapore, where I had a job of* weighing people's luggage. I love travelling and have been round the world twice. I can speak French, German. and Spanish. 
      I go back to my home about once a month, as I spend most of my life abroad. I have just become engaged to a Frenchman. He exports wines to England.
      My hobbies include tennis, swineming and photography.
      Next weekend I am going to Morocco with my sister [name], who is 24, for a holiday. I have not  been before and have always longed to go and here is my chance. My sister is married. She lives near [town]. She was a secretary before she got married.
      I enjoy racing, but I hardly ever have time to go as I am normally working or seeing friends I havn't seen for years!  Words: 157
