I am after a job of a fireman working at the phones and sending the fire engine to the fires and putting them out to put the fires out with the hoses . Then when they come in have a nice meal ready for them and after it go out and clean the fire engine and play at darts with them when they come in. Then when they go home and get their get their dinner have a rest and go to the club. and have a drinks.  Words: 88
