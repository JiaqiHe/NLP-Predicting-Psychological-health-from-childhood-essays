I live in a house with my husband. We have two children. I do not go to work as I have to look after my children. My children are a boy and a girl. I am interested in children, how they should be looked after and how they like school. My son goes to school but my daughter does not. I get up at 7.30am each morning, we have breackfast and at 8.15am my husband goes to work. I wash up and dress the children. At 8.40am my son goes to school. Sometimes we go shopping. I always go shopping on Friday to get stocked up for the weekends. I wear quite modern clothes and we spend most of our money on improvements on the house.  Words: 126
