At the age of 25, I am a Proffesional Footballer. I live in Essex, And Play for Tottenham Hotspur. My home life is a pleasant and quiet one. If your a Proffesional Footballer, you'v got to be tough. Some kids who join think its easy, but I'm not kidding, it's a dead hard life. Training is quite difficult. Three days every* week we do training in the gym, and for the remaining two days, we do training at our headquarters. On Sundays I have a day off.
At home I have a wife and two boys, Peter and John. So, on Sundays are the only time we are really together. We usually go out for tea or lunch, but if we don't, we just sit at home, and watch television.
My interests, well I know football doesn't last for ever, so I have opened up a sports shop in Essex, with my former colleague Jon Sherrington.
just one more hint for you youngsters, remember to have a good Eduacation behind you.  Words: 168
