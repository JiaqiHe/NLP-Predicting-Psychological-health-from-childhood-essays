I am [name], cheif computer engineer at the [company] computer factory [town] branch I lead a normal life, going to work in the morning to work, going home in the afternoon. then going out that night. Life is getting much easier as a world goverrnment has been formed and all other rulers abolished. My main intrest is making half scale radio controled models of old 1970 jets. My home-life is realy fantastic. I live with my wife and children in the grotto a house that looks like a cave from the outside and is psyaadelic inside, the floors are in all sorts of wierd patterns and the walls are convex and concave, you can't go wrong with that description. In the weekends I fly my aeroplanes and play football for '[football club]' we are top of earth league at the moment. Men have landed on the moon and established a moon colony. Men have also got to Mars and have discovered Martians. What I have written here is a very good example of life today.  Words: 175
