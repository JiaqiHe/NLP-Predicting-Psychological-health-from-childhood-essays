I am not married . I'm the gym teacher at (school). The school has a very nice gym, and playfeild, with two football pitches.
I like the children there very much. They do what I say , and don't take advantage of me as I am a newcomer.
The gym has handle bars to climb on and ropes to climp up. There are also bars to walk on . and bars to hold onto.
I have been there only three weeks , and the infants have already learned to walk along the bar. I hope I will have many happy years there and I also hope the childne will continue to learn' more things  Words: 111
