I Came home from work with an interesting disign on my mind. I thought about building a new park. I went into the drawing room and began to draw out the plans. I began by putting in the buildings. After the buildings I put in the play things. There would be a concrete ship with stairs and cabins in it which children would like. When I had finished I went into the dineing room and ate my dinner. After my dinner I went to bed because I had a head ake and could not stand the children crying. In the morning I woke up and got dressed picked up the plans and went out to work. At my draftsmans desk I phoned up the moudle room I asked them if they could make a mould of the park so I could realy see what it looked like If I could be a disigner when I am twenty fiveI think I would build a park  Words: 164
