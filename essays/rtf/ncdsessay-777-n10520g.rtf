At about twenty five years of age I would get married. I would try to take a job so that I can earn some money. I would take up Motor Racing, and for my Job I would like to be a motor mechanic. I would buy a very good telescope which would have a long range so I can carry on looking at the stars. I would like a home which is in the country with plenty of space. I would occasionally take my wife to a restaurant to dine in the evening, and I would go for plenty of walks. On Sunday mornings I would tinker around with the engine and wash the car. I would go out with my friends and take my wife out in the car. If I would have children I would take them on holidays, and occasionally I would take them abroad. When my children are about eight, I will let them wash the car, and like my father, I would give them some money, the better job they do, the more money they get. I would like a very fast car as I am mad on speeds, if I would have a car I would have any Jaguar, but I won't drive madly on the roads. If I would have work to do I would do it in a study in the house. Even though I am not a keen football fan, very occasionally I might see my favourite team although I am not so sure about it because I do not like the crowds there.When I am twenty five I know I will be a man, and I will be looking forward till then.
