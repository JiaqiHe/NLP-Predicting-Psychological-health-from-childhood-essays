"My name is Mrs [initial]. [surname], I live at [farm name], [town]. I am a vet and I often go away from home to go to the race cource at Wembly to check the horses before they go on the track. I have no children but my husband is a footballer.
We look after lots of horses for other people and we have got quite a few of our own that we breed from. We have got a race horse called ""Saraya"" and a show pony call ""Ajax"". The best horse of them all is a horse called ""Carosel"" who is chesnut with one white foot and a white blaze coming down his face. I teach children to ride and also to by a vets assistant. My husband plays for Lecster City but recantly has not been able to play because he has a bad leg injury which has stopped him from playing. I work at [street name] where I have a surgery of my own. My husband and I live in an old Cornish farmhouse out in the country. We ahve a lovely view from our upstairs window, it is the biew of the Gannal and at High tide it looks butiful. I have just bought a lovely paimino horse which I think I will show next season."  Words: 218
