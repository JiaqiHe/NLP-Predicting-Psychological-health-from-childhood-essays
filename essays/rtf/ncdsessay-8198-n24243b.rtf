I am now 25 years old. I am a mother of two children. My husband goes to work, and I do the cooking and housework in the house. In my spare time I sometimes read a little and draw and paint sometiems. My children are 3 years and 1 year old. In afternoons when I'have nothing to do, I bake a cake. after I got a bit bored at home, I sent the children to a nursery, and set out to find a job. I got a job as a helper at a hairdressers On Saturday morning I sometimes have my hair set, as we sometimes go out on Saturday evenings. Whenever I go out I have to find a babysitter to look after the children, so I don't usuall go out. On Thursday morning, when the children are at nursery.  Words: 141
