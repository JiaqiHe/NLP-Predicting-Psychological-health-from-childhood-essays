I am a nurse in the childerens ward and it is a hard job a lot of the children want to go home and some grumble about the dinner. the hours I work are from 7 'o' clock in the morning to 8 'o clock at night. Some children need the streets changing and some need ingeshons*. At home I have the house to keep clean. and for supper I have chips and peas I still like to look after animals and I have a dog so when I have a day off I go for a ride in the country for picnics and e*jament. It is fun to go for walks in the country to see some things. At work when we have an open day we play and **oux enjoy it. It is hard work as a nurse.  Words: 140
