I am now 25 years old I am an actress. I have been on television a couple of times, for I am on a new programme called Land of the monsters. It is mostely for children. Sometimes on Saturdays I go to a dog show. I show my alstations which win cups they are beauties. I have ten of them nine are show dogs and one is a pet. The new programe what I am now on is on a Sunday afternoon at four o clock. Sometimes I am on films, I know a lot of actreses. Which are on at difrent times. Right now one of my asltations has got pupies. So I am very busy they are about a fortnight old and their eyes are begining to open they are very nice little puppies. Soon they will be strong and healthy, growing little pups.  Words: 146
