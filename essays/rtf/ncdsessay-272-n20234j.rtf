THE PAY HERE IS QUITE REASONABLE, AND I AM QUITE WELL OFF FOR MONEY AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I LIVE IN A COUNCIL HOUSE JUST NEAR TO WHERE I WORK SO I WORK SO I DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR TO GET TO THE STATION, AND TALKING ABOUT TRAVEL I DRIVE A LOTUS ELAN AT OUR TOWN'S RALLY CLUB. I ALSO HAVE A CAR FOR MYSELF, WHICH IS A SUNBEAM ALPINE. I HAVE JUST SET OUR CLUB LAP RECORD AROUND THE TRACK WHICH IS 4.011 MINUTES. BEFORE I WORKED AT THE FILLING STATION I HAD A DIFFERENT JOB ALTOGETHER AS A DOCKER, BUT THERE WAS A STRIKE, AND I HAD TO LOOK AROUND FOR ANOTHER JOB. THAT IS HOW I CAME TO BE AQUAINTED WITH THE DRIVING OF RALLY CARS, AND THE STATION AT HOME, I HAVE SOME QUTE [quiet] HOBBIES SUCH AS:- COIN COLLECTING, STAMP COLLECTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I LIKE GOING CAMPING IN A PLACE CALLED [xxxxxxx], AND I GOT A CLOSE-UP SNAPSHOT OF AN ADDER AND A COUPLE OF BLUE-TITS. IWILL SON BE 26 AND PERHAPS GET ANOTHER PART-TIME JOB.  Words: 219
