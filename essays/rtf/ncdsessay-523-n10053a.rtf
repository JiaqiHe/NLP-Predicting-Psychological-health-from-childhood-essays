I am 25 years old and have dark brown hair, hazel eyes and wear glasses. I lived at 16, [street name], [London suburb], Surrey.
I am a keeper* at London Zoo. I look after two monkeys called Kim and Jim they are very naughty monkeys, and sometimes help with the seals. 
I get their food ready apples, oranges and other fruits. Then I go to Kim and Jim's cage. They are there to meat me. I have a lot of trouble. to keep them in control. They climb all over me me. If they are lucky they find a banana in my pocket.
The seals are very funny there are four of them. and there names are Cheeky, Greedy, Podgy and Sammy.
One day Cheeky came up to the gates. When I was not looking he got out. (I had forgoten to shut it.) It was terrible trying to get him back. we chased* him and at long last he went back*.
I enjoy this Job and I get good pay.
At home I have three guine* pigs called Strip who is a male and Sttripy and Whiskers who are females, and a fish called Spotty.  Words: 191
