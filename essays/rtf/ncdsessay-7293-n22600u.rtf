I am a klener at the post ofice I work three hours aday it is very intresting vecours I like the atmosfer. I am leading a plesent life at home I some times wish that I dident have to do house-work like wosing the clothes, or wash the flors, but still I am great full for a loving home I have. When I come home from work I have to cleen up then I wash the pots when I have done that I sit down for ten minits wirl my feet rest after that I would cook the dinner for twelve o'clock. After we had eaten the meal I would wash up the pots up again, then I would sit down the rest of the afternoon then at night I would be glad to go to sleep.  Words: 137
