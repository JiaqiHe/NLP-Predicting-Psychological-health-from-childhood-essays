I live with my husband, mother, father and child, who is only two and a half years of age. We live in a small village but have lots of friends. My husband works in a farm. I do the cooking, the housework e.t.c. as my mother and father are ill. My mother and father lets me take my son out for walks sometimes. The say I can't be cooked up in the house all day. At the weekends, when my husband is not working, we take mother and father out in their wheelchairs. We never take them into a town as it is very busy. Usually we go somewhere where it is quiet and peaceful. Sometimes I take my son to watch a show or something when he has nothing to do. All our family like pets so we had a dog. He is a beautiful dog. My son called him Breckon after the Brecon Beacons which my husband showed him on a map. We watch television sometimes when there is not much to do. I have knitted my mother a lovely cardigan. The life I am leading is not a very difficult one, although sometimes I am rather busy.  Words: 200
