In fourteen years time I will be twenty-five and be employed by some or other company in a day-time job, but I have no idea what it will be. At night-times after work I will go to places of interest with my friends, and sometimes I would stay at home and watch television or finish some work. I will live by myself in a small house just outside Hull. When the time come for some holidays I will go to places like Australia, New Zealand, Canada I may even go to the moon in a large space craft stopping at a space station on the way back. After working for a company since I was twenty-one I would stop that job and play cricket for Yorkshire and England. as a middle order batsman, and travel the World playing against foreign clubs. In the Winter I would buy a fair sized house in the country side with about ten acres of land, with trees and horeses roaming about, and a windeing river and a water-fall at the end. I will have a maid or someone to look after the house and cook the meals. For transport I would use an E. typ jag and a four seater twin jet pleasure plane to go abroad in in the summer.
