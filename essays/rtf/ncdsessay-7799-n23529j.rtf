I am living with my mother at the moment. My job is a typist I work seven hours a day 9, oclock till four oclock. Then I go home and start to clear up the place for my mother. Then I do any washing of mine that has to be done. And then when all the Jobs are done I patiently wait for my father and mother to come in When I am 26 I will leave home and Amanda and I are going to live in a flat. Now and then I might go to the pictures with my family. My home life is very interesting I do a lot of needlework and my best subject at home is reading or watching the television. If there is nothing on television I help mum in the kitchen, the I would lay the table for dinner (supper.) When the table has been set. I sit down and eat my tea. After every ones finish I gather up the dishes and get them washed up. Then I would get ready to go out with my friends. I going out to buy a few drinks. Then I would go to bed about 10.30.
