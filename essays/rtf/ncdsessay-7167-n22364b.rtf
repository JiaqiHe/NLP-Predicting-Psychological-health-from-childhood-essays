I am Miss **** and I work in a hospital in London as a nurse. At the moment the nurses in my hospital are being kept very busy as we have got quite a few patients who may have to have a heart transplantation. These patients have to be watched very carefully, day and night. I live in a flat in London near the hospital. If I'm spare at the weekends I go and visit my parents who live in the country near ****. 
     Though I'm not married I have a boyfriend called ****. He works in  the army and I hardly ever see him. 
     My cousin works in the same hospital as me and is a sister in the same ward. She is much older than me she became a nurse when I was only thirteen. If I have a lot of spare time I often start painting an oil painting. One of my favorite things is painting. It took three years training to become a nurse. I work in the woments ward. I started of working in the childrens ward. I was moved into the wormens ward because we had an awful lot of patients there and not enough staff. The children all seemed alright with one nurse less so I was told to stay with the women. We have only done two heart transplants in this hospital but it looks as though were are going to do a few more soon. 
     I have done about five small operations before but none were biger than appendics. I enjoy working in a hospital. I like th eother nurses and most of the patients.  Words: 277
