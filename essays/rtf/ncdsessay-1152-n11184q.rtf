I am a batchelor I live in a flat in london I go to work every day as an airline pilot, I pilot a v.c10 at Heathrow airport. I arrive at 8:30 and often do not get home until 1 oclock I have a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow it is murune with white seats. My flat is very simple but full of antiques I have a set of six dining chairs but only one is used. I have a maid who comes in to cook meals and clean up. I do not have much money for the antiques and the rolls cost a very large sum but I like traveling and living in style.  Words: 114
