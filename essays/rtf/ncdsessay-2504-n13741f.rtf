I am now twenty five, I am working in car factory. I am doing very well. I play football in my spare time and doing odd jobs around the house mending things and cleaning up. I have been working for ten years as a car mechanice and I am thinking of becoming a profesenial footballer. I have played football since I was a boy and had wanted to play when I grow up. When I was fifteen I was thinkng of going the collage or University. But I had a letter asking me to work in a factory which I agreed to. I am getting good wages and short holidays. I get my dinner and tea in the canteen we have. I have alot of freinds at home and at work. I go to the cinema once a week I go on holiday once a year for a fortnight, to foriegn countrys. I still live in [town] like I did when I was a boy. It is very quite at home. I go to a football match once a week or more. and I sometimes play cricket when it is too hot to play football. When I get older I hope to be a postman.  Words: 205
