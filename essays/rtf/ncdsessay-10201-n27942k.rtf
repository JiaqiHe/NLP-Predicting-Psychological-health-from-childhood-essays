I am now 25 years old and are still Going to University. When I leave University I hope to be a air-hostess or a teacher. I would like to be a air-hostess because I have been in an airoplane before and thought the air-hostess is very nice and a lot of help. I would like to be a teacher so that I can teach people different things. Or I would like to be a nurse because I would know I was helping somebody. When I am a bit older I might get married and have a baby. but until then I think I will be one of things I have just mentioned. I like going to University and ejoy my work very much.  Words: 123
