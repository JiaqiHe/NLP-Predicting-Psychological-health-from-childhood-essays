I` wish I was a doctor or a police man any one of those or a artist and a football player but the best thing I think I will be is a doctor because my  mother said that i will have to be a doctor or a worker not a worker in the streets picking up papers no that is not the job I want I want a nice job and a good one like my oldest brother he`s got a good job like (place) thats were he goes to (place) and that is the job I am looking for (place), (place), that* were my dad goes Doctor, Police man or a police officer but not going and picking up paper.
But now I have started work I will stay and work, I have got a good job and you gess what it is the job is a doctor don`t you believe it come and have a look thats if I passed.
And I will make the house like gold and the garden like these beautiful flowers and nice red apple trees,
and all so a garge with a nice colours around it as well. I would be a kind man so that every one will know me as a great man I will throw money into the clouds that* if I could reach the clouds I will give people trips on the boat and I will make the world a nice fence around it. Then that the people will make me a king and not a bad king but a good king and make the people happy and gay. 
They will think I am the greatist man on the earth that is if I could aford it.  Words: 285
