Now that I am 25 I'm doing a part time job at a boarding kennels. I work from 10 o'clock in the morning untill 3'o'clock in the afternoon. We have most animals in July and August but you do get some in the spring. At home I have two children, one is two years and the other is 6 monthes. I have been married for four years now and we are living in [town]. I still have a interest in cats and dogs and thats why I have got a job at the kennels. The house we live in is not to big but its big enough for us. We often go to see my mother and farther, who has now retired. At the age of 20 I passed my driving test. It was the third time I had tried. I still go to see my friends who have got married. My cousin has a job at the kennels and that is how I got a job there. My main interest is looking after animals. At home I have 2 dogs, 3 cats and 1 rabbit.  Words: 186
