By the time I'm twenty five I would like to get married. I don't want to have more than three children when I get married. I would like to get a job in a hospital labrotory, because I'm intrested in Sience and Human Biology. I would name my children [female name], [female name] or [female name] if they were girls or [male name], [male name], [male name] if they were boys. I would take my family out at in the countryside as much as possible, I also would like a house in the country. My Children will go to bed at 8.00pm if they are eleven, 8.30pm if they are twelve and 9.00 if they are 13. After they are thirteen they can go to bed when my husband and I do. If either my Mother or my Father dies when I am married I would have either my Mother or my Father at my house to live. I am not going to drink, smoke, take drugs or swear. I would have a 4 bedroomed house with two toilets a bathroom, a kitchen, din**ing room, and a sitting room. None of my children will be spoilt. I will teach my childre to swim by the time they are 7. I am not going to have a big wedding, I shall wear a white dress, I shall invite most of  the teachers at this school, I shall also have a recemption. My children will have birthday partys until they are 14.  Words: 250
