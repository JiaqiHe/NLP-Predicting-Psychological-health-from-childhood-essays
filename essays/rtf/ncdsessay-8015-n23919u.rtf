when I am twenty five I should think I will be married and will be at work (which I hope I will be a hairdresser because I like playing with hair). I should think I would have a young child. about 6 monts old. My interests would be to have a horse and go riding every day. Then when I came home from work. I would get the dinner ready then wash up and do all my jobs when I have time of work so that I can go with my family any-time wanted to go to the sea side or any other place I could go with them. Then in the evening I could go to Bingo or specil classes to do specil things. 
I would like one person to do things for me when I went to work, such* as* a nanna or an auntie to do work when I am at work and to have day's of when I can be at home to do things. 
Then I would let my children go to the public village libary.  Words: 181
