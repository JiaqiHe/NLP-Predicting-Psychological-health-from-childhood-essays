My work is very intresting and I like it very much. I spend my life looking after my hous and my work. then when I have done the work I go out to the cinema and I come back at half past nine. When I get up in the morning I have my breakfast and I carry on with my work. I have to do a lot of things to do in the house. Then I go off to work I do pottery making saucers plates cups dishes. Then I go home at ten past 9 then sometimes at the morning I tkae carl a walk. I go to the park with the baby he his 6 month old.  Words: 119
