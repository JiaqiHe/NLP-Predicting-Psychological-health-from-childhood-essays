When I am twentyfive year's old I would like to be a nurse part time. and work on the fram the rest of the time. I will get mraye when I am twenty one. and have three children. I will work in the house a lot and help on the fram as well. I would like to be a nurse because I like children. I would like to work in a nursing home and look after children. To play with them and help them to do things. But when I have children I will give up work and look after the children that I have. 
When the children get bigger I will go out and work for other people in houses cleaning the house out. I will do this when all the children that I have go to school. and I just come home before they do. and get their tea. for them.
On the fram I will help with the bailing and combining.
At night I will feed the calves pigs and cows sometime's I will milk the cows. I will learn to drive a car when I am about nineteen.  Words: 190
