I am now twenty-five years old and I am still a bacheor. I also have a house in the country by some evergreen trees, it is twenty minuets into town from here. The house that I live in is a buggalow, and also it has a garage though I have not a car but I am hopeing to have one when I am twenty-six. I have had my job for some years, and I hope to have it for some more years. I don't know when I will get married but I to very soon.  Words: 95
