If I were twenty-five years of age, I would married and have two children. I hope one will be a boy, and the other a girl. My little girls name will be Geoanner [Joanna], and my little boys name will be Peter. When my children get old enough to look after themselves I will get a job, I hope to be either a Nurse, or to work in an orphan-age. If I get a job in an orphanage, I will try get a house by it. I hope that I will have a good husband who is a mechanic. If I am a nurse I would try my best to pass tests, I would try my best to help the sick.
