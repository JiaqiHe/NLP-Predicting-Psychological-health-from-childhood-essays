----------------------
I am now 25 years old and I am studying at University, Languages. There are a lot of rowdy people there but I keep clear of them, and their marches. In a couple of years I hope to leave and get a job as an interpretor, or a job where I am not stuck in the same place all the time. In the holidays when I come home I travel up to the North of Scotland with my parents to the peace and quiet of a fishing village for a week or so. I swim a lot and enjoy the fresh air and sometimes I go to [town] to the dancing and meet my friend there. I rise at 7.00 in the morning and take a picnic and walk for miles with my transistor radio on. Sometimes I take a book and sit on the pier and read. Now that I am back at University the things I do are different. Quite often my friends and I go to dances and cafes. Often at the weekends I go home to [town] to see my parents and my niece and nephew, I take them to the cinema and picnics and enjoy myself and then go back refreshed to work. I am engaged but not to be married for a while yet, about 4 years at least.  Words: 225
