I work in a machine shop selling steel materiels I have a wife and three children which do not go to school.
I set off to work at 6 o-clock in the morning and golive* home about 8-o-clock at night. I go to bed very early. We have a very nice home in the country. We have a car and I get xxxx20 for my wages. My wife does not work because of the children but when the go to school she will come and help me in my shop.
Sometimes I go on bussiness to other shops that sell the same materiels as I do. My intrests are in trying to get in the Olympic games next time there is one.  Words: 120
