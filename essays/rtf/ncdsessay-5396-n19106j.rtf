I like aircraft and I work at an airport as a maintanance man I check the aircraft is in good running order I check the radio is working and see that the engines work and that it is properly feuled I see that there is no fault in the tyres or the under carrige if there is I report it and the flight is canceled until the fault is repaired, the work is not boring because something new is often discovered. I live in a houe in the open country near [city] airport. 
I oftern go out in my car to [forest] to see the squirrels that live there. Each day at half past seven I get up and and go to work in my car to be ready to check the plane to take the half past eight flight to spain, the half-past eight flight always goes to spain. The only troble living near an airport is the noise, aircraft go over it every half-hour, coming or going. Some times we hear super-sonic bangs it some times smashes windows and knocks over things. I have a dog which I like very much. It is a great dane and it eats 2lb of meat a day and three hours of exercise.  Words: 211
