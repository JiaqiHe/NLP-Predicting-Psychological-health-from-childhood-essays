The life I am lending is good and I am a married man and my job is a shop owner. We have just got back from our honeymoon in Norich we stayed there for two weeks and while we were there we saw one of my school friends he told us to stay at his house for a week so we did. All the time we were away another one of my friends was looking after the shop and the house until we got back. We had two cars and a moterbicke one of the cars is in the garage getting a new brake peddle and we took the other one on holiday.  Words: 113
