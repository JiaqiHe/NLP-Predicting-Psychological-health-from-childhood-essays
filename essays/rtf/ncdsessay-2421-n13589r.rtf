I am now 25 years old and I am living in a small town. I am an infant teacher in the town's primary school. My home is at the edge of the town and from my home I can have a great view of the country. My main interests is piano playing and singing. I like to cook and knit clothes too. I have already learnt how to play the guitar which I like very much and also I like to sing with it. I an now singing in a pop group and I hope we will be in the charts with our next record. I would like to learn to play the harp and the violin.
      At school I am teaching the children to sing rhymes and tunes. *All the children and the staff are very friendly and I always enjoy teaching It is sometimes difficult to teach the small children but I manage it somehow. I sometimes take my guitar to school and all the children there like to sing with it. At school I sometimes take the other classes for singing and some of the older children play the drums and triangles and other beating instruments.
      On Sunday I go to chapel and I sometimes play the organ there. I take a class at Sunday school. *e*s I am taking the youngest class I tell them stories from the Bible because they can not read. After I've told them a story they colour the pictures in their workbooks. I now enjoy my life very much and I hope to enjoy it always.  Words: 265
