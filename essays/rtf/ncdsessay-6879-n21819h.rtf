I have just left the University at London and I am qualified to become a veterey surgeon. I am working five days a week and I receive good pay. At the week-end I go horse riding and swimming as well as doing some cooking. I work from 9 o'clock to 5.30 pm. I have two assitants to help me when I visit, farms, dogs, and cats homes. There is alway one person at the surgery in case of any accidents. The worse case I have had to deal with is a dog which had fallen down a well and broken its leg. Most cases are when an animal or a bird has caught a disease, or it needs an operation. I am married and I live near my mother and father. I live at 12, [street name]. The surgery is in [street name]. We treat dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, ponies, bugiergars, parrots, myniah birds, tortises, and turipins. We also treat other animals which are not in the list above. The surgery's telephone number is [telephone number]. My telephone number is [telephone number].  Words: 182
