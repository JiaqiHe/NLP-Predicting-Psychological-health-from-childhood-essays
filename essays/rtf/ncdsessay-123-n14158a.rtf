Good job of building houses going to work at 7am coming home at 6pm. Going out on weekends and having a nice big car. To like playing football and cricket. Church on Sunday and after I would invite my feinds [fiche - friends]. At home I would help out on things do repairs help the neibours out. Have a pet dog and parrot and take my work mates out for a drink. At Christmas I will buy mum and dad a new suit and my brothers a pet each. I would not smoke at all but like a pint of beer. At work I would be a brick layer and lay bricks I would bring home a lottle [bottle] of beer for my dad and some for my mum. I am not sure if I still would collect stamps but I know I will still like football. I would most probebly have a nice watch and a small house of my own with electric heating in it. My faviourt things will my pets and looking after them.  Words: 177
