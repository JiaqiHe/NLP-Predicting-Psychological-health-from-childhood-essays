The life I am leading is interesting and aswell it is quite a hard job . The life I lead at home is a quiet and peacful life mostly at home I watch the television. The work I go to is mostly consernd with selling and mending cars . mostly we get carsto mend the usualy means a day or two of hard work. The we might get a car or two sold which is a lot better then mending one . Then of course I go home at night to watch television or sometimes read a part or two of the newspaper. after supper I watch television for a while then go to bed . at six in the morning another hard days work begins in an small garage at the top of the street selling and mending cars. Mostly we sell petrol but that only gets us about forty or fifty pounds. mending cars get us about ninety to a hundred pounds a week . Selling cars gets us about two or one thousand pounds in the week. Mostly we sell parts of cars like the carba*ate or batteries or even a set of plugs . So you see I lead a quiet and peaceful life as a motor macanic in a small garage at the to of the town.  Words: 222
