I live in a big house. It has a big garden at the front. and a small one at the back so the children have room to play. I like taking the children swimming at the weekend. I have two children one at six and one at four. I am a superviser at a big factory and earn quite a good wage. I would not have got the job if I had not had at least one A level. but, I stayed on at school. Every day I take [male name] to school and then go to work. I have a car to make it easyer to go to places. I put ten pounds in the bank every week. Every Saturday I take my wife out.  Words: 126
