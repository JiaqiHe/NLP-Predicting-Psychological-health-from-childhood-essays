When I am 25 years old I hope to have a job. Perhaps I will be a secrutarry. I also hope to be married and have a child. I would like to be quite rich and have a big house. I would like to have a lady that comes in everyday to do some work. I am now a ballroom dancer and when I am 25 I would still like to be a ballroom dancer. I would not like to live in Ruislip (If I am married) because I have always lived there. I may want to live near the sea. If I have any children when they come home from school they would do their homework straight away before anything else. I would do the shopping in the afternoon and do house-work in the morning I would like to go out on Saturday's or Sunday's. On a Sunday I might go on a day trip to the seaside with my children and husband. When I am at work I would like to type letters for my boss or write them out in shorthand. When I go on holiday I would like to go abroad. Perhaps I would go to France or Spain for my holidays. I would go in August when it is verry hot there. I would like my house to be fashonable. Every room decorated and wallpapered with pretty paper, and with carpets.  Words: 236
