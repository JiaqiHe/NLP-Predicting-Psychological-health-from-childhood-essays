I have one very good job which is being a radio man, I get up every morning at 7.00, have for breakfast, listen to the news and drive off in my mon* to help at [name] radio shop. Another good job is to go out and play the piano. Somtimes Dad comes out with me and plays somthing else. I do one more job I go to fates and disqutecs with my kit. In my kit I have a turntable, loudspeakers, microphone and an amplifier ""not forgetting a few records."" I live in a small house on my own. I fix up my own things I fixed some shelves to the wall, Ive fixed up my own television and wireless ariels and some speakers around the house. I go to church and smoke about five cigaretes a day. On Saturday's I sit down and watch the television, eating sweets two in one hour. Every night I read a book before I go to bed and after 15 minutes I switch off the light and go to bed."
