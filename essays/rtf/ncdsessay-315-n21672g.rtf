I lived with my husband in a cottage. I was what I had always wanted be, a hair-dress. I left our house for the quarter to nine train. When I finally got to the ticket office I heard a train pulling in. I got my ticket and told hurry to keep the change. Soon I reached the stop but found I was ten minutes late. My first appointment was just arriving takeing a seat beside the bassin. I seemed to have alot to do but now it came to lunch time. I was glad to sit down and have something to eat. All good times have to come to an end and soon I heard the first customer arriving. Soon the shop was crowded with children and screaming people. I felt dreadful, my head was spinning. I felt I must go home. I left and took the bus home. When I reached home I went straight to a chair. I rested then got out my knitting. It was a jumper for Jorn my husband. The door-bell rand in was Jorn. I asked him why he was so early but he said I must have fell asleep. Next day was Sunday. I took my horse, jip, for a ride. Hours past before I reached home again.
