I would like to be a cook at a hotel and have a house of my own. I get up early in the morning to make the guests breakfast, their lunch and tea. When I am on holiday i go away until I am due to go back to the hotel. I would like to live in the country-side but I would have a long way to travel because there is not a hotel there. My children goes to school near wherewelive. When I go home in the evening I have to look after my mother. I have to make three meals a day for all the guests and go home and make my mothers meals. I like working as a cook. We get a holiday at Christmas time. I have up stairs in my house and a garden for the children to play in.  Words: 145
