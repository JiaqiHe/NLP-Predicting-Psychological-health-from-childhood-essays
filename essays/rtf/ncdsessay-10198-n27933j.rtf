I enjoy my work as a secatary. I am typing letters all the time. I earn enough money. I like cooking meals which is interesting even though they dont allways turn out right. Doing housework half the day, is sometimes tiring. In my spare time at the week-ends I enjoy horse riding along country lanes. I enjoy reading in my spare time which interests me. I also look ager my pet animals which is interesting. Making and sewing some of my clothes interests me, knitting jumpers and cardigans. I like painting and drawing pictures is interesting to me, which I hope to become an artist. I like nature, seeing hour plants grow and collecting interesting things. I like traveling to foreign countrys and learning about them.  Words: 126
