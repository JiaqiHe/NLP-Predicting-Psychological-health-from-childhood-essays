I imagine that I was a gardener working up the garden every day I would work at home as well on Sundays I would do work in my Bungerlow I would make a cabbernet to go up in the kitchen in the week I would work up in the garden planting vegetaballs in the garden and planting flowes and plants in the garden priking out plants in the greenhouse I would plant tomattoes and lettice and cuccumbers in the greenhoueses and before I will plant them I would pant the the greenhouse and a cuple of days later I would make show that the paint is dry then I would put all the things back in the greenhouse. I would live a happy life being a gardener working up somboy eleses garden. Sometimes I would have a rest on a Sunday. On Saturday afternoon I would watch would of Sport. In the morning I would be working up the Garden.  Words: 160
