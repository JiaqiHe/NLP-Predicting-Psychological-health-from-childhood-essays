I am now married and have two children I have made a lot of electrical things like radios recordplayers and things like that. In my room, down stairs where I make all these things there are alot of electrical things left over and there all my aeroplane's the can fly all over the wall and a few glider's. I often go fishing alot and take my boy of five year's old with me because he seem's intrested in it and he also like's football and so do I. I belong to a firm that makes computer's for America's Apoolo Jupiter shots these computers are the ones that register the readings of how fast the ships going the weight and things like that. At the moment ** ** as a making a computer that will do most of the work for the men when this is finished and if it work's it will make our journy to saturn a lot easier. When I have any spare money I normally spend it on transistor's* or resistors otherwise I will spend it on gliders or motor plane's. I dont wear any specal sort of clothes gust as shirt tie trousers and jaket to match. I do not waist my money on clothes like some people do in this day and age at 1983.  Words: 220
