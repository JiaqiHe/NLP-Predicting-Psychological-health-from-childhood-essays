I now help my father at his garage, I work with my father and my Uncle [name]. I do taxi jobs, changing tyres and mending punctures and other things that go wrong with cars. Sometimes I do welding and that is not alway's on cars, lorries or vans. The petrol is a lot dearer than it used to be and the taxi jobs cost about two shillings, per mile, per person. I do a lot of writing in, the books which we keep a record of the jobs we do, and of the prices. We have two pits in the garage, which I think are safer than jacks and lifts. The pits are so you can get under-neath the car with out having to lie on your back and you are also in a position where you can move about more freely. I am also a part time fire-man which some times is a bit of a nuisance for my home life. But it is better to give my help there.  Words: 171
