I am now twenty five years old, sometimes I wish that I was still at school but sometimes I don't. I have two baby's boy and a girl theyare twins and it is hard work at times. My husband is a school teacher at a Junior school for boys and girls he gets a good wage and we are saving up to buy a car and a house of our own. I have got my name down for a part time job, for when our children grow up and then I will most likely be able* to get them in a nursery if their names are put down. When the twins are asleep I am glad because I can get some house work done. Before I had the twins I used to bake alot I liked baking but I ame not interested in it much now. The worst part about having twins is when they are yound but I wouldn't part with them. I also like cooking but recently some meals have been burnt. Before I married and just after I worked in a hairdressing salon called the Wavely. It is the beggining of summer now and we are going on our holidays. This year we decided to go to [town] on a caravan sight called [location] I am hoping that we will have a good time like we usually do. The twins are old enough now to sit up and we will beable to take them for walks to pubs which you can sit outside and have your drinks on tables. They enjoy it best of all when they are on the beach. The twins are learning to walk holding on to furniture and me and my husband are usually quarrelling.  Words: 292
