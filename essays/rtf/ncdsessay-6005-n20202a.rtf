When I was 25 I was working at a garage. I was one of the top engineer's, it was a very difficult job for some people. At this age I was leading a nice life. I would nearly go to the stock car races every Sunday, because some driver might ask me to fix his engine or change a wheel or something like that. I had a lot of hobbies, my most favorite hobbie was football. I played for Albion Rovers who's ground was not far from my house. I was married and had one child, my wife worked at a hair stylists. The only child we had was a boy and his name was Peter he had only just turned four. My wife was only 23 and she was an exerlent cook as well as hair dresser. One of my best friends was [male name] [surname] he was working at the same garage and played for the same football team as me, he was only a few months older than me. His wife worked at a florist's shop she had a taste for flowers. We* got a car as soon as we were married it was a present from the whole famiely. We liked Australia so much we went to there for a month. Our child did not go with us when we went because he was only one and a half at the time. We may even decide to live there and take the baby as well my wife thinks it will be better for me if we do. Some how we have got to raise the money before we can go I hope we can. Because it was nice when we went on our holidays.  Words: 288
