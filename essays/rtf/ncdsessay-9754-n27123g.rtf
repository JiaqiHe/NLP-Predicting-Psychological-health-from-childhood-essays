I work at a hairdresses. In my spare time I like to go to the pictures or watch the television. I live with my parents. My freind and I usualy go out every nigtht either to the pictures. or to the local skating rink. I like my work and I dont think that I would like to change it. At home in my spare time I like doing my mums hair or listening to records. In september myself my parents and my freind are going abroad. to Italy, I have one brother who is married, he lives in a flat on a councile estate. On saterday afternoon I work at boots the chemists in town. I leave o* at 4.30 which gives me plenty of time to do some shopping. I usualy get home about six fifteen. When Ive had my tea I do my hair have a bath and then go to call for my friend. On a sunday morning I take driving lessons. Sometimes I go out with my parents in the afternoon and if its warm enough we take our tea with us. Then on monday morning back to work.  Words: 193
