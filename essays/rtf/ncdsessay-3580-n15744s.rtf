I like to be a footballer and play for a first division team, and go to wembly. I would like to be centre forward. And I would get married and stay in [town] for about seven years and move to some other place, at home I would stay at home for about, when I am twenty* six then I will go and get a house of my own, and have a family of my own. Then if I play for a first team like Leeds*, we will get a house there. In the week I will get a job like in a office, and work till I have got alot of money, And give some to my mum and dad each week  Words: 122
