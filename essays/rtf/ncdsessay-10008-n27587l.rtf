When I am 25 years old I will probely be staying at the same home. Then when I feel like it for sure I will get a job at the same factory as my father because my father is a welder and he welds bits and pieces of metal together in case they have a hole and I would like to be a welder as well as my father but my father said he might leave that job and factory and go to another factory where he can get some more overtime when he is on day shift but I hope if he is going to a new factory that he gets a Job as a welder so I can help him weld pieces of metal together and or when he gets two or three days off from work I help him with the car. The last time I helped him* I We had to take the whole of the gear box out to see what was wrong with it. Just recently my Dad made some ramps so he could drive his car up the ramps So you could get underneath the car car more easy.  Words: 196
