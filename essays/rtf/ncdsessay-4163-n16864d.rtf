I am working in a school where most of the children won't do as they're told, but it is really good fun. The other teachers are very friendly. My house is at Kilmarnock it is very nicely fitted and central heating. My hobbies are reading and handcraft. Housework is not difficult. Friends are easy to make. But coming home from work and have to make the supper is very tiring after working all day long. After supper I get a rest and get my feet up. About 8 o'clock we've got to get the baby and [female name] ready for bed. The have a nice cup of tea and go to bed. My interests about my life now is very interesting and exciting. I can go about the places I have never been before and enjoy myself make new friends meet new people. Be able to take care of people and children. Life is more colourfull than when I were a child everywhere is nice and bright. You are in a new world* and enjoying life.  Words: 176
