I am 25 and in the navy first we had to train we go home every month for the weekend. We sail wood* to other conterys. we come home wich other goods then we get our money for ourself it is good to be home for we can rest there. At sea you can look at other ships go up and down in rough*. Once the fire bell went everybody went up on deck and instead of going to the fire we stood on the deck waching a ship fighting the sea it looked like the ship would go down. The captain and the crew had put the fire out in the bakery. We all got punished in the end. The ship sprang a like when the admital was abord. For a bit of fun called man overboard. The man had to mend the hob& alone. We were home for Ester.  Words: 151
