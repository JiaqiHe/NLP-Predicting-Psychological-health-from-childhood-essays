Iam twenty five and I am in the airforce. In my spare time I draw and invent my own planes and some of them are made. When I am off duty or on leave I would go to a gliding club, or go to a yuaghting club. I would get a job as a passenger plane piolot. And if I have inough money I would own a riding school or a school to lern* people to drive. I would earn about ten thousand pounds a year. I would put most of my money in the bank and would save it up for odd things that might need doing round the house like building a greenhouse or putting an excursion on the house or putting an excursion on my garden. I might even have to by a little log cabin in the country so I could go out there to have a rest or by a bigger car or if I cant get a log cabin I would try and get a little farm in the country. And if I can't get that I would get a cottage in the country.  Words: 190
