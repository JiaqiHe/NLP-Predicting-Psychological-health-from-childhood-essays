I am a teacher, I take the class 4A. Every Tuesday morning we have art. Art was one of my best subjects when I was at school, and still is. My home life is dull sometimes because of all the marking of the test papers and books. I still watch television alot but some times I go out with a friend or one of the teachers at school. I have a car so I can go out when I want. My interests are painting, mostly of animals like swans and ducks and also horses, sometimes I paint people or buildings. Then every Tuesday night I have to fetch the sewing home which 4A and 4B have done. Or cut out some pattens. And tonight I have had to fetch a maths test paper home so I'll have to work out the answers. The life I am leading is a very excited* one we go on trips with the school.
