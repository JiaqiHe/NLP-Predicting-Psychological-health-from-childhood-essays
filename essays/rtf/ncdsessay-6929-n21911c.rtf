"      I run a small car, a small house, and I am a bachelor, just left university. I am an actor, and I have got alot of hard work. I studied like mad at university, for it was hard work, and I was lucky I got the job. There are a few things I am interested in, music, cars and football included. I play football in my spare time, and I enjoy everything.
      I cannot say weather an actors life is good or bad. I enjoy my parts, I like the people. you become famous and that is good, but there is one problem, privacy! When I am going down the street, shopping, people stop you, saying: ""Could you give me your autograph?"" Then soon there are people crowding round you saying the same thing! So there are alot of things that happen to a chap of my kind of proffesion.
      I enjoy life at home, a nice, quiet, peaceful spot in the country, where there is no noise at all, except the odd veichcle now and then going past. But it is always nice to have friends come to see me who live quite far away from me.
      I enjoy cooking as a pastime, and I sometimes make cake and sometimes shortbread and things like that."  Words: 217
