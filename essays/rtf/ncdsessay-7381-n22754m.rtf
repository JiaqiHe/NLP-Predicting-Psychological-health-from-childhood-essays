I have got a diploma in Music and am in an ochestra in the first violins. We are to tour round the world in a few months but am enjoying my home life where every one is suprised that I am in the orchestra. I am married to one of the trumpeters, who was at college with me. We have one child she is two and is going to stay with my mother while we are away. My main interest is music but I like to write little stories now and again. When I am not playing in the orchestra I spend lots of my time with [female name], our small daughter. I sometimes take her shopping with me and get her a little present as I am not with her as much as I would like to be.
After a few years I would like to give up my place in the orchestra and play for fun. I would then become a normal housewife and be with [female name] most of the time and behave like a proper mother!
My life is full of music, [male name] (my husband) and [female name]. I am sometimes glad I have things to do, but sometimes I would prefer to leave everything to someone else.  Words: 211
