----------------------
I am married and I have a little boy his name is [male name]. My husband goes to work, he works at an office and we live in [London suburb]. [male name] is three years old. I was married when I was 21 years old and my husband is now 26 years old and he was married to me when he was 22 years old. We live in a house and our garden is not very long but it is quite wide. At the back there is a rockery, at both sides there are flowers with a fairly wide lawn. Near the rockery there is a baby oak tree with grass growing around it. On the right hand side there is a path that leads up to the rockery and the apple tree. At the back of the house in the dinning room we have french windows. It also has three bedrooms. I like ironing and like watching television if the programmes are good. If the television programmes are not very good I like reading the paper or doing crosswords. I am not keen on going shopping but it is O.K. Cooking is all right, it usually depends what I cook. I sometimes like making dresses.  Words: 206
