"I am twenty-five years of age. I am married and I have a job as a journalist. I earn good money at xxxx75 a week have two pet dogs. One is a D*lachshund and the other a dalmation. I have a car, and the make is a Corsair, it it light blue. Yesterday I went to write a story about a murder in Sussex. I got home late last night. Last week I went up to Scotland about an important suicide case. The man had thrown himself off the top of a cliff into the sea. I am also a part-time stamp dealer. My most valuable collection is a sheet of rare penny balcks worth xxxx75 each and I have got a hundred of them. I have'nt my children * but my wife, Tina, is expecting a baby in four months. I also play football for an amateur club called **** who are third in the Southern Premier league. The phone rant about an hour ago and my wife answered it. The person who rang was Mike and his wife Cheryl wanting us to go to a party tonight at 8'o clock p.m. My wife said she vould'nt promise anything because I might be called out on a business trip. My dogs' names are ""Dinky"" the Dachshund and ""Blotto"" the Dalmation. Sometimes I wish I had never started this journalists job but at least it pays good money and my stamps help quite a lot too."  Words: 246
