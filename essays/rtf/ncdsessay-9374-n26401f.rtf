I have an interest of drawing, now and then I sit down and draw cartoons and all different veiws of things like houses, boxes chairs etc. but I am mostly interested in drawing portrates I earn a few pounds on the goods ones but some of them just tern our horribe. When I am at home I do things like painting pictures, decorating, digging the garden read ing books and again copying cartoons out of books and the paper. Sometimes just sit up stair in my bed room and watching the birds and hills through a pair of binoculars.
