I work at a nusery and enjoy it very much. At home I get in just in time for my daughter who comes home from school at quarter to four. She is 10 years of age and very good at School work. My home is very bright and inviting. when I am on holiday I am never lonley becase there is all-ways plenty to do. I don't go out very often becase I don't think marride women ought to. But its all wright if you go and see yore frends for the night and have some-one baby site. When I have fineshed my house work I go out for works even is its raining. In my spare time I write scaring storeys. But nearly most of the time I like to wrrite fairy storey's to read my daughter before she goes to bed.  Words: 143
