I am twenty five years old, and I had been at my father's factory for five years. I was enjoying the job. We made bricks and tiles. First we Collect some clay from the Quarry in a lorry then it is taken to the works where it is grinded till it is like sand then we mix it with water and it comes out the same shape as a brick but much longer. Then they cut the bricks and put them in the kilns. Then in the cooling place.
      It takes one month to make a Brick. But of course we sell the bricks by thousands. I am in charge of the cooling of the bricks.
      On saturdays I come home at one o'clock and in the evenings I usually go out for a dance and meal. On the week-days I go and buy some fish and chips for we have a super fish and chip shop near us. 
      In the afernoon sometimes go and watch a foot ball match. Which is generally very good. I am very intrested in soccer and Collect anything to do with it. I already have pictures of all the first Diversion teams. I support [football club]. Sometimes I go out with my friends to [town] on our bicycles.
      We have Quite a good life. In the evening I sometimes watch television.
      Sometimes their are some very programms.  Words: 234
