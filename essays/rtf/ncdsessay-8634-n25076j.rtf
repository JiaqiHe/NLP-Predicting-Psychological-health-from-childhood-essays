At the age of 25 I would be in a job as a teacher or looking for a job as a teacher depending on if I went to a University or not. At home I would books and things. My day would begin by rising about 7 O'clock have a small breakfast and then clearing up. After school I would read or go out. or T.V. 
I would like my house to be outside the main part of the time. In 25 years time, I think that people will be going to the moon by a space train but not on rails. I think I would like to go to the moon. I would spend some time up there and then I would like to teach about the moon at my school. I don't think I would be married but would be thinking about it. I think that the schooling ways would have changed a lot and it would be much easyer to teach.
I would try to keep up with the modern ways and not be old fashioned, I would take an intrest with the boys I teach inside and outside of school as much as I could and get to be freiendly with their parents.  Words: 206
