When I get my Job as an hair-dresser or swimming instructer, librarian or book writer or even be a teacher. but I will never want to be house wife because of all the floors to clean and the carpets to sweep.
If I am a hair-dresser I will for about 8 or 9 years and by then I hope to have my own shop but if I get my Job as an swimming instructor I will teach the children how to swim and watch over them and if not I want to be serving* in the cafe. If I am a libriain I will tidy the books uo in the shelf or stamp the books. To be a book writer I wil have to go to collage for about two whole years I want my books to be in an library and in book stores.  Words: 144
