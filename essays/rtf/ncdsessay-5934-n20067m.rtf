If I were rich I would have a car a nice house and a dog. I would be a hair-dresser and I go out about three times a week. To the shops or the Pictures and by lots of new summer and winter dresses and suits I would have a couple trouser* suits and bellbottoms trousers and a white frilly blouse and a black waistcoat and black knee high boots. I would like to have a nice big bedroom and a big bear* to sit on the end of my bed* and a scicodelic room with one white wall and a white lamp shade. and my dog would be a Afcanhound*.  Words: 111
