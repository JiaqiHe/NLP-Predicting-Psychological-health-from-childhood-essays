I am leading a happy life, I have 2 children, ones a girl and ones a boy. We have a big house with a garage. I have a good job it pays well. I am a nursery teacher, I love little children. My husband has a good job as a maneger and is very buisy. When I have the charnce I will try for a better job for more money, andso to get a better house. I go down my mothers every weekend, and when I have a, spare moment in the week. at night we go to bed early and so to get a better start in the mornings. The children have just started school. 
I go to work at Ten oclock untill, twelve. Then I come home to cook the children a meal. We have a snak at dinner and have a big meal at night, Then I pack the children off to school again. At three I go back to work untill four, then I come home. I like to get the children to bed early and so we have a talk down stairs, When I have a chance I would like to find a riding school for the children, I love horses and so do the children.
