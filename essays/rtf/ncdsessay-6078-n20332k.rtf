Now I am twenty five I can almost do anthing I like. For instance I am now renting my own flat in London and I am working in one of Englands most profitable office. Tonight I am going to a 21st birthday party. One of my favorite things to do is to go dancing in Whitehall. Last year I went to Majorca for a holiday and I went home at Christmas. My parents dont agree to my living away from home and visiting them only on special occasions like Cristmas and Easter but, I write them long letters to stop them worry-ing so much.
I have a friend called [female name] who is engadged. She is one year older than me but we are great friends and often go out to-gether, to places such as, Dance halls, Ice Rinks and Bowling alleys. I'm not very good at bowling but we have so much fun. I write quite a few poems and stories but none of them get printed.  Words: 167
