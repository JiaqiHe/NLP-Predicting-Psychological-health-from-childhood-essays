If I were twenty five I would marry and have some children. I would have some pets and ride. I would send my children to school and do the house work, do some cooking and flower arranging & shopping. I would have a large house in the country with lots of ground for ponies and some garden. My husband would go to work in [city] and earn some money. My garden would have tulips, roses, lupins and a fruit cage with blackberries, raspberries, blackcurrants and loganberries. I would have a nice swimming pool with a diving board and a tennis court. I would have a rope at one end of the garden and a sand pit for long Jump and high jump. My house would have six bedrooms and two bath rooms up stairs and a large play room with a table tennis table in it a kitchen a drawing room a dining room down stairs.  Words: 156
