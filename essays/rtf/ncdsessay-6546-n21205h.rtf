I got married when I was twenty one years old. When I was twenty three I had a little girl we called her Jane. She has got fair hair like my husband and I. She is two years old now and in the afternoon she goes to nursery for a couple of hours while I go to the art studio where I love to paint. I like to disign patterns for wall papper. At four o'clock I callect. Jane from the nursery she always seems glad to see me we catch the bus home, we live in a very nice bungalow in ****. My husband des*gned the bungalow himself that is his job. He dosent get home from work untill 7 o'clock. But I give Jane her tea before he comes home. I let her stay up till seven so that she can say good night to her daddy then she goes to bed. We belong to a tenis club so every saturday we go to play tenis. Every sunday we go to tea at my mothers and farthers Jane loves them. In the morning Jane wakes about half past ten and by then most of the house work is done. When I have dressed and fed her we go to the shops. My husband does not come home for dinner. On tuesday night I go to sewing class. 
When we were married we dicidided to stay at **** because we liked it here. We often go swimming and take Jane with us.  Words: 253
