"My job is a hairdresser and my work is pretty hard, I get plenty of money a week and enjoy doing it. I have a brother who is just a year older than I am he is twentysix and I am twentyfive. At home I like to pass my time away by doing pusles, at the moment I am doing one with four hundred peices in and it is called, ""Old Masters"", I am also doing driving lessons and I go nearly every night which also helps me to fill my time in. I do thinck I am leading a very good life and sometimes go out with my freinds. One day a lady came in and said that she wanted her hair done up in ringlats so she could go to a party. When I had finished, it realy sooted her but she said it was not done right so I hat to do it again, I did this five times and the fifth time she said that she would put that finishing touch to it as she called it. When I gave her the change she started to complain about how long it took to do a simple thing as that and she told the manager, so, the manager asked me why it took me so long so I told him all about the lady in the shop, he understood and told me to go on with my work and if I had any more trouble with people report them to him and he will look after them for us, so if anone wants to become a hairdresser keep an eye on the people who confuse you because they can get you into trouble. When I was eleven years old I used to go to a school called [school] and if I could have I would have stayed there and I didn't want to leave the next school and go to a job but I was to eger to get a job as a hairdresser."
