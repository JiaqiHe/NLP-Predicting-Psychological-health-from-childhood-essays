My day job is working as a engineire at a navil training base, my father is dead and my mother is very ill, we've got a bit of land where I keep some cattle. There as been three wars I was on the swiss frontery. when I was shot through the arm. Then I went in hospital and had a operation on my arm. I've left the training base and gone into binness and an other child and now it is my birthday again.  Words: 118
