I have just came out of a college. I was taking music because I enjoy it and I play the three instruments-: recorder, piano, violin in my spare time . 
I hope to become a music teacher or something that asscosiates with it. My other ambition was to become a teacher, a primary one .
Just now I am staying with my parents until I get a flat or somewhere to live. I like watching television, and I like playing tennis . 
My music teacher was (name). I started taking lots at about 9 years of age.  Words: 96
