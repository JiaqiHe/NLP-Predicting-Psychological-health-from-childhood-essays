I would get married and do the house keeping, and my man would work and bring in about 15 to 20xxxx a week. We would go to the picttures, and after that we would go and visit some friends , or visit my mum and dad, sometims we would buy sweets and watch the teleivision. And if my man got hurt and he would have to go to hospital, I would go out to work and stay with my mum and dad , and go into see him sometimes, and when he was better and had to go to work , but he had to go into a highter job and only get about 10xxxx I would go out to work. And if suddenly I took ill and he was good at helping I would tell that I wanted something to eat he would bring it up to me and then bring the television up, for me and I would tell him to do the work and if I feel better I would give him money, to go and buy some ice cream for us, And then when I get better I would go to another job and if he is all right and could go to another job, with good money we would be very pleased and I would help my mum and dad if the needed anything, and we would be very happy and if anything should worry us let it passed and forget anything had even happend but I hope we would be pleased.
