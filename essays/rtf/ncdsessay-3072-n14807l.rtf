Every day of the week from Monday to Friday I go to work I work in a dress makers shop, every day you meet new people and make new dresses. All the women who work with me we all wear the same clothes, a blue dress with a white coller. 
I live in a flat which has four rooms as bedroom, a dining room, a bath room and a kitchen. Some nights I invite people home for tea.
All though I am not married I do have a boy freind who I go out with at the weekends. We write each other lots of letters. Apart from these letters which he writes I do not get many.
