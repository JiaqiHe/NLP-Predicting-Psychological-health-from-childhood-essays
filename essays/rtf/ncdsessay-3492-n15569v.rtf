In the morning I would get breakfast ready, eat it, then wash and dry dishes. Make beds, dust and tidy the rooms and do some shopping. When I come home I would put my shopping in the right places (such as butter in larder) and then start to get the dinner ready. After eating my dinner I would wash and dry dishes. I would then do some washing. I would sit down and read papers an magazines and bookes. I would get tea ready eat it, put wash and dry dishes and then watch television. After watching television I would have some supper and clean dishes. I would wash and go to bed. If I had children I would dress them in the morning and undress them at night. I would buy games for playing in and out of doors.  Words: 140
