I would be a teacher and I would go with the army. I would enjoy going to other countrys because I could see alot of interesting things in my spare time. If we went to Africa I would see the wild animals and the different sort of people. I would have to learn alot of languages. The children would be different to the children in this country but it would be nice to get to know them. The food would be different also but I would think I would enjoy most of it. The warm countrys would be the best to go to. If I had the choice of a country to go to I would choose Italy. If I did go there I would be able to see Rome and Venice. I would be able to come home in the holidays to see my father and mother and my friends. When I had retired I would come back to Wales for the rest of my life.  Words: 167
