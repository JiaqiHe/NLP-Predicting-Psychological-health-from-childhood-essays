When I was 25 years old, I had just been cleaning the house when I felt very funny. It was the funny feeling you had when you were having a bad day. I rang my husband at work and he phoned the hospital. When I had got home again with my bady*, I gave my husband [male name], the bady while I got into bed. [male name] gave me back the bady and then he brought me a cup of tea and some toast. That night I had no sleep at all so I slept all the day long and was wide awake at night so my bady would go to sleep. When anyone came in the day time he screamed like a cat chased by a bull. When my husband came home I asked him if he like the name [male name] he said he did, so the bady was called [male name]. When [male name] went to see if [male name] was coming, he came in with a cat which was his very own, so we got the basket out and put the cat in it and gave him a saucer of milk and some fish. The cat smelt the fish and scmpered round the room, to make [male name] laugh untill he went to sleep.  Words: 218
