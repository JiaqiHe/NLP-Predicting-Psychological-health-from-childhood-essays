If I was 25 now I would probably have a wife and children. I would like to travel around the world to see all the other people and study their habits and how they make things. Or if I could not do that, I would like to go on a lot of holiday's and have no worries. If I had not had what I wanted I would work hard and get a lot of money for my wife. It would be great to explor the mountain's and go to the thick jungle's, and sail on the amazon and all my other intrests are to go out on my own and not to be bothered by anyone. If I was to leave school I would probably go straight to work and save money to buy a house, I would make the house different and I would keep on changing it for I like different scenes. I would like to have a quite big home and room to move in I dont like a small house you cant really move in it, I would like to have two or three children I would not know what their names I would leave it to my wife and I would like one girl. and one boy I would like a big sitting room and four chairs.
