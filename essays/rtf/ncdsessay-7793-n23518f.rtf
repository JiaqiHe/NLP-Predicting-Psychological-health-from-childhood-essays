Today on the menu is stake for the officers with potatoes and peas. and for the Chief Petty Officer beef curry and boiled rice. The cadets just have liver and potatoe. The officer has juse told me to serve the officers so I am know walking along the corridor with the trolley. I gave the trolley to the chief stewart and he took it in the dinining room for the officers. I served the cadets and the RearAdmril but he said his stake was not done enoth for him so I went back and brought him a nother piece.
