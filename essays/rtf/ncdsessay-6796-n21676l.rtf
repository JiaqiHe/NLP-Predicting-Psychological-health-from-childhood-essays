I am a showjumper now and also I have lots of pets and animals which need looking after. Every morning I take the horses out for exerciseing. When I come back I clean out the stables and groom and feed them. When I have finished that I have my own breakfast. At half past eight I go into the kennals and get shadow, bob, lassie and candy. Those are my dogs they are collies and very well trained. I take them for walks over the comon where I take the horses sometimes After that I feed them and brush them and let them run about in the padick field where sometimes I let the horses run. My next job is to feed Elsa and Kind the lions. Elsa and King are very friendly but very mischefvish. I keep them out in the back of the stables when I am out so they wont tair the place down. I am very rish but not a million-air I have ernt all my money I work at the R.S.P.C.A and get alot of money for it so I can aford to buy a small swimming pool for a dolphin with a spilt tail. I enjoy working at the R.S.P.C.A. and fill very sorry for all the birds that die because they are covered in oil. I fill sorry for every animal which is in pain. I would like very much to stop the killing of baby seals I think there is know need for it, the men who kill them wouldn't like it if some big seal came a long and kill them.  Words: 270
