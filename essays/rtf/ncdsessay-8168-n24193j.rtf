My interests will be I think be football, cricket and other games on the television. I might get married. I think I might work in a factory or office. The job will have to have a good wage. Not to far away. I will buy a car I think I will have a smallish one like a mini. If there was a cottage or bungalow near to work I might buy it if it was in my price range. At home I will stay for a bit before buying a house of my own until I have a full time job. At weekends I might do odd jobs at home. On Sundays I might go to church in the afternoon I would visit my gran and grandad. On some saturydays I might go and watch a football match or might do something in the garden at my parents house or if the house had a garden wich I bought I might do that it would have to be small. But if it was large I would buy a rotavater and a lawn mower. Some nights I might go to the pub or to clubs. I might also visit friends and relations. I wouldn't live in a town because of the noise or near a busy road or railway line or an airport or docks In summer I would go for a week or two holiday. I would go farther from Isle of man or Isle of wight. I would drive there myself. I would stay in a caravan.  Words: 258
