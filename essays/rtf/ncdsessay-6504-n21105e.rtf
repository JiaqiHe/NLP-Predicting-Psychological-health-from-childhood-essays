When I am twenty five I hope I will be playing for a football team. Or at (T) the olimpic games if I am not one of these I will want to be a police man. I am interested in breeding rabbits in my spare time a going for runs to keep me fit. I am interested in swimming* I hope I will have my gold medal by then. I like to go swimming in the sea. I also like (skind) sky* diving in my spare time one day I will try to swim the british channel. I am interested in sport and in cars. I (lif) live at home with my mother and father. My work is a police officer I am the officer that attends murders. When I come home at night I have a hot meal then I got to bed I am up early every morning I have my breakfast* then I go for a mile run but sometimes I go for a mile ride* on my bycicle sometimes I go for a swim in the river sometimes I do nothing just go to the station. When I am at work I* have plenty to do but when there is a day with no murders I get board in one reason I like to go in to a murder case but when I am in a bad mood everybody safers. Sometimes we never catch up with the criminal but most times we do. The criminal might give himself in he even might try to kill one of the detectives if he does that he gets tret bad by the rest of the squad if he kills an officer he will be put in jail for the rest of his life. There is a gang of criminals with guns (a) we have to take guns and surround them our guns are fake though  Words: 316
