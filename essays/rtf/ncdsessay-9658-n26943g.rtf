I would try to improve my golf score. But going back to science I would like to work in a labritory miksing chemicals and useing a microscope. I would like to have a car and be able to drive it. When I am twenty five their maybe people living on the moon and people will be going on trips to the moon instead of abroad. Their mabey hovercraft trips and the concord will be in full use from Britain to America across the Atlantic. Decimals should be in use by that time to. But there are things I would not like to change. There might be people living in Antarctica. I would like to be a better swimemr.
