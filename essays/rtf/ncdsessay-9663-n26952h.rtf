"My wife goes to town every Wednesday, but on the rest of the week she works at a Boutique, which she owns. My children, [female name], aged 2, and [male name]-[male name], Aged 8 1/2, are as sensible as my wife, although only [male name]-[male name] looks like her, I always said that [female name] resembeled me.
I still like reading, which was my greatest hobby in my childhood, and [male name]-[male name] is a little book-worm too! [female name], my wife, wishes that I'd do some weeding, for a change. ""Well,"" I said to her, ""I'll think about it."" Recently, little [female name] has been learning words, such as; ""Mamma, Dadda, Bruvver, [male name],"" and, with a great effort, ""[male name]."" I think I can say she is learning quite well.
It's not surprising what my job is, I'm a reporter, The Daily Hereford Express, that's the newspaper, well, lets not say Reporter, Journalist is more like it.
It was only last week I got that great exclusive on the Concorde crash.
