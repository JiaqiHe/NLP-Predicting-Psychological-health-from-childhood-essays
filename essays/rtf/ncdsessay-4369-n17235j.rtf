I am an acitect and I enjoy my work very much I make a good living and I have a good house in the country near to is a trout and salmon fishing river, about 5-o-clock every night I would go down to the river and fish till about 7-o-clock and then I would go in the house and do my work. In the mourning I would get up and go to work the time would be 9-o-clock when I get to work. I would work till 4 then I would go home and on fridays I would go on the youth club hike to some open place we would then pitch our tents and camp there till mourning. and come back on Sundays. I spend some of my spare time making and doing science experiments I would also have a car and other gadgets to make work easy for any one who cleaned the house.
      In my spare time I would also play rugby, football and criket.  Words: 168
