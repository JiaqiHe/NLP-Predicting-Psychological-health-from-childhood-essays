I would be an Apprentice at a Eltronic factory and each night when I came home at 6`oclock I would watch the telvision and read or get on with homwork I have been given, or if I have a car I might be repairing it. After I have had a read I might go to bed. And some nights I might go out with a girlfriend. For my holidays I would go abroad ** a hotel in Austria. On saturday I would play football in a park or if I was luky I might play for a district team or my works football team if I was lucky to get in to one. At home I might have a cook and a house maid if I was lucky and i might by thinking of getting mairred mean while I would still be getting my Apprentiship and phraps go on to the office that my dad works in if i'm lucky. I would go to work at 8'oclock in the morning and come home at about half past five.  Words: 178
