I am in the army and it is very rough being bosted about but tomorrow I am on leave. I am on the train coming home to my mother on the slums of the fair ground I have 25 pounds to last me a week I am there and mother begins to hug me. It is night and I am tireed so Im going to bed it is old and shraggy its mornin now and I am going on the park to play foot ball I am so hungry I think I will go and have a meal it feels very strange and I am scared this meal is lovely I am going back on the train. It is hard to climb over the net and climbing trees but I will never leave the army. aitough it is a hard and rough life.  Words: 143
