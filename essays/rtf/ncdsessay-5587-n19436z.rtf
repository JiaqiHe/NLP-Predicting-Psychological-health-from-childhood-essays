I am not married and I live in a block of flats on the second storey up. My best friend lives on the ground floor. We are both vets now and work in the same surgery. I left home just before we left veternary collage, as the surgery is a long way from home. I own a lot of animals which include Rabbits, Budgies, Parrots, Cockatoos, Rats, Mice, Gerbils, Hamsters, Fish, Dogs, and cats. When I am at work my mother is sometimes bored so she comes and helps me at the surgery. When I get home I feed all my pets, and let thebirds have a fly round (they all know each other and never fight.) I am engaged and hope to be married very soon. When I am married I hop to have two children. I will call them, for a girl [name] or [name], and for a boy, [name] or [name]. My boyfriend and I met in San FranSisco while we were on holiday there.
