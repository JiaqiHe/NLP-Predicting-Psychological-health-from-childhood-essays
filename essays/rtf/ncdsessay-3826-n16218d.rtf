If I was twenty five I would like to live in a caravan not a house, Also I would like to motor race and be a mechanic so that I can build my own cars and scrutener them like [name]. If I could not be a mechanic I would take after my Father and design roads and motor ways like the M1 and the M62 In my early twenty fives I would go to night school to learn a bit more because I am not really clever, Also I would like to go camping with my freinds in Scotland and wales near the coast My caravan would be a proper static van so that I could keep it in one place for more than a week or two, and my racing car would be a proper car like a lotus  Words: 140
