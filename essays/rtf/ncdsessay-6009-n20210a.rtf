When Im 25 I hope to be a hairdresser and have 3 children and a husband, go to work every morning often I have taken my children to nursery school. I hope to roundabout start work at 1.15 am and close roundabout 5 30 pm every sunday go out to a picnic allday with my children and my husband and in the evening have a babysitter so that we can go out to a resturant and then to the cinema and I hope to have a babysitter round about twice a week. When I have given the children some tea and put them to bed I could get the dinner for us both and after my husband could watch the television while I do the knitting or sewing thats only when we don't go out.
