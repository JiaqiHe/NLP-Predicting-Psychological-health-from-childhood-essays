Today I am going to tell what I (inax) imagine live would be for me when I am 25years old. My life would be a peaceful life as a Mearchant seaman on board a cx [name of employer] liner. This would give me a good time to see the world without paying and even been payed. My intrests would be to see the world, play tennis, be a good swimmer and (leex) be good at my job. I would not settle down to a home for I would never be there most of the time, but I would get a flat everytime I was on leave. When I landed on a country and  there was somthing which I new my Mother wonted I would proably wont it. My work would be a waiter, a bar tender or even a captain. (When I am about 40 I would leave the service (and (**x) do sonx)               The End  Words: 156
