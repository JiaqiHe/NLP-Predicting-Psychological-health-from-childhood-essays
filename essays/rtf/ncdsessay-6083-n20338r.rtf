By the age of 25 I will have got married and if possible own a riding school somewhere in Hampshire I would take up a job as a riding instructor and teach my children to ride. I also would take part in sports such as swimming and athletics. I would like to be a part time teacher at a junior school and then work my way up to a Comprhesive school and teach 14 or 15 year olds. My favourite subject teaching wise would I think be art or pottery, and I should also like to teach Latin and French. I would also arrange lots of cocktail and other parties as I like organising things. I would write books about horses and athletics. My house would be fairly big with about 5 bedrooms and a bathroom and one of the bedrooms whould be a guest room. Downstairs I would have a spacious kitchen and dining room. As well as having a pantry I would have a cellar to keep wine and other things in. I would also have a private room in which to write my books and to get away from the children. My garden which would be very big whould have a shrubry and a lot of grass lawns for my children to play on in the summer. I would invite lots of freinds and important people to the house as my husband would be in polotics.  Words: 239
