I am not married yet and am living in a flat and every day I drive into [town] and start training at the [town] F.C. Every day except for Sunday I train. On Saturday I play for [town]. In the evening I cook my tea and settle down. I have got a television but before I watch it I feed my tropical fish and watch them for a bit. I watch television at about 9 o'clock till 10 o'clock. Then I feed my pet dog, whose name is Cinders and go to bed. I have to get up at eight o'clcok and make my breakfast. I go to [town] in my car which is a Cortina and train as usual. On a Sunday I have a lie in and dont get up till ten o'clock. Often I wish I had a wife when it comes to sunday dinners because I am not a very good cook. In the afternoon I go out to a cinema or go fishing at [town] Pier. I have also got a boat but when it it rough I cant go out in it. I belong to a fishing club but I dont have much time for that. I get xxxx70 a week from my football club, and have got quite a good flat.  Words: 218
