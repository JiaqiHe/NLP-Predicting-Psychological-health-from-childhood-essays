At the age of 25 I would like to be a nurse and study for 2 years. I would like to live away and be a nurse and have 2 children a boy and a girl. At home my hobbys are digging the garden and odd Jobs in the house. When I leave nursing I would like to be a shop keeper and I have a 2 bedroomed house and at the back I have a small garden and one side has a fence to keep the children in and I have a collie wich is a good house dog and watches the children. It attacks anybody who come in the garden at night  Words: 114
