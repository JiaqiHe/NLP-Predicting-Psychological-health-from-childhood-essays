I am interested in horses, arid I live in the country. I would like to be a primary school teacher, as I like children and would enjoy teaching them new things. If I had a family (children) and they went to school the times would fit in with my job. In my spare time I would ride horses and read comics magazines and books, and perhaps go to some shows. I would like to have my own car and a radio fitted into it. Also I would like a girl and a boy. The money for my teaching would pay for a few extra things such as holidays and clothes. I would live in England in the country, with the school just down the road or a little farther away. My children would go with me to the school. When the school day finishes we would go home and go riding, or play games in the house (cottage) or outside. I am also interested in dancing but I would not like to be a Ballerina, at the age of twenty-five years old. I would have a record player, and have a few people, friends to come over and dance, or play bridge or something. At night we might go to a club, or out for supper, or out to a friends house. In our garden we would have a pond and breed a few goldfish just for fun. I would have a brown poudle not a toy, but not a big one just a medium one it must be brown. Also I would have two daxons = two boys  Words: 269
