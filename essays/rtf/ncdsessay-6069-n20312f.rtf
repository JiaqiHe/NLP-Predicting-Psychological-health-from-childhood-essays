My name is Mr. [name]. I am married with four children. My wifes name is [name]. I have a job at a confectionary shop. We get the most peculiar people for customers. Me and my wife are always quarraling about how much money I give to her for wages. I have three hobbies, Football, Cricket and golf.
      My job in the shop is to sell cigarrettes at a bench. I work for seven hrs a day and I have 1/2 an hour rest for lunch. I work until seven at night. I get xxxx20 a week for wages.
      My life at home is quite good although I'm always hitting the children. My son [name] is always a naughty boy. So he tells me off for not giving him any pocket money.
      One day I decided to emigrate to Australia. When we had raised enough money to pay the expenses, we left on May 3rd 1983. It took us four weeks to get there. When we arrived at [city] I got a job at a grocers shop which was the modernest shop I've seen. We got a house in [city], and the rent was xxxx9-10s a week, (in English money). Then about a month later, [name] became pregnant. She went in to hospital, and came out 1 month later with a girl. Whe called her [name] after her mother.
      Then we started to quarrel about certain things. 
      There is not any football in Australia so I took up swimming. My wife was a good teacher and I soon learn't, how to swim. The baby grow up very well and we didn't quarrel anymore.  Words: 273
