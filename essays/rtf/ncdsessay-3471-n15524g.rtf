My life is very interesting and I am a foreman of [company name]. Bill Nicholson (Tottenham Hotspurs manager) wants me to play for him. I exepted his offer because I wanted to see an old friend. I had my first match three days after I was asked to play. We played Manchester United and won 3-0, I scored all three goals the first was by Jimmy Greaves taking a corner I just got my head to the ball and it his the bar and I just scored by the rebound. The second hit from the halfwayline by Cyril Knowles and it was just about to go for a goal kick and Mike England hit it over to me and I hit it past Alex Stepheny and George Best hit off the line back to me and I hit it and George Best couldn't sop it this time because he was still flat on the ground and it went in. The third was not really scored by me beacuse I hit it off David  Words: 173
