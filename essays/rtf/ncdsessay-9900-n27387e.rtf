My birthday was last [month] and I am 25 years old now. My job is a profile cutter this is a person whose job it is to cut shapes out of steel My life is quite pleasant and now that I am older I can things which I could not do when I was a child of 11. The work I do is quite easy and noisy it is just a job of setting the machine to go around a wooden shape and the actual flame from the burner does the rest by cutting the wooden out of steel. Now I am very intrested in football and I go to sea my local team play every match I watch them through good and bad. My home life is quite normal and I do not still play rough games. I just come in from work and ask if my tea is done and what is for tea and then just drop into the armchair and read the newspaper. Now I watch a lot of wild life programmes.  Words: 176
