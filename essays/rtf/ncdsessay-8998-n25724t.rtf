I work in a shoe shop sometimes when I come home I have my tea and then go out. I don't work at the shop shop all the while I only work their at the weekends and in the week I work as a hairdresser. I am busy nearly all the time washing all the scissors and rollers and doing the ladys hair and little girls. I only work in the shoe shop on saturday and on sunday I play rounders and tennis and I just about have a ful week.  Words: 91
