I would be going around in a sports car. I would be married. I would take my wife to somewhere like spain sometimes. I would drive nearly all the time and find different places. I would still play football do high jumps long jump and 100 yds sprint and 200 yds, and cross country running I would do exercises every morning and keep very fit I would have a boat and I would do fishing for a pass time. I would not live in the town I would live in the country and I might do a bit of bird spotting. 
I would have a dog preferably a terrior. And my dog would be very fit too. I do not know what I am going to do as a job. I would not really mind as long as I got quit a lot of monney for it. I would not drink very much and I will not gamble. I will listen to the radio quite a lot. I would go to the cinema quite a lot and watch the t.v.  Words: 180
