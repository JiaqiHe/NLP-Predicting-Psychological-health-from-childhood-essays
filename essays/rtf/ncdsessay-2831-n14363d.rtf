O well, out to the forests again. Still I,m enjoying it. Im a forester now and Im just on the south side of the equator in the forests, the rainy seasons just over and everythings begining the grow. it lasted just under a mounth. Almost all the animals, insects, birds and other things are coming out from where they've been hidding away from the rain. I'm going round Some forests and collecting specimins for Zoos, parks and other places. Every day I find something different and gradually my house gets full up with water creatures insects, jam-jars full of things, So I've made a Sort of Zoo for my Self. Its rather big so I can colect plety of specimins. I went back to England a mounth ago and tell my parents what I've been doing.  Words: 136
