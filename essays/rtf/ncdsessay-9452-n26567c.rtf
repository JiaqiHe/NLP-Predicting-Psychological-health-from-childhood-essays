"I am an engineer at London Airport it is very interesting because you can learn as you go along, and you are the person who is responsible for all of B.E.As aircraft. I live in a town called [London suburb] which is one and a half miles from London (Heathrow) Airport. When I get home I carry on my work but sometimes I go to Loftus Road (Queens Park Rangers 'football Ground) to see them play. My main interest is animals, I have got a dog and a budgerigar, the dogs name is Bruce and he is a Cairn Terrier, he is now seven years old, and he is a brindle colour. My budgerigars name is Joey and he can say quite a few words. The two pets get on quite well with each other and often Joey says to Bruce ""silly Bruce silly Bruce"" and Bruce does a friendly bark in return. Sometimes the cat from next door comes into our garden but not for long beacuse Bruce is a good guard dog and barks at anyone who comes in and the cat is no exception. We got Bruce when he was only three months old and only six inches high he is now ten inches high [London suburb] is now a rapidly growing town and it has a population now of sixty six thousand four hundred approx."
