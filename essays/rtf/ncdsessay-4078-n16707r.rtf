I am 25 years old I would like to be a proffessional footballer and take a part time job. I would like to get married. My interests are breeding rabbits also to fly planes. If I get married I would like to have a house in the country with a thatched roof and a garden where I would grow all soughts of different flowers. The house would be all by itself without another house for miles around. I work as an engineer and get well paid. I have lots of friends. I take driving lessons so that I can get to work quicker and easier. I would stay on at school to go to university where I passed certain examinations to be an engineer. I like my job my friends and if I went on to another job I doubt if I would be very good at my work. I would like to have 2 children a boy and a girl.  Words: 161
