I am a hairdresser and I go home every night and read. My interests are collecting stamps, coins and foreign dolls. I live on my own in a house with my pet dog Gina. I am very keen on being a very good hairdresser. I do not want to leave hairdressing because I enjoy it very much. I have been doing people's hair since I was 12 years old. at the age of 23 years. I start work at 9 pm. and finish at 6.30 am. I do not go on Sundays. On Sunday I take GIna into the country to have a run around if it is nice. If is is not I stay at home. Sometimes we have a lot of customers but other day we hardy have any one at all.  Words: 134
