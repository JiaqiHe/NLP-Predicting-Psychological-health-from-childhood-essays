When I leave home to go to work my child named [name] is still asleep but Judy is not because she wakes up early to see me go then [name] my wife gives her his break-fast and lets her out for 15 minuts too strete her legs. My house that we live in is in [road] by the park and the qaruy has been filled in and a motor way has been bielt. Every June we go on holiday and this year we are going to Irland by plane but we can not take our dog so we are going to let our nabour look after her.  Words: 198
