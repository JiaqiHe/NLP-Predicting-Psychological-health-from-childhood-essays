At 25 years old I am a regular reserve at Stamford bridge. I left school at about the age of 16 and joined the ground staff at Chelsea and in my spre time I made pictures of new stadiums and stands. Soon I will have a wife and four children. At 25 I am leading a good life, with a regular place in the first team at Chelsea we are sixth from the top. The Mexico olimpics coming soon so I am training day and night to try to get a place in Sir Alfs team. One evening I started to draw a new kind of stadium, because I had liked maths work at school, so in the morning I decided to make a model and It worked perfectly. So not only was I a footballer but in the summer and my spare time a desiner, for new stadiums and stands. One of my hobbies was coin collecting I had a fare collection.  Words: 163
