When I am twenty five I will probably work in a bank because it is good pay and interesting work. I would go to work at 7oclock and be there at 8oclock I would work hard utill 11 oclock then break off for a cup of tea or coffee. I would then work untill lunch time When I got home at night I would go swimming or horse riding then I would probably do some ironing. At about 10-1/2 past I would go to bed. 
Today is my day off I think I will do the windows then go out with (name). When I get in it will be dinner-time after dinner I will wash up and then have an hour's rest. At 2 oclock I would go out with the dogs then have tea, I would then wach television for a while have a bathe then go to bed.  Words: 150
