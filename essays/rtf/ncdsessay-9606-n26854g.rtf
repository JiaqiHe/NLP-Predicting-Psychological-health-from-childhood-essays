When 25 I would be a ploiceman, and I would play football very often it would be my hobbie. Then I would live in a very big house, and have a dog it be a bulldog I think or a boxer. I think I would have a big Garden and a lot of flowers. There would be a pond in the middle of the Garden. I would like a few trees in the Garden but ones. I would go to work at 7 o'clock in the morning and come back at 9 or 10 o'clock. I think I would have a televison and a radio. I would be leading a very good life but a very hard one as well. One of the hard things would be getting up in a morining I think I would have a very big car it would be call a jaguar.  Words: 147
