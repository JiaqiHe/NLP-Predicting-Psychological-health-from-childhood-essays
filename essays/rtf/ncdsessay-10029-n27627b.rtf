"My name is ****. I live in america new york but I am origanly English. I am a newspaper reporter. I catch on all the big story's. at the moment I live in a small apartment in town. I have got an open roof car. It helps me to get around so that I can get my storys. the paper I work for is rather popular and my job pays well. I get aproximately four hundred $ a week. after paying my way for food and all the other facilities it leaves me about two hundred $. Most of my friends I met at work. At night I go out with them for a drink or mabe a drive in mo**e. Some times when I have just got in bed the office phones up to say something like ""Ive got a story for you John. "" So then I have to pick up my note pad pen and camera and drive to the office as fast as I can to be given further instructions. Then I go where ever I have got to go get my story drive back to the office and then back to my apartment and bed. Well thats my life story and I enjoy it, bye."  Words: 210
