I am an aeroplane pilot flying off an aircraft carrier. My interests are snooker and table tennis. I only fly single seater aeroplanes across the sea. I am working on stand by ready for a mission, mostly I search for people that have to be rescued. I get a two week holiday every two months and when we tie up on a island I get a two day holiday I am not married and I have no house of my own I usually stay with my parents on holiday sometimes I work on land teaching people to fly jet aircraft for the Air Force. Sometimes I fly helicopters accross land in mock battles and training I also fix the aeroplanes and helicoptors for the Air Force and Army.  Words: 128
