I am Twenty Five. I live in a house with my wife. I go to work, I work at the ****. I am a forman. When I do not go to work on Saturdays I play football sometimes cricket, I go to watch **** play nearly every saturday thats if I am not working. When I am at home I help my wife do her housework but not all of it. On Sundays if there is cricket on I go and watch that. I usaully go to sleep on Sunday afternoons. My home is well decorated we have a living room kitchen front room a hall two tiolets one outside and oen inside we have three bedrooms and have got beds in because we've got two children. I have got a car it is a Vauxhall super 101 it is coloured light blue. We go for rides in it on Sunday nights. We usually go to a pub. The children have fun going to pu*s. One of my children is a boy and the other a girl. The boy is older than the girl because the boy is 4 and the girl is two. They go to bed early because they are young.  Words: 203
