I go and play football for an international team. I play for them each Saturday and go training on a Wednesday. The money they give me is xxxx70 a week but I put xxxx20 in the bank because I am saving up for a car. I would like to get a Volkswagon at xxxx1,200. I already have a moterbike but it is getting old and a bit rusty so if I can sell it it would be a lot of use because it takes up some room and the money will go to the bank for the car. I also go swimming which I engoy. I work in an electric shop selling things like washers and hair driers anything to do with electric. I still live with my mother and father and I have to pay them to live there. Most of the city's and towns have changed. They all have skyscrapers and underground railways. Each tube train is always packed and are hard to get on. At home I build model aeroplanes and some have moters in which are best because I go flying them on [area] Moor. I go with a club in [town]. They are quite hard to transport without breaking them but I seem to manage most times. I go to night school on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Last week I missed it because I had flu and I was in bed.
