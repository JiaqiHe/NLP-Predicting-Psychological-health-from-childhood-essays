----------------------
By now I am married and have one child, a little girl who is two years old. Most of my time is taken up with work in the house, for I am a housewife and have no outside work.
My husband is a bisiness man, and although he does not come home for every day, he does usually manage to come home for at least the weekend. We live in our own house, not a council or tied* house, and it is quite new and has a fairly big garden.
I would not be living in [town], but I would not be to far from my parents and friends. We have a car, and I have learnt how to drive. I have not much time for hobbies or sports as the housework and the baby take up nearly all of my time, although my husband and I manage to have a holiday away at least once a year.
I have plenty of house-keeping money every week, and the baby (whose name is [female name]) and I are always well clothed and fed. As Vicky does not mind being left on her own with a baby-sitter my husband and I sometimes have time to go to resteraunt or a party in the evening.  Words: 209
