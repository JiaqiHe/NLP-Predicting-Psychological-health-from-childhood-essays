My name is [name] and I am 25 years of age. I live in a nice little bungerlow in [town]. I live by myself. My job now is a works engineer at [company]. The factory makes machines for tyres, calendars, floor tiles and pellets. It is a big firm with lots of machines* and men. The job, I have is a very hard job. You have to get men to get machines and tools. At least every day we have a new machine.
We are all well paid. For dinner hours we have about one hour. The works have a canteen, which I get my dinner from every day.
After work I go home to my bungerlow and make my tea. As I sit and eat it I think of the time I was at the Olimpic games. It was The event 14 and it was the four length freestyle and I was in lane four as the starter fired his gun, I was quick away I was leading all the way untill I came to the turn. Then a Americaian took the lead but I cort up and went on to win. I always think of that and I always wont to do that again. On Thursday nights I go to Harlow swimming club to coach some children. I goto bed early because I had to get up early in the morning. I have breakfast and at eight o'clock I set off to work it takes me about ten minutes.  Words: 249
