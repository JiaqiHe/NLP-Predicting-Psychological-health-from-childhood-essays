Now that I am 25 years old I will still be going to night school and I want to get a nice job and I will leave when I am about 30 years of age. I want a job and get payed a lot of money so that I can give it to my mother and father and kepp the rest. When I go from school I will triy and find the best job that I know of. Then if I do not like it I will find a diferent job. When I get old I will setle in a house with my wife and my family and when I diey I will give all my money to my wife. I will not be buried but I will be crosifed and bernt. Befor that I will go o london for an holiday and I might stay up there and see if I can get a beter job if posible.
After I will allways rest on Saturdays and Sundays but I will work the rest of the week. Sometimes I will rest for a week and go on a holiday to the seaside. I will have a good house and a good family. Then I will come back and see my friends again. But when I have sean* their I will visitit all my schools and see how my teachers are getting on. I will always remember the days when I was a little boy. I will have to look in when I pass and see all the little boy and girls in the school. I will let my little children go to school and get a good wetpy* scoler ship from one school to another and make there life a happy one. When they grow up I hope that they get a good job like the ones that I get. If they get an epsilent report I will let them mary anybody they want to.  Words: 324
