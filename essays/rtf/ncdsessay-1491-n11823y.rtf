I am Now 25 years old. I like I cooking for my husband. I am an Riding instructor I enjoy my work. I like doing any handy jobs. I like painting and decorating. I like children I have a child of my own who is now 1 year of age. We have a big garden with a lot of flowers. There is a swing and a slide inthe garden. We live in the country. I own stables the stables are at the back of the house. We have 30 horses 10 shetland ponies, 10 welsh mountain ponies and 10 hunters. When children come they saddle there ponies and then we go for a long ride in the country. When we came back we would take the saddle and bridle of and rub them down and then give them oats, HAy and bran. My husband is a carpentar. The riding school is closed on a sunday and that is the day I have a rest from the horses. I like to keep the house tidy. But withe the baby it is hard work, becaise she throws them every where. On a sunday we sometimes go for a ride in the car but otherwise we stay home and have a rest unless with have visitors. I enjoy my work, interests, and my home life.  Words: 222
