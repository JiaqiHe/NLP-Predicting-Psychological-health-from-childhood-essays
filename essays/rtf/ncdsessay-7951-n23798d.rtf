"I am an electonics engineer and I work in the engineering shop of 6-6-6 squadron which is mainly swing wing air craft and a few Vulcans. At the moment I am a bacholar but I hope I get married next year. I was at University for three years. It's great fun working here and when the C.O. lets me I like to take a glider up and spend some time in noiseless flight. I live in the country far away from here. I do like fiddling with radar and things like that. My ""den"" at home is over crowded with papers but the rest of the house is tidy. I am always rather neat. I like playing basketball. When I left university I came here the cheif engineer was a nice old chap and showed me the works. I had learn't quite alot about aircraft engines at university and training collegde. My girl friend [female name] [surname] though I would be very handy around the house if we* were married. The ""Chief"" showed me it wasn't as easy as it looks on diagrams. On the diagrams they showed every thing and it looked pretty easy. But if you wanted to change"  Words: 201
