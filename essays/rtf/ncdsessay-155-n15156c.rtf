At the age of 25 I would like to be a fisherman on a trawler far out to sea and come back in every two or three weeks. I would stay in every two or three weeks. I would stay in a bungalow and have a big garden and a big car. The kind of fish I would catch would be haddock cod and plaice. When I landed I would stay for two days and mend all the nets and go home to my house to stay for two nights and get my clothes washed and see if the boat had been refueled and the food was taken aboard and set out to sea when all the crew had came down. I would like to have a crew of twenty.  Words: 130
