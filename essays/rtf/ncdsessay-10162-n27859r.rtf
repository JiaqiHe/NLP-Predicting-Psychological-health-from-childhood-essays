It was a bright summers day the sun was shining. I layed strecked out on a soafer studying my books, for i eight more weeks I was to take my exames and if I passed I would be able to go and teach at a primary school in (place). I had wanted to do this ever since I was the age of seven. Because I was trainning to be a teacher I was only able to get a half time job which was a secutary and I didn't get much time in which to do the things I liked such as, Tennis, Swimming, and writting poems. But my main intrests were not disderped, because I was able to do them when I was studying to be a teacher. My intrests are, stone collecting, stamp collecting, reading about my ansesters, and collect-ing coins.
Eight weeks had passed it was time for me to take my exames. I was very nerv-ers but I finally passed and went to live in (place) so I could teach at my new school.
About two to three months went by and I was enjoying teaching, I taught manily Maths, English and History, but sometimes I would teach swimming and dancing. I enjoyed teaching so much that i cept on teaching untill I was at the age of 50.  Words: 220
