I work as a typist in a large block of offices just outside [city]. Its a very interesting job but if you make about two mistakes on every page, even if its just a letter such as 'e' you have to type it over and over again until it is absoulutely perfect. My boss is the kind who tells you exactly what to put and then he says it doesn't sound wright when I read it back to him. I am married and have a wonderful family. My husbands name is [name] and I have three beautiful children who's names are. [name]. [name] and [name] the baby. Their ages are 4. 2. and 6 months. As you can guess its pretty hectic having to feed four hungry mouths four times a day but I manage to get time off and its worth it because I get paid for each day. I like to read and so our house is full of books. I also have two sewing machines, one for hand sewing and the other one is electric. With three lots of clothes to make you can't really blame me. At tthe moment I'm making a dress for [name]. We have a five bedroom house and as [name] and I sleep together we always have a spare bedroom for guests. Well. thats really all I can say about my life. Ive got to go to work.  Words: 236
