My child has to go to a nursery school from 10o'clock to 4 o' clock. My husband works at a bank. I like reading books and listening to pop music and I like going to the cinema. My husband gets 30 pounds a week and I get 20 pounds. Next year my child will go to school and I will have to stop my job because [female name] will come out at 3.30. and I finish my job at 4 o' clock. Nearly every Sunday my mother and father come to see us and they stay to tea. We are going to move soon so we will not see out mother and father. We are going to Australia. Where my aunt lives, in Queensland. We are going in one years time. They say its hot there but I think we will manage. My husband will be a sheep-shearer and he will earn 22 pounds a week.
