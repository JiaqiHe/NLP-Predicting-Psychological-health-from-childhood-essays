"I now work as an Electrician for the Post office. I work six days of the week, but only half day on Saturday's. My base in in the west End of London, and I rent a flat rather than having the bother of commuting from [suburb]. Every week out of my wages I put a little sum to put in the Post office or building society. At Christmas, Easter or bank holidays I travell home to see my Parents and visit my friends. Most of my friends are now Londoners, but I still send letters frequently to my old friends. I find life in the flat very dull so on Saturday afternoon's I often go to a football match for a little excitement. I like watching football but I am not very good at it myself. A good game of Badminton I prefer. I joined a club in London and go on Sunday's. I stay there all day and have a ""snack"" lunch instead of cooking myself. I often use the club as a resturant other days of the week. I constantly ask my friends to join but they always refuse. I recently joined a library, as I am a keen reader and read books when I have nothing else to do. I take *** three book every fortnight but sometimes they get overdue. I normally take fiction book, my faurite of which, are the detective stories. I do cook my own evening meals; they usually consist of egg and bacon. Sometimes if friends are round I cook something just a little more fancy to impress them. This is usually once a month."  Words: 273
