I am a pilot flying a Hovercraft. Iam taking people to the Isle of Wight and Wales and Ireland. I am not married; I am too busy travelling at top speed.
In my free time I fly my Tiger Moth
I live in England in a little house at the airfield which I live in on my own. 
I have two hangars one is very big for the hovercraft.  Words: 67
