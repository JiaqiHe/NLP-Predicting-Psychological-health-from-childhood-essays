I am a groom. I look after 4 Arabs I get there at half past six in the morning there is a bitter chill in the air. We turn the horses out and much out the stables Throw in the clean straw and spread in around. Then we groom the horses, saddle and bridle them off we go. We canter along the common. When we get back we rub them down and feed them and turn them out. I ride home on my bike and get my dinner. In the afternoon I clean out the house and make my med. I thought that I would go out to tea. The next day was my day off so I stayed in bed until half past eight, made my bed. I had made my breakfast the evening before. When I eventually got down rover my pup had wet the kitchen floor and had chewed the mat I lit the gas ring and put the kettle on I unlocked the door and brought in the two pints of milk. After having ate my breakfeast I feed the landlady's chickens and I was swinging the bucket a little too hard and it swung back and hit my arm. It felt very swore and it looked red. So I put on my dress and cardegan. Then I went it to the town and found the docter and he told me I had cracked the bone so I had to have it put in plaster.  Words: 249
