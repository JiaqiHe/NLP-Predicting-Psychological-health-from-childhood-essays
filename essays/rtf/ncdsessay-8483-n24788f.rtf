Now I am 25 I will just carry on doing the usuall things. When it doesn't do any thing supecta**** 25 years old I shall do my old same job, I shall till go out with boys its not as if I were too old to go out with boys it dosn't change any thing or do anything. When you get older about 15-16 and upwards years old you don't go home change you clothes and go out on the raod to play football or something like I do now will I . I shall have to wear a dress or flares something lady like but I like being a tomboy its fun playing Rugby. football and cricket and all the boys games. I wouldn't mind being 25 eyars old at least I wouldn't have to go to school thou people do say I'd rather be at school that work, but I don't think so. You would have to do your homework before you can go out, because you wouldn't have any to do. You are a few more years to you death bed.  Words: 184
