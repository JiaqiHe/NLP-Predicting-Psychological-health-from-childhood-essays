My name is [female name] [surname] , I have just finished my Univercity training and have a B.A. in Social Studies and English. I have a fianc to whom I am getting married to in six months ime I long to start my married life on the right foot. Both my husband-to-be and I long to live in Switzerland where we spent our holidays with our parents, for it is where we first met. I get on very well with my parents and they are both very kind to my fianc and myself. They are helping me financially and are great with advice on everything. My interests are much the same as when I was at my grammer school. My fianc and I, have much in common, which lets us get on so well with each other. In a few weeks' time I shall start working at G.E.C. where my mother is a secretry. The money I receive shall go to furniture in our house. I am busy make curtains, and suchlike to save money. Nothing exciting is happening at this moment. I am practices hard for a violin exam (Grade 8) I will be taking shortly. There is not much more to say, except that I have got pre-marrage nerves already, although I am not nervous are my violin exam. That is about all so I will close up my mini biography.  Words: 233
