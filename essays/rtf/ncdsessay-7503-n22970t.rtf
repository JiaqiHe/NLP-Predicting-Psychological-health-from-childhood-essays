I have two children now. One aged four and the other aged one. They are both girls. [female name] my four year old has just started school. [female name] my youngest child comes with me to the hospital where I work. [female name] goes to be looked after with lots of other small children while I go  visiting patients to hear all their troubles. I am called an Armour lady.
I get home at five o'clock where clare is awaiting me. We have tea, it is usually my tasty home made bread with jam on. In the evening when [female name] has been put to bed I play the piano whilst [female name] sings with me. 
At a quarter past six [female name] goes to bed. So that she does not stay in the bath to long or get cold we say our two times table. 
As my husband always appears to be hungry when he gets home from work, I give him soup with stake and kidney pie, I very much enjoy making it.
After supper we spend happy and enjoyable hours talking over the day and playing duets on the piano.
I have Monday, Wednesday and Friday off, in that time I do the housework.  Words: 204
