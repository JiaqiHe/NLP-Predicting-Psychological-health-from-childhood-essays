My outdoor hobbies are football and rugby and I play for Torrance Athletic. I am not married and hardly ever go out. I usually just sit down and lace during the week-end but sometimes do some gardening. On week days I work for the Port of Bristol Authority. I am saving up most of my wages up to go to Canada to live. When there I want to live in Ontario. I have two cars one is a Fiat which I drive to work in and the other is Porshce Carrera 6 which I race in once a month at Castle Coombe. I now live in [village], Nr Bristol. When I come home from work and have had my tea I watch the t.v. till 6.30 pm then go to Soundwell swimming baths till 7pm. When I come back from the baths I watch t.v. till 11 pm have some supper and then go to bed. My alarm clock wakes me at 7.15am then I change, have a quick breakfast and I go to work at 8 AM. I have dog named Butch who is a bulldog. Butch, when I am gone to work is looked after by my friend next door.  Words: 202
