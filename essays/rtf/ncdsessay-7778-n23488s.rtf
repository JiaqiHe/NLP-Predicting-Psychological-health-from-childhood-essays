My Mother and Father would be quite old now. My sister and Brother would both be in thier fortys I would not be marreid yet, but I would have a boy friend. I would go out a lot go to cafes, pubs, and other places like the cinema. I would not live at home but in a flat with my friends. We would take turns in cooking, washing up and making tea in the morning. I would be away most of the day as I would not have regular meals and be on a diet most of the time. I would be a nurse and go home to see my parents sometimes. I would go to bed after eleven, and get up at seven.  Words: 124
