My interests is to help animals and people. And get marryed and have children round four or five even more. My home is to help my children with there diffcults and trouble. Do things for my husband like getting his breadfast early in the morning. Get the children of to school saftly. Do the house work then go of to work myself to help people and animals when they are sick or ill. Then get home and get the dinner but first meet the children from school. Then when my husband gets home in the evening so can have his dinner as the children did. Because my husband works all day. and has his dinner watch televisions for two hours then of to bed and get a good night sleep. Then it starts all over again the next day. If I get sack from the job I would like to be come a teacher or a student for a class at little [school name] or Infat school. If I do become a teacher, I like to go to night school because I have better mind to think from to give anser to the question I've been asked to do. The first lesson I would like to see if a group of children, to see how much the children have learnt for arithmetic. and English and all the either object. If it was one of my children birthday I would give him a pery and a present from the husband and I. and give 5/- to spend on want he like to spent it, sweets, toys anythings.  Words: 266
