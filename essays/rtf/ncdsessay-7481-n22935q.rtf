I have just come home from work at the (place). There I am a scientist and am working on my latest project. I drive a car and enjoy going to all diferent kinds of places. I am not married yet and I live with my parents. I only cook my food when they are out, but I do not like it. I go to work five days a week and work from 9.00 a m untill 6pm but it takes me some time to get to the Research station, so I have to start out quite early in the morning. The car which I am still paying for is a new Ford Capri which is a shining green. The engine of my car is only 1300 c.c. but nevertheless it can go at a speedy rate on the motorways.
My main interests is motoring around the country and I have visited a large number of places. The best place I have ever been to is (place) on the south coast. The only trouble with it is that in the summer it gets so crowded. If I go there in April to May, although the weather isn`t as hot as it is in the summer, I can roam along the clifftops in complete solitude  Words: 212
