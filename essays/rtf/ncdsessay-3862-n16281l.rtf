I have left my flat and I am on my way to the office. I am the secetary of a business which deals with all the exports which come into port from many countries all over the world. We often get a trip around the ship but a the moment we are very busy, Although I might get a trip around one of the realy big ships this afternoon. Lots of the people who work here are very friendly but some are not as nice. I have been working here now for over two years and I hope to stay for another two. This summer there are about ten girls and five boys who are going to Switzerland for a month, and I hope that I will be picked to go with them as their is one more vacancy. When I reach the office I will start a hard days work. Even though I when to university I have never done such hard work as I am doing at this business office even though I enjoy it here. I picked this job because I thought it might have been easy but as I have found out, it's not.  Words: 198
