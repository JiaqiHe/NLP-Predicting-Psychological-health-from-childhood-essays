I have to get up in the morning at Half past six then start at seven for the garage. When I get there at half past seven then start at eight a clock after I have had a cup of coffe or tea. Then if I have eny spar time before I reale start I just muck a bout with some of my mates. I go home at six o'clock. I whach the telovison for the rest of the night but some times I have to do some thing around the house. on my holidays in the week I like to go swiming for two hours. If it is sunny I take my wife out for the day we some times go to [town] becase we live just out side about ten miles away. On Saterday nights I go down to the pub if I am in the write shift. My next door naber has got a moter bicke and it is all ways braking down so I go round and help him on it. when we have got it working agen we go up the fields on it. It all ways bracks down when we are on it. So I have to go back and fixit agen.  Words: 208
