At the age of twenty five I would like to be a zoologist. I would not like to get married untill I was thirty. In my spare time I would study hard and have a few hobbys. I would like to live away from the city. When I do get married I would have two children. I would try to get a very large garden and if I couldn't I would have an allotment. If I could not become a zoolgise I would like to be a vetinary surgeon. I love animals and such things and when I am twenty five I would love to become one of the above things.  Words: 111
