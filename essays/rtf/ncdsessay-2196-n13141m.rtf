I am now 25 yrs old and am not living at home but in Plymouth I've always wanted to live here. I go out every Saturday with my boyfriend we go to the pictures and to clubs he's got a car. During the week I work in a big shop its great fun on Sundays I usualy stay at home and tidy the place up. It's a flat just right for me. I hope to soon be getting married then I will move into a house which has a nice garden my house didn't have a big garden and it wasn't all that much fun playing in the road. When I leave my flat I might be just a house wife. I often visit my parents. My brothers are all living in differant places but we all keep in touch. I get holidays during the year and I visit my parents and then we go on trips to Castles and museums I like visiting such places. I like collecting china ornaments ect. I like thing like that I've still got some things from when I was small. When I was small I whanted to be a teacher in a primary school but I dont whant to now. Thoe I often thing about teaching in a nursery while my children are small if I have any. I often thought of that while I was small I visited one once while the school holidays were on. I liked it at school very much. I like making some of my clothes but also like buying them too. I often knit clothes for my self, I like kniting better then sewing. Sometimes when I'm in the mood I do some painting I've always liked art.  Words: 291
