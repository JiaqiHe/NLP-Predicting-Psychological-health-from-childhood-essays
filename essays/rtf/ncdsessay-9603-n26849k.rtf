My sister never really cared about work when she was at school, she's interested in sports. She would of been better as an atlete. Being a secretary isen't the only thing I like going to night school and I love reading. I wanted to be an editor. I'm hopeing Mr [surname] will go to spain or to a different country on buisness and take me with him to help but not for longer than a fortnight I'll miss my mother an awful lot and my father.
Im also go trampling once every week for exercise. I go out some evenings with a boyfriend and he's nice, kind, and considerate and he's got a lovely nature. For my holidays I'm hopeing to go abroad to Holland, Spain, Italy, or France and go to see all the places werever I go I'm saving some of my money up. I belong to a library and get books out every so often I like reading in bed.  Words: 273
