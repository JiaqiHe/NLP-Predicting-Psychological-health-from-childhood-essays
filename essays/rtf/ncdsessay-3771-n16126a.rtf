"I had (recently) moved to America. I had started work as a scientist in physics, chemistry a little biology and also a little astronomy. It was a very interesting life, quite a lot of money coming in as well as very adequate living accomodations. When I was not working I was generally at my ""digs"" reading, cooking, knitting or sewing. I read a lot about astronemers in the past especially the very early ones, and also about the mistakes they made which we know. now, the correct reasons. 
      Sometimes on Friday nights I would eat out for a change which was much better because I knew I had'n't cooked it. When I could I would get to bed at nine thirty to ten o-clock and get up at seven thirty This wasn't very easy because I often carried on my work later than other days so sometimes I only got to bed at quarter to eleven.
About once a week I had to give a thirty minute lecture this was held generally on Wednesay or Thursday. So when I got back on Monday and Tuesday from work I could be seen puzzlling over a piece of paper.
I had four weeks of holiday for the year, in two of these weeks I generally flew back to England which was my home country."  Words: 221
