My name is [name] and I am a pharmacist. I work in a chemists shop for a man named Mr [name]. Some day I hope I will own a chemists shop. I work from 9 a.m. - 6 p.m. and I have Wednesday's and Sunday's off. I am engaged to a very handsome bussiness man and we hope to get married very soon. Then we might move into the countryside (not too far from the town). My hobbies are ice-skating, Polish dancing, collecting old and unusual stories and exploring ruined and old places. During my spare time I like to read and do one of the hobbies that I have already mentioned. At the moment I am living with my mother and father. My brother is married my other brother is married as well and my sister she is still at school. Once a year I go an visit all my old schools some time ago I used to visit them twice a year but now I just haven't the time.  Words: 171
