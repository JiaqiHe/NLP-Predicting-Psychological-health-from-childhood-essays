I am training to be a hairdresser I go to a hair stylist every day when I am fully qualified I am going to get my own hairdressers shop. I am going to learn to drive when I am 26 years old and when I start driving and when I have past my test I will get my own car I will get the same kind of car as I was taught in but if I do not like the car I learn in I will get another type. I will go for rides in the country and take people about in my car. If my mother wants me to take her down town or to see her freinds I can just get the car out and take her in the car. My sister also is training to be a hair dresser. She wants us to go in joint name. If we go abroad agian together I can take my car with us.  Words: 163
