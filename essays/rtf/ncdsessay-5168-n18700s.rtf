At the age of 25. I hope to be a private secretary, working the owner of a large firm. I would like to have a house in the peace and quiet of the country. By that time, I hope to be married with some children , two at the most, a boy and a girl. Living in the country I would expect to have a car. A small one would be fine. I hope that my job as a secretary would be an interesting one and that I have plenty to do so I would never get . If I was a private secretary , I would like to have one or two junior secretarys under me.
At the weekend when I'm off, I think it would be nice if we could all go for either a walk or a drive in the car. That would build up an appetite for dinner.
For my 3 weeks annual holidays , I would to go abroad with the family or to my mother's to stay.  Words: 171
