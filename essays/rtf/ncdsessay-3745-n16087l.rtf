A DAY OF MY LIFE

Saturday morning at eight o' clock I get up i get ready to go to work which is linesman at a football match. First of all I go and put the corner flag in. I then go and put sawdust down to mark the goal lines. penalty box and spot centre line and *** lines. During the match I ***** when it is a **** or if the attacking player is offsid. after the game I have a ****** or a hot bath. then we have something to each such as a sandwich and a cake and a drink of hot tea. When i get home I watch the television until it is time for bed  Words: 120
