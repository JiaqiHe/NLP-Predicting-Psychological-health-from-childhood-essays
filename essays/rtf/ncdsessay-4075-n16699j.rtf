I am living in a semi-detached house in ****. I am a weather meterdigest and I send my reports to the **** weather centre. somtimes I go up to **** when they are a bit short of people or when there's a rush of reports. At home I also like gardening and I am now busy getting rose cuttings. once a week I go fishing with a club at ****. We usually go to **** pond where there is lots of fish. There are private: keep off notices all round the pond because the club have bought the pond, but sometimes when we go fishing there are teenagers with transister radios and the music from the radios scare the fish away but we can do nothing about it because the teenagers are not actually fishing in the pond. I am married and I two children, peter, 5 and John, 4. Peter has just started school and John will be starting school next year. I have a car and It is a Morris oxford Brake the registration is ****. We also have a dog, its name is yogi and it is very friendly with the children. It a cross between a labrador and a sheepdog. It has a white chest and three white paws all the rest of it is brown. It's hair is moulting now and we did have a black rug but now it has changed into a brown rug even though we do clean the house twice a week. There are some cows in the field at the back of house and when we let Yogi out he stands in the the garden and banks* at the cows. There is a fence which stops Yogi from chasing the cows.
