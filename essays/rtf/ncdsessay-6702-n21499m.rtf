I wake up in the morning at eight O'clock and then I have my breakfast. After that at half past eight I get my car out then I drive to work, I get to work at a qauter to nine. I work in a place where they make airoplanes. At dinner break I go to a cafe and I have some sandwitches and some tea. Then I start work again at five o'clock I go home and have some tea. When I have finished my tea I feed the tropical fish. On Saturdays I don't go to work. In the morning I go fishing and I come back at dinner time. After dinner I go swimming and then I watch television. My intrests are breeding tropical fish, fishing and football.  Words: 130
