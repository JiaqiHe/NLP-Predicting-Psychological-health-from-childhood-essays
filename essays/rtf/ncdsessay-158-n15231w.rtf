I am leading a happy life. I live with my parents. I have a good job at [xxxxxxx] factory ana [illegible fiche - and] I get quite a lot of money in my pay packet.   I am still a keen stamp collector, along with coins, cricket and football these are about my only hobbies. My job is Production Planner, as was my dad's job. I play for the [xxxxxxx] 1st eleven and I bowl, bat and field. I like football but I don't play for any kind of team. I have a lot of stamps and I should think they are worth a lot of money, I don't collect coins as much as I used to but I have a lot. Dad still works at the factory but will retire in about 6 more years. When I come home from work there is a lot of paper work to do, I have to fill in big 5 foot long pieces of paper these are to do with my job and they take up most of the evening. We have moved to a new house, it is a bungalow and is quite nice. The [xxxxxxx] factorys are now all over [xxxxxxx], I was offered a job in [xxxxxxx], but I did'nt want it. I am happy with my life, but it could be a lot better!  Words: 225
