I enjoy life at twenty five and I like it at home with my family and everything quiet, sitting in a warm arm chair and watching the television. I also like listening to the radio. I like it in the summer when the fruits have come out and we are eating them. I lead a nice life and I am glad I am twenty five.  Words: 174
