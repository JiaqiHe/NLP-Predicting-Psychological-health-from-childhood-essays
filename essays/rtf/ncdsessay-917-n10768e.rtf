I have got a big place for my home. I have got a lot of rooms, so I decided to keep puppies and kittens and when they were older they would go into another room I have quite a busy life because I also look after small children before they go to school. I take them for a walk to the park each morning. The dogs and cats come with us also. At four o'clock they go home and the dogs eat thier meals. The dogs and cats have to go into different rooms to have thier meals because the dogs eat the cats meals and the cats eat the dogs. I have my dinner at 1 o'clock with the little children. The dogs and cats play until 9 o'clock then the puppies and kittens go to thier baskets. Then at half past nine the dogs and cats go to thier baskets and at 1/2 ten I go to bed sometimes I go out and when I come back the animals and I go to bed.  Words: 176
