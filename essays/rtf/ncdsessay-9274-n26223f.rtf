Now I am 25 years old and I am going well with my job as a brick layer. I useally go to diffrent places but most of the time I stay in the contrey. I get plenty of jobs so i get lots of mony to buy some tools and ladders to go with my job. Also I will put some money in the bank so that if I leave my job I will still have plenty of money. The jobs I mostly like to do is to build garages and bungalows. Most of the bungalows I build is at (place) there not hard to build in fact it only takes nealy six months to finish building it. On my holidays I make some replacements in my home and in the evening I rest.  Words: 134
