My work at the age of 25 will be a vetinary surgon. I hope I will be thinking of marrage as I love children. My biggest interest will still be swimming I hope I will be leading my life very happily and I hope my children are happy too. I want two children one a boy and one a girl. I will love the animals that I work with and I will have a hamster at my home. When my children are young I will leave my work till they go to school. I will learn my children to swim at the age of 3. I will still borrow books from the library. I will cook my own cakes. I will join the Save The Children Fund Group of my area. I will do everything I can for starving and naked children. I will start a book for children about a game I used to play.  Words: 156
