I am a vet, I live in London and I have a mobile surgery in the quiete parts. Iam very interested in tennis, golf and swimming etc. In my spare time I go to a club were I play billiards and drink. Our surgery goes on from 6oclock till six-thirty, on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. I do all the house work and things like that.
At the surgery we have a proper table, and untensils. The animals that I have worked on are realy fantastic for instance I have taken a frog out of a king kobra's throat, helped a horse to have a foal, helped* a lamb for adoption. I have five cats, two ducks and a donkey their names are Rover, Rubbish, Blache Bloomers Help*, Bill jannina* and trubshaw, 
Iam not married. I live in a flat in [street name]. The nicest thing I have ever done is to save a *** from choking on dog biscuits.  Words: 158
