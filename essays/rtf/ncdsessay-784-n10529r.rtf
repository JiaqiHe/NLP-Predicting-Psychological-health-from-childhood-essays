My name is [name], and I have been marride for four year. I have no children, but I am a part time dancing teacher. I have been dancing for many years I started dancing when I was nine years old. The house work is not very difficult to do with haveing no children. I visit my Mum and Dad twice a week sometimes more, they are quite old now and I have to do many things for them, but they are not in wheel chairs yet. I also visit my husbands mum, his farther died in the war. I do not spend all my time dancing or visiting the family I have to cook the different meals, and be home when my husband is, also I have to do the shopping. Sometimes when I have a spare after noon I sew, I have a sewing machine. some of the people around the village ask me to make a dress or two for their children. The house has been furnished right through and there are no more bills the pay only the electrick bill and the telephone bill. When we have some children I will leave my job until the are five years old and can go to school I don't no if I will go back to my dancing then.  Words: 220
