At the age of 25 I would be working at a training course for a place in the police force. The thing I would like if I got into the police force would be to train and handle a police dog. These are mostly alsations why I cannot tell. I live in a flat not far from the training school. I have my own dog which comes from the breed of spaniels. I in **** at **** Court*. I am living on the sixth floor up. The training goes on from 9am to 6pm with 2 hour lunch break starting at 12 noon. The course consists of expert policemen being chased by the recruits, walking and climbing walls as quickly as possible. Once that is over for the day we go into the school room for some teaching. The pyschical training takes place in the morning and the schooling in the afternoon. After tea I usually fo fishing for an hour or so. After that I do my homework ready for the next day. When that is finished I do a few odd jobs concerning the flat. Round about 10 p.m. I take Pip for a walk (Pip is my dog). At half past 10 I have my supper then I go to bed.  Words: 214
