7 o'clock on a mondy, and I'm getting up, to go to my job as an electrical engineer in Bath, we start at nine and finish at five. We have a twenty minute break in between in which I leave work to do some shopping or something for my wife. My wife is preparing my break-fast of Bacon and eggs. When I've finished breakfast I go of to work in my dark green rover-2000. It's a lovely car with tin plated and highley polished ashtrays, and lovely comfotable seats. I get to work at about 8.15 after picking up two of mates. At five o'clock when the bell goes, my mates and I usaully go down the nearby pub and have a pint or two. As I'm driving, I do not have too many pints and while there drinking I go along to the news agent and buy the daily express. After finishing at the pub, I drop of my mates and go back home. I always buy my 5 year old son a bar of chocolate. When I get home my son always rushes to me knowing that I've got the chocolate.  Words: 193
