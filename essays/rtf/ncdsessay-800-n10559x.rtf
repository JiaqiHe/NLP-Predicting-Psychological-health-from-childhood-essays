I hate people who start moanning all because the lost in a game and I hate people who are always misirable and not enjoying themsalves I would wear make-up of out to meet some one. I might kepp one pet and that is a cot. If I was going to have a holiday I think I would go a brod somewhere. I like going shopping in town. A real night out to me is when I go to a party with music something to eat and to drink. I would have one boyfriend and I would not fly in to a rage if he wanted to go. I might have as firends some of the firend had at school.  Words: 193
