I am now training to be a shop keeper I wished very much that I was a teacher but you have to be very clever to be one of those.
I will stay in the shop for about five years. After that I will go in for a more highley skilled job. Buy now I think that I will be marrid a had children. Most probley I will not have a job because I'll be looking after the children. 
Then I might go and live in spain I have been when I was ten years old, and I thought how lovely it was. I will not go in less all the others agree. When the children are older and they go to school and we are in England I will get a job as a kithchen woman at the school. If I get any other job most probley the hours will be wrong and the children will be alone. But if we do go to spain I doubt if I will get a job. When I am older I migth come back to England and get another job. The children will be older now, If I do come back to England I will ask mum and dad if they will come back to spain with me.
