I am living a quiet life now, with not much excitement and not too much work. I am a scientist. Once I was very excited for I saw a bacteria I had not even heard of before. But, unfortunately, it had been discovered the day before by another scientist. I am fascinated with rocket engines - in fact, I work with rocket fuels. and I saw the bacillus in it - and sometimes repair them.
At home, I usually stay indoors except after a gale, and when the garden is untidy. Then I go out and repair the garden. Once, when there was the worst gale for ninenty years, I absent-mindidly replaced the flowers so that they looked like a rocket engine. It is strange how ones profession has an impression on ones outside work. Once I had a nasty schock because of this. I was walking home, and someone was showing someone else a film. It was of a first world war film. It was just my luck that I saw a shell exploding. I thought it was a rocket blowing up, and I rushed over A car just missed me by inches. I found that the film was a first world war picture  Words: 204
