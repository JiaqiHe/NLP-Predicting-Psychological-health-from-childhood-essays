"I own 3 horses I Show them at Shows and I like buying horses. But I hate parting with them. I have all So got 4 Labrador* Dogs I like to Show them as well. I like keeping my house clean as well I like to go to the Swimming baths when it is nice and quite because when I was younger big boys would come in and tease people younger than themselves. I don't like anyone who hurts a animal or feeds it badly and treats it badly when I was younger I told a rag and Bone man off because he was pulling the horses rains to tight I Shouted to hine and said ""If you don't stop pulling on that poor horses mouth I will get the R.S.P.C.A. man on to you"". I have a sister she is 5 years older than me So She is 29. My mother and father are very nice to me."  Words: 159
