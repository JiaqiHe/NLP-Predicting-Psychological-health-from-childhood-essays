O often go out and go to many sports like rally cross rugby cricket soccer tennis. My home life is very good and my work is very good to I work at the welding industria in Brighton. I live ten miles out side Briighton the street conditoins are very good we get a road sweeper round every day because of the traffic and crowded streets. I live in a bung*low that is four years old it is a 1976 model. AT work we only work five days a week I am the head off the welding gang letter B group A is run by my friend [male name] [surname] the letter go all the way up to M in each group ther is 12 men they could weld aroot of a car and the wings in less than two minutes. The name of the company is [company name] welding group for 40 years. I have got an auto bus a kind of volks wagon van but only larger and in stead of the 13 horse power of the volks wagon it has 19 horse power and has 15 seats along one side and 15 across the other the rest is normal until you get to the middle it has a kind of a hatch thing that you can open and look out all together it has 17 windows two at the front and back six along each side and one in the roof it can reach speeds of 150 mph and 100 rpm revs per minute. IT costs 1,000 pounds. The weight is 2 tons the engine weight 3/4 of aton alone and it is called a auto bus of now and the further. IT can pull at least 12 off the older volks wagon filled with people.  Words: 298
