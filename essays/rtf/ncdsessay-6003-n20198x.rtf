My name is [female name]. I am a ballet teacher. I have been to collage and taken my exams. Tonight I take my pupils to work on grade three. I have got a little book to show me what to do. All of my pupils have passed so far. Next week they take an exam. Grade three is one of the hardest grade, so I hope that they pass. All of my pupils have got pale blue leotards. During the day I don't take lessons. I work in the public library. It is a very interesting job. Sometimes, when I have the day off, I go out in the country. On Saturday I will be going with some children on a Sunday School outing. We are going to [town]. At [town] we are alowed to go where we like.
Oh well, I suppose I had better get ready for ballet. I also have got a pale blue leotard. I have got pink satin shoes.
I have just arrived. My pianoist is ready, and so are my pupils. I am late. I get changed quickly while the girls are warming up. First of we do plies and other barre exersises. Then we do center exersises.
After all the exersises the girls get changed and go. But the pianois and I stay behind to have some coffee Then I go home.
The next day I got up and went down to have some breakfast. Then I do some house work. 
I havn't got to go to the libary today because it is my day off. I think I will go Bristol to do some shopping. Then I will go to visit my friend.
The day is over and I have got to go to ballet lessons again.  Words: 290
