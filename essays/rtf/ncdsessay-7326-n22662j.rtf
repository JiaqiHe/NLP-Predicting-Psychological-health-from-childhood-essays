When I am 25 years old I would lead a normal life. My interests would be reading good books and looking after my pets. My home life would be very happy. For work I would take up teaching. I would like to teach at an infants school. The class I would like to take would be the baby class. I would like to learn them to read and write. Sometimes if they had been good all day I would let them have games. In games I would learn the children how to skip those which couldn't skip. I should not hit them unless I was forced to. Instead of hitting them I would make them stand in a corner. Sometimes in the afternoon I would read them some stories. If they did mathematics I would not give them hard ones. I would give them mathematics such as one and one, and two and two. In english lessons I should not give them one I would give them a reading book instead of english. I do not think I would give them a lesson on history and geography I think it would be to hard for them. Once every Friday I would let them bring a toy to play with in the afternoon.  Words: 212
