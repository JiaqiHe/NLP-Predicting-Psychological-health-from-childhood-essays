When I am 25 I would go and see my mother every day because she would be qite old and I would have a house of my own and when I went shopping I would call for my mother to come as well because she would be very lonely . and every Sunday I would go for a walk along the beach and when I finished doing the house work and it was raining outside I would maybe not go for my mother to go to the shops I would start to write a book and at Xmas I would go to (place) and buy the family Xmas presants as (place) is a very good shopping center My job is to be acter-***** which are people who look for the passed so you see I would not have much time to do thes things and I would go to other conirys and look for the things maybe the Romans cavemen used such as swords. and when I find things most of them are very valble because acteralchest want to find as much prove of what the people of the passed talk and most inported how they lived as acteralchest are not very sure to have a job like this you would have to go to collage and unerverty thats the live I would like  Words: 224
