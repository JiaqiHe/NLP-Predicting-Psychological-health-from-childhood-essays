I am to be married on the (date) just now there is a lot of preparations to be made. I am leading a very happy and peaceful life with my parents and sister. My sister was married last week. I like going to have my dress fitted but I have to travel quite far to get to the place. I have started working in a boteque. It is not a very interesting job but I will soon be leaving. My feouce has a bank book he is saving up so that we can go to Spain for our honeymoon. We are planing to buy a cottage in the country. I have a niece who is 3 years old I take her to the park and watch her every Monday and Thursday. My feounce is 26 he loves children. Tomorrow we are sending out our invitations. At home I look after the house and cook the meals . I have three brothers who come at 12 o clock and 9 oclock expe*ting a big meal, they work at a building site. I usually go to the library and read a lot , reading keeps me aucupied when I've nothing to do. My house just now is over looking a field I watch the cows and sheep grazing in the grass. I love going to the farmer to get milk, butter and eggs each weak .  Words: 234
