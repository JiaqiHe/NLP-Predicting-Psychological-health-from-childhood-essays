I am married to an American buisinessman whose name is [name] and I am just looking after [name] my youngest brother who is 18 and he is in bed with measels. the doctor will be here in a moment with a certain anesthetic that will put him to sleep for 10 minutes and he will wake and the disease will have gone away. My Uncle [name] is coming down our house tonight in his tubeway* car he wants to know if Dad is going for a Pint down at the New Inn they had just built in [city]. When [name] is better I am going to see a display of Robots. Soon every house in ourr street will be issued with the Robots They get a your breackfast at a time that you set and also they will wake you up and wash up the dishes for you.

      My Home is a new type which is fitted with a number of automatic things. Like for instance ecatators and Robots that do almost every odd job around the house. 
      My main hobby is horse riding I also like a game of golf now and again.
