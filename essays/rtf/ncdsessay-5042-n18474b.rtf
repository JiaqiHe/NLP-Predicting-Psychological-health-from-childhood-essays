Well I would have been married and, I am training at london airport to be a pilot. In the evening's I would go home and be greeted by my wife and then I would have a cup of tea. Then I would watch television, and after I have had my supper I would go to bed. The next morning I would get up, and go to work. I got very angry because I was later for work. The boss told me to go to the cot-pit of the boeing and show me swithes and how things worked. If I did something wrong the boss blew me sky high and throw my out. The things that intrests me our reading, writing, sleeping and sport.
At home I would have trouble and trouble about the, gas, and the electricity and the furniture. The job I do is quite good and, one day I was so happy that I heard that I was old enough to join the flying Corps. I would get in a English electric and fly about the place on patrols and on fighting attacks. I think that I should go and visit my boss once again, just to tell him how I am getting on.
I think that on my 26 birthday, I said to my wife, I would like a new stock of reading books and some magazines about flying.  Words: 230
