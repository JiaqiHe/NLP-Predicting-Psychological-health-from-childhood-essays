I am twenty Five and I hope to own a chemist shop. I sell cosmetics and films ext but the the the thing I like doing best is is makeing a a subscriptions this is not all *** because one slight mistake could poison someone. Reading the doctors writing on the subscriptions is a big Job. My shop is quite big I have two assistants. At Christmas we always sell a lot of spirits. on Christmas eve we stay open longer so people can get there Christmas drinks. My shop is open on Saturday morning aswell as the week day my half day closing is on thursday when I play Golf with my friend. On Saturday morning I tidy the shop up ready for monday which is a busy day because I write all the orderss and records.  Words: 138
