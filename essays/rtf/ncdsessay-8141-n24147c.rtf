I am now twenty-five years old and I am a nurse I look after children whoose parents have died.
There is some sad children that you have to give specail atention to. I look after them in the daytime but in the evenings I teach sports like Bagmington , tenis , swimm-ing. I live in a estate which is quite far from the orphangge . Sometimes I take the children walks and picnics. This is a story about a little girl that I had to look after . When she came in she looked awful sad , her mother was ill and her father was dead. She would not play with the other children. It was near christmas and I went to see her mother* in hospital. The doctor said she would not recover unless she knew her **** was happy. So I decided that when father christmas came I would take a picture and would send it to her mother. On christmas eve I woke her up and took a picture of father christmas and her , she smiled hard because I told her that her mother was happy. I sent the picture to her mother and she recovered soon. On chrismas morning at the party she played with the other children.  Words: 212
