When I am 25 I would like to have finished training to be a teacher and have two girls who's names would be Jacqueline and dine. I would go back to teaching when they started school and teach the little ones in their first class at school. At home I would do the housework then start the dinner and in the afternoons when it is sunny I would go for a walk with my children to the park. I would like to live in **** because I have lived in it all my life and I like living here. I would all so like to teach in this school and my children to go to this school because my mother went to it. I would also like to teach country dance to the children in the school and after school aswell. I have wanted to become a teacher since I was little and just started school. I would like to teach small children because I like small children and they are easyer to look after. I would not like to teach just boys or just girls, I would like to teach both sorts.
