I am a nurse and I work in a hospital for children. My interests are ice stating, sking, and dress making all these I do in my spare time. The hospital where I work is in London it is very interesting working in a childrens hospital, it is a new hospital and has only been built 9 months. Some times I like to watch football my favorate football team is Manchester United. My two favorite footballers are Bobby Charlton and George Best. I live in the nurses homes I have a lot of friends mostl of them are nurses. Sometimes when I do not have to work and have a hoilday I go home to stay with my mum and dad they live in [town] which is in Gloucestershire. when I go home it is very quiet because its in the countryside and makes a change from London with the busy traffic and all the noise of the town. [town] as changed very much since I was little. I enjoy my work very much.  Words: 174
