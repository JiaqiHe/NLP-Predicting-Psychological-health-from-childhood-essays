When I am 25 years old I want to be a footballer. My interests are where I am going to live, what I am going to do in my spare time. If I possible can I will try to get near a football ground. So if I get in a football club I can go to early training. If I get in a football club. On Sundays I will watch the television. On sunday there is usally football on The Big Match. Another interest of mine is weather I can play for a first division. if not I will try to get in a fourth divison club like [football club]. When I am not playing football I will try to get a job. A job like Selling in a sweetshop. When I am at home I will do Some house work. If I get into fourth divison football I want to play at centre forward, and I will try to score as many goals as I can. Before a match starts I get all tenced up because you have to face a big crowd. you have to be a good footballer to be famous. They hardest part in football is in the F.A.Cup because your team goes all out to win. If you reach the final you play at the famous ground which is wembly stadium. [football club]s ground is near the sea front. I will try to be a good footballer.  Words: 242
