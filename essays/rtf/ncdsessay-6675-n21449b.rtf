I am now a vet it is a very hard working job but also very intresting. I am sitll intrested in bird watching and opend some of my spare time doing so. I live in a small cottage I have a friend who lives wiht me we both are vets and share much the same interests. We Have some animals being a cat or two dogs and a canary because we have different working hours we can help one and other. On Sundays we both have a day off and often we spend the day rather la*ily. Sometimes I take the dogs over to a farmer I know and my friend and i go shopping. On my working days I got and recive instructions from a person who gives me different work to do. Often I deal with sick cats and dogs or the farm animals. When i get home at about 1 o clock my friend has made the dinner for me because she has shorter work in the morning. When I have got some more money I hope to get married. Our cottage has only two bedrooms, one bathroom a sitting room and a large ****** ** in which we put a basin so it **** is now a ki**en .  Words: 213
