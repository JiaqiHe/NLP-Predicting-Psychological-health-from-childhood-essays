When I am 25 my hobbies will be football, cricket, rugby union and all other kinds of sports. My work I hope will be a proffessional footballer for Stoke City F.C. When I retire from proffessional football I hope that I will be working in some kind of office. My home life at the age of 25 will be very good,I will treat my wife and children lovingly. The life I will be leading I hope will be good. In the summer when the football season is over, I will have plenty of interests at home,I will try to make the home modern by decorating the house once a month. Some other interests in the summer when the football season is over will be drawing, reading, collecting cards and sometimes stamps.  Words: 131
