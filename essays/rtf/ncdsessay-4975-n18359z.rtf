I am now 25 years old. I am a pilot. I fly a jumbo jet for Woarld Airways. I live just outside of Manchesterrx Manchester. I often go to see footfall matches at Maine Road and Old Trafford I often fly all over the woarld. I aim to be captain of a jumbo jet or Concorde. I am not married yet. I like watching planes takeing off and landing. In my spare time I watch aeroplanes at Ring Road. Manchester airport. Gander aerport is the best I think* because there are not many people there and it has its own muesuim. Toronto airport and Manchester are always crowed, even at nights. When you check in at an airport, some of the other pilots you have never seen. The crew is always different. I hardly ever fly on short flights, they are always long ones to forieghn countries. I often fly to Australia America, Africa and Canada. I have hardly ever fx been into Russia. I know some routes off fx by hearte but some others I don't know until I look at a mqx map. I like being a pilot.  Words: 190
