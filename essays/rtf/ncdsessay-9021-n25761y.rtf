When I am 25 years old I would like to have a house of my own. And for a job I would like to be a footballer or a Athlete I would like to be a footballer or an Athlete because you would be fit. I would not like to smoke but if I had alot of money I would like to get a car. I would like to get marrid. And I would like to emergrate to another country because I would like to live in a better country and see new places and new things. If I did get a house of my own I would like it to be in the country or in a small town. I would ratehr be a athlete more than a footballer I think because I would like to train and run long distances about five miles and run in short distance ones as well. I would like to breed dogs if I had a chance I would breed labradors and try and train them.  Words: 173
