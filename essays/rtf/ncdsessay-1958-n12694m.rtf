"I am going in the navy. I want to be an engineer. I like fixing things. I also like wathing* and mending* complecating* things like modern machinery and things like that Today I am going to start training. First thing we did after breakfast was report to the gym. I like physical education. We had to climb up ropes, go a long poles, do press ups pratice with our muscules. After I had finished in the gym I had to go to the swimming baths. I heard that you have to swim at least twenty lengths, ""get changed at the double"" shouted the instructor, we all ran to the changing rooms double quick.
After I had jumped in swimming bathes the instructor ordered us to swim ten lengths. one of the boys in the bath could not swim a yard but he could float a mile. He told me when he was little he used to go out in the tide and let the wind bring him in a gain. I swam* my ten lengths and just as I got back a gain he ordered me to do a nother ten lengths. What a struggle it was!
But I finaly reached the side. from then onward I hated doing the breath stroke. I could do the crawl, the backstroke, and the butterfly. I could also dive I had won a lot of medals for diving. 
He ordered us to float I didnt know how to float but the boy who could do nothing but float showed me how to do it. He told me to to fill my self up with air. I learnt well at swimming. and when I went in the navy I was. the best swimmer on the ship!"  Words: 290
