I go to college 5 days a week and come home every day. I am studing History and Maths and English. In the Break times we have at college I usaully read a book or copy out some important notes from a lecture. Occasionally I go to a dance with my Boyfriend and stay up till about 1 o'clock. My interests are reading andembroidery. When I come home at night I usaully copy out notes about a lecture that I did not have time to do at college. After that I sit down and watch the television or do the ironing for mother. At the weekends I might go for a ride in my car or v**it a friend. Otherwise I help with the housework and get tea. I might ocasionally go riding some saturday mornings also.  Words: 137
