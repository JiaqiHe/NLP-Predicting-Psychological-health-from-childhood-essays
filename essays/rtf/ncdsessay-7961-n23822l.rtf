Money was running short so I decided to get a job, my frirst step was what kind of job. My freind did moddling. I asked her what kind of job moddling was, clothed seemed to intrested me very much so I decided to take the job up. I was told to be at a sertain place at 2 o'clock. I went by bus as I had not yet past my driving test. I arrived there at 2.50. My first step was to unpack some clothes wich had gust be deliverd, then I was told to put on some dresses, it was very exciting puting on and takeing of clothes wich you had never worn before. At 5 o'clock I was told there was no more to do, so I caught my bus and went home. It was that night I was aked to babysit wich I liked very much looking after children. The next morning I cleaned the house and decided to go out shoping, where I bought my self a dress and a hat with the money I owend for moddling.  Words: 182
