I am now 25. I am a teacher. The children get out of hand sometimes, and make it a diifficult job. Many people don't know what a hard life it is as a teacher. I go home every night and just flop down into a chair. I've just about had enough of it
      At school in the morning try to take the register but most people don't listen for their names.
      My main interest is teaching the children how to swim. I also like reading.
      Play ground and dinner duty are my main problems. Especially playground. The things that go on, the fights the screams and shouts are enough to drive any one round the bend. 
      There are quiet moments when the reading and story periods are on. There are thirty children in my class. The lesson I hate taking is maths. Everyone seems restless and most don't understand.  Words: 150
