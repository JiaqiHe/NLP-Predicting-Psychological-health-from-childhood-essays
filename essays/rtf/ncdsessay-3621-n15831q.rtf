My name is [name] and my age is twenty Five. I lead a very plesant life and get along well with my friends. I used to be a scecutary but am now an air-hostess which I like being very much. I would never go back to working in an office if I could help it. I like being an air hostess because I like traveling to other countries. Before I was an air-hostess I had never flown before but I like it very much. I work for an air-line called [company]. They do all the charter flights for [company] and [company] tours. We have a Scarlet uniform with a white blouse and a blue pillbox hat. I have not been with [company] for long but I have been to many differant countries, but the one I liked best was Tunis which is in north Africa. When I am at home I go out a lot to lunch with my friends. I like swimming very much and can swim quite far. i also like watching coughball which is a cross between basketball and netball. My sister plays for a team called [team]. I have two sisters which are older than I am and one is married. I also have a pet cat which is very mischivious and gets up to all sorts of naughty tricks. Whien I was young I used to go to Brownies and Guides. We did all sorts of interesting things there including camping at [village] and going on hikes. I enjoyed myself very much there.  Words: 258
