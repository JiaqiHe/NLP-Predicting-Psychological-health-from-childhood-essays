Hello my name is [first name]. I have been married for four years and I have a child (girl) 3 yrs old. In the morning at half past eight I set off to [illegible fiche - the] nursery with my little girl Wendy. She is in the nursery from 9am-3pm and gets her dinner there. I start work at 9.30 so I go straight from the nursery. I work from 9.30 to 1.20. I work in an office and enjoy my work very much. The people I work with are very nice and at 10.30 someone makes a cup of tea. We take it in turns. My interests are very simple. I love to sit down and read a book but alas the only time I can do that is when I have got Wendy safely into bed. When I come into the house after my work at about 2pm. I tidy up and clean all the rooms. This takes me till 2.30 then I have to go and collect Wendy from the nursary. We get home about 3.30 and then I [illegible fiche - start] to make the tea. We have it at 5.30 when my husband comes in. At 6.30 I wash Wendy and a 7o'clock she goes to bed. At last it is my favourite time when I can sit and relax with a book. THE END  Words: 230
