I am 25 married and live in a quaint little cottage. I work in a shop and do house work. I started work at 9-00 and finished at 6-00 with an hour for lunch. There are not many people in the village so the shop is not very busy I read a lot so i don't often get bored. My home life is spent cooking ore* cleaning and rarely relazing*. The time when I do relax* is spent reading. I sew many of my clothes. I enjoy talking to the villagers as they spread so many superstisions. Another helper in the shop is very fussy about the floure being washed every day and every shelf washed daily. I watch the children play on saturdays and after school hours. The joyous voices enchant me. My husbands job is photography. I have a daughter who serves in the shop from time to time butnever uses the till. My life is full so I never sit in the garden I love. My parents live 15 miles away I see them every week in *********. I enjoy my life tremendous by*.  Words: 187
