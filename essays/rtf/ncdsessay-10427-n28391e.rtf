It all started as another ordinary day the alarm rang and I sat up wiping the sleep from my eyes and arose slowly out of bed. About five minutes later I walked slowly down the stairs fully dressed but still a bit drowsy I opened the kitchen door and walked in. Two munutes there was a lovely smell of bacon and eggs in the air I sat down and began to eat my breakfast but then I looked at my watch* and saw the time it was quarter to eight quickly I tidied up and set off to work. It was half past eight when I arrived at work I am a forman at the British [male name] [surname] everybody was busy working I walked round and helped the other men out of their difficulties before I went for a cup of tea. When I got home that night I was tired out so I went and sat down and read my paper.  Words: 163
