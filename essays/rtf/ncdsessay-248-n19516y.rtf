I am twenty five years old and I am a train driver and I am very interested in planes and their making. My home is very big and I have a large garden in which I have rose trees and tulips. I get up at six oclock in the morning because it is a long drive to the depot. When I reach there I put on my train driver hat and get onboard the train and go to the first station. At night when I go home I turn on the television and whatch it for a while then go to my first meal of the day in the dining room. When it is finished I take my pet dog for a walk, he is an alsation and he stands two feet six inches off the ground. I go to bed at nine o'clock because I have to get up very early. On saturdays I have a day off from work but I have a part time jod at a car factory it is a very hard jod. On saturday nights I go to a billard room where the members play each other. Model planes are a hobby. I buy two every weekend to have something to do this weekend I bought a spitfire and BOAC jet. On Sunday I go to church.  Words: 223
