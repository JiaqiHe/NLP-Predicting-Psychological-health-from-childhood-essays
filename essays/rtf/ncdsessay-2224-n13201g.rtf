"I am now twenty-five years old. I work at Plymouth Zoo, feeding (mostly) the lions and tigers etc. and looking after them. I am chief worker here and have a little wooden hut down by the main entrance. In the evennings I often draw animals in the zoo and paint them, I have sold one or two to my friends but I prefer to keep them and my hut is covered from floor to cieling with them. I am not married yet and I hope to stay single unless I find someone who is fond of animals and wants to work in the zoo. I am going to Africa next week and hope to stay there five years as assistant fame warden in a wildlife reserve. I do most of th jobs around the zoo (as well as looking after the lions), espesily the dangerous ones. Although I have never been to America I am rather like a cowboy in the way I dress with my hat, leather jacket and boots and you would think my hut came strait out of a wild west story! Everybody calls me ""[male name]"" as a nickname and only people who are not my friend call me [female name]. I do not get very high wages but it is enough for me to eat and keep my hut. I have many animal encyclopedias and have knowledge of almost every animal especily lions. I enjoy work in the zoo and would not be as happy anywhere else."  Words: 252
