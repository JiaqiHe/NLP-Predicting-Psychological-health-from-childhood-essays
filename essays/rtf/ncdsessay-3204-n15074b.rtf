"I am now an actress in Australia. It is very interesting work as you meet many people who for all you know be gone the next day. On Saturday mornings I help my friend at her shop and in the afternoon do whatever pleases me. I have been in one Western so far called ""The devil's Gonna Catch Ya"". I was Maria the girl the devil was after. The devil was a man who was after me because my so called husband (who was now dead) killed his son in a war. Naturally I didn't where a Mini Skirt!
Another film I was in was a comedy romance called 'You Love Me, You Love Me Not' I wuldn't tell you about this even if you blew-up.
Now I will tell you something* about* the place and being on television. I get a chance at seeing my self act because they* usually show the film about 1 week later. The studio is* never inside when a western is being done unless there are no vast spaces to cover which is very rare. They always have more than one television camera and at least one that can go up and down. The people who work the television programmes in the studio have controls and switches which they operate to give the people watching a better view."  Words: 222
