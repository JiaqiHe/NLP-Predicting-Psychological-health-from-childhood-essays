I am leading a happy life and I have got a Bungalow with a wife 2 children and we have got a golden labrador.
I have a good job being a footballer and I get quite a bit of money and I take my children up to watch me on a saturday and we hey back home about 12 o'clock at night.
We have a car and we usually go in the country or on the beach in the summer and sometimes we stay there all day and when the tide goes out we get our spades and go and make a big paddling pool then we go home about 6 o'clock and have tea then watch tv.  Words: 116
