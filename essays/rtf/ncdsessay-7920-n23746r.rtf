At the age of 25 I would be a student nurse I would be studing all names of bones and all parts of the body. I would live in a flat. Very often I would take my dog which would be called Lassie to the park. I would passmy driving exam. I like my work very much. Sometimes if I would have enough money I would be traveling to some outher countries for my holidays. Sometimes I would take my pet dog with me. But sometimes I would stay at home Lassie would always like playing with me. I would love my dog and I would be carefu. just incase it spreaded germs in my house I would wash it very carefully I woud wash it very well and always keep it tidy. If my dog would be sick I would take it to the very strate away, so that it would not get worst. I would aid my paisiants carefully.  Words: 161
