I workin a bank and it is a very hard job. I go from country to country on important business deals. I live with my mum and dad and in my spare time I might have a game of football with the lads. In the evenings I go to dances or a club. I am thinking about getting a other job because the job in the bank is hard and very long hours. I might get a job as a postman, and deliver letter from door to door. and I am also thinking of getting married. This is the life I would wwant to have.  Words: 105
