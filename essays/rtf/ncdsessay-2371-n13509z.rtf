My work is a vet. I enjoy it a lot because I like animals very much , especially horses and dogs. I go to work very early in the morning and sometimes I am called out very early to see to sick animals. I live in a quite large house. In my spare time when I half no calls or patients I either read a book or collect up all my foreign dolls and tidy them up . I have quite a large selection of foreign dolls . At night in my spare time I either go to the Cinema or to a dance , with my friends. I have 2 dogs. One is a mongrel (half-spaniel , half-labrador) and the other is a pedigree poodle . My surgeon is fairly large . and mostly my patients are domestic pets , like dogs , cats, hamsters and so on . I do not finish work until fairly late at night . My interests are riding and collecting the dolls I try to go to the stables any possible time I can.  Words: 181
