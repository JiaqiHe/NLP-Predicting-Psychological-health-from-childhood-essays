I am very interested in animals and I am a vet . it is very interesting being a vet because you find out a lot about animals one day I had to take a monkeys tooth out and the monkey nearly bit my hand of but eventually I got it out by giving the monkey a picture book to look at . My mother and father are getting on fine and they often come up to see me and my pets wich are a monkey , a dog, a parrot and a very small shetland pony wich lives in a field behind my house . My brothers and sister often come up with their children to see me and the children play with the animals in the house if it is cold and wet and if it is warm and dry they take them for a walk or they have a ride on the shetland pony . I sometimes do my work in the house or at the back of the pet shop my sister owns, when I said the children take the animals for walks I did not mean the parrot. I do not just have my own poets in the house, sometimes I have to take other people's pets in if they are very ill and work over night with them , and when i have finished with them I put them in a small spare cot I have (wich is the monkeys ) and put it beside the fire to keep them warm then in the morning the owners come and collect them and take them home.
