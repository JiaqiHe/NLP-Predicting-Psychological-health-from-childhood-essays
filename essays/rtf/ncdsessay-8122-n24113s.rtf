The life I am leading at the moment now I am 25, my job is a holticulturist, which is something to do with flowers. My interests are swimming, horse riding, and flowers. The work is quite easy now I have the hang of it, where I am working is a very nice place. when I am at home I often bring cuttings of flowers for Grandma, to plant and they usually come up into flowers. My sister is going to be a teacher, in two years time. My mother, and father, and my sister, and my self, Still live together, but often [name] has to go to university or to college so sometimes she is not at home. Father has retired, Grandma is living in a flat, we visit her twice a week. I start work at nine and finish about half past five.  Words: 144
