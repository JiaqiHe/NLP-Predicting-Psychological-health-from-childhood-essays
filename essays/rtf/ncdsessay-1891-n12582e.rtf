I would a large house of a farm but not to large that it took far to long to clean. I would bathe in the river every other day once on most of the hot days I whould teach my daughter to swim. I would especially like to have a shetlarce* pony called shandy for my daughter, my husband to house a horse called Sunny Bay and I would liek to have a grey pony large called Billiam. I should have a few parties, especially in a summer evening doen by the river. I would like to have a few of my neighbours round in the afternoon to talk to and if they had young children to bring them round also.
