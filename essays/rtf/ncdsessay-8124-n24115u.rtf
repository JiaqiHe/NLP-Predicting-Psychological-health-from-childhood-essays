I am married with two children. They are twins, one is a girl and one is boy, they are four years old. I what to be a midwife, but I still have two years of my nursing course to do. My to children go to a school near where we live. We live in a house on my Huband fram. My mother and father also live with us. When I am not at the nures collage I work on the farne.
      I also run a club. Which nearly all of the women of my village belong to. We do all sorts of things. Last year we visted four interestding places. One of the place we went to was a camping start*. It was a dis*** from the beging. First of all we missed the bus and the train.
      Then when we got there it poured with rain. Then we found we had not got a tin opener. Most of our food was tin even some of our drinks we. So one of the women ran two miles to the nearest shop to by a tin opener.
      One of my favrite hobbies is rideing my horse tunder. We have won many contest together. In my living room there are many torhies and shields.  Words: 212
