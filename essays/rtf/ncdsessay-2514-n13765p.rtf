I would very much like to work on a farm in the country, and own horses and ride them. I don't really want to get married because I think that once you are married. one cannot do the things which one wanted to do. Because of looking after the children and mending the husbands shirt button, which has come off. My intrests are caring for animals, (mainly horses) But I would like my mother to be on my farm as well.  Words: 81
