I have just turned 25 and I am leaving home to buy a house with my friends in [town]. I go to the beach nearly every day and go out to the fair at night or to clubs. Next day my friends got me a job where she works as an Air hostess. First time I travel from [town] to Irland I got sick but later on I got used to it. After I left the job and I went home to see my mom and Dad. I went back to [town] and joinded the St Johns ambulance brigade. I worked there for five years. Then the head nurse asked me did I want to Join the hospital and become a nurse. I started and I done nights and slept in the day time that is where I work now.  Words: 140
