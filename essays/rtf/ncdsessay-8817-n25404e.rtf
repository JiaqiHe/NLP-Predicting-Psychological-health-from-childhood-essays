I am Leading quiet a happy life. When I grow up or when I am 25, I would like to be an artist. My Best Hobby is Drawing. If I cant Be an Artist I would like to be a hairdresser. I would like to do lot's of different Hairstyles. I'm 25 now. I am married and have got lots of children. I am living in an old fashioned country House. I am still a hairdresser and would like to go to westend and do film-Stars Hair. I would now like to become famous and go painting's like Tom gainsborough. I think mine are now better than the Blue Boy. My husband is Luvley. He works in the garage he is mad on cars. My son is 3. He takes after my husband in his way's. He is also mad on car's. I have 7 daughters. Each one is a year older. 1 year old. She is Lazy and Just suck's her thumb 2 year old. She is tremendously noisy. she screeches. 3 year old. She is quiet and follows me everywhere I go. 4 year's old. Now this one is in between, she shouts when she's on her own. She is shy when she isnt. I am going on to my precious garden. I grow vegtables and flowers. I am Lucky really arent I.  Words: 225
