I am twenty-five I live in **** I like it very much there, as it is a sweet village. 
     I work as a secretary on the outskirts of Cambridge. I enjoy my job very much and in my spare time (which is'nt very often a I have a baby girl) I go for long walks with my baby in her pram. 
     I like cooking and bake wedding and christening cakes etc. for a small charge I also like sewing and knitting very much. So in the evenings I am kept busy sewing and knitting my mother and father live quite near so I go to see them quite a lot. 
     I enjoy my life a lot although it is often very busy. 
     My mother looks after Sarah (the baby) while I am at work.  Words: 138
