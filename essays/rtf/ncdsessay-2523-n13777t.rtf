I would like to be marryed and be happy and would like to do housework and not go out to work. I would like to live in a nice little house not very far away from aleast one relation. I would like to be able to do many out door things to do with sport. I would like to in a netball team or join a sports club. I would like to have children. When my husband learnt to drive I wounld like something like a sports car with an open roof. I would like to have pets. An Aisasian, black and brown. I wounld have it trained and take it for long runs and make quite sure his life would be a happy one. We would have a big garden with flowers around the egde and gorgeous green grass in the middle. We have a swing for our children and a trye or something much the same for our dog. I would like my husband to belong to a football or cricket team so I could go and watch him play. I would like my husband to like sport aswell. Not only would I like a dog but many other animals. I wounld like a tabby cat and other little things like hamsters and I would like a little pond at the end of the garden to put some fish in.  Words: 232
