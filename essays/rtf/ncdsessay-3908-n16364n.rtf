When I am 25 years old rite now I would be working at work. I would be a postman because my Father is a postman. I don't like been shut up in a office all day. I would drive a motor bieck. Sending letters to peoples houses. I would go all over the streets and I would go fast. When I get home I would have a big meal and sit down to settle it. At 25 years old I suppose I will be marred. I would have a nice house with a big fireplace with alot of shelfs. I would have nice wallpaper on the walls and a fishtank in the corner of the room in the middle of the room I would have a huge sofure. And at the sides of the room a big window with a table under it. I would go out into the garden and paint my garage white and red. I would get a ladder and my paint and start to paint the top of the garrag red and the doors red. Then I would paint the sides of the garrag white and the back of the garrage white.
