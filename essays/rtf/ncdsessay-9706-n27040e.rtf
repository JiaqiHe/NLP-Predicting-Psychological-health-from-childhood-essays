"'A.HH! what a crisp morning as it is"". I wandered along the aeoro.strip wondering wheather it'll be all right. This morning I felt quite jumpy for the first time in my whole life I was going to investigate a mysteireous phernominem of a man*. You might have guest I'm a police sargent. As I reached the old dilpidated, vintege barn. I thought who could be the phantom there was two crooks escaped one profesor phantom the mystierious dick. it fitted it just might be them. I can hear something its a secret panel in the rotted wood. I just dont now what to do I'll go inside. at first I hesitaded but then carefully pushed at the barn rotted wood pannel's it slowly opened. helP! I've fell into a trap. When I regained conshoisness I found they had tied me up. It was them they had been sending robot's to peoples houses and stealing their riches. I looked around and saw the guard asleep I quickly slipped a flick knife out of my pocket and cut my ropes. I ammeidietly ran to the door where I called a group of constables we figured we'll burn them out and out they come and a loud exsplotion echoed around the city. Then proffesor and dick were sentence'ed to fifteen year's imprisonment. we've saved the day."  Words: 223
