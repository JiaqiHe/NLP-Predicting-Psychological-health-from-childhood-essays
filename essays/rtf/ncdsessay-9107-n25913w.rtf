I am now 25 years old. I work as a veterinary surgeon but I prefer domestic animals to wild ones. I live just outside the farm. In my spare time I do shooting and sailing. I like my work because I like making animals better. I am married and have two children, John and Simon. There is always plenty to do at home, at weekends I usually help with the children or do some gardening. Sometimes we all go out to the cinema together, or go shopping in London. We have a car, a Rove 2000, in which we travel a lot. We usually go out together but* sometimes we get a baby-sitter into look after the children. I am leading a happy life, but sometimes the farmer who I work for gets very cross with me and I come home feeling rather upset. When that happens, i go for a walk in a nearby wood. This wood has a str*am running through it and it is nice to sit on the banks of the stream and listen to the niose of the water. It makes me feel much better. But that hardly ever happens.
