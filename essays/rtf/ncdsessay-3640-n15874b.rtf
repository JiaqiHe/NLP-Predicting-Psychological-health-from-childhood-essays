Id have certain hobbees like fishing or ice skating. if I have the money I will live in a big house and have a sports car. I will go on as many holidays I could afford, And eat as much as I could afford. I hope I grow to be big and strong. I will have about 3 dogs. A alsation a greyhound and a bull mastiff. Really I will have a lot of pets. And have a lovely garden. If I dont be a rugby player I will try and be an arcitect. They earn 50 to xxxx100 a week. But it is a very skilled job. The draw plans of houses how they are going to be built and if the ground is even enough for the house to be built on. He disighns all different kinds of houses. It is a very good job really. But it requires a lot of trining and patience. But the day still has to come. When I'm really started on my job and earning money.  Words: 217
