The next class I take is at 11. 30 till 12.00. Dinner time is at 12. 30 so in the half an hour wait I do things like writing letters. I take two more classes then its home time. I leave school at 4. 30. Then I go home just before my children arrive from there aunties house. I make the tea watch the television for a bit then put the children to bed at 8. 00. I then sit and think what gym I can use for the next day. I go to bed at 10. 30 ready for the next day.  Words: 187
