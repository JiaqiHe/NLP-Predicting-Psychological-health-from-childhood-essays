I now twenty five years old, and am married with no children. My husband comes home at six o' clock. In the morning I get up at half past eight. My husband leaves for work at nine o' clock. When I am dressed I started the daily chores. First if there is any ironing to do, I do that. On a Monday I do the washing, then I wash up the breakfast things. After I have finished I hoover and dust the whole house. At about eleven o' clock I start preparing lunch, today I think we will have stewed steak an dumplings. I must go down to the shops and buy some peas and potatoes and various other things. When I arrive home I must remember to put the iron away, then I must put the steak in a casserole. Today we shall have apple crumble for a sweet. We shall have dinner at one thirty. I think I will lay the table now and dish up the dinner. After lunch I must wash-up and clear away, then I will put the kettle on because our next door neighbour is coming round for a cup of tea, at about half past five I will start getting the tea ready for when my husband comes home. Tonight I shall cook him Welsh Rabbit, then I shall put my feet up and watch television.  Words: 233
