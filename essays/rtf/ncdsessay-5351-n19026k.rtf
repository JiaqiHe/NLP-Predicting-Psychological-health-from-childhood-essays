Now I am 25 I hope to be married. And I hope to have a family of about three. When my children have settled down at School I hope to have a good carrier ahead of me. I would like a part time job. I would like to be a nurse. I am in training for it. I like doing the house work. I also like reading books from the library.  Words: 71
