I am 25 years old and I enjoy life. I lead a very happy life and often go out and about. I am a happy girl with many friends to go about with. I am a vet and look after animals. I have many animals in vet. dogs, cats, hamsters and many more. I earn xxxx38 a week and I usually buy things for myself but I am saving up for a vet for myself. I have a mini car that I usually take people out in. Myself I would prefer a vauxhall but my mother says vauxhalls are far to big. But one day I will get one. In my spare time I do housework for my mother because she is not able to get around as good as she used too. Another thing I like is stamp collecting. I have many stamps Austrailian, German, French, Spanish and a lot more. I have travelled all over the world and saw many animals Actually I was on an animal course I have been to the U.S.A. Spain, France*, Belguim Italy all of the places The most interesting place I went to was on an African Safari. and I set up camp and studied many animals in the compound*. Once a monkey that I kept there was very ill and I helped him and he recovered. I am as you know very interested in animals and I think I will continue till I am an old age pensioner I think then I hope to be rich and buy alot of animals and live in a big house in the country*.
