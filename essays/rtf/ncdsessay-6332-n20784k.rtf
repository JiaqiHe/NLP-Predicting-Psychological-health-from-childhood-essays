When I grow up and get married I am going to buy a bunglow for I do not want a house and I will go out to work I will do a cleaning job till I find a job I am interesting in and when I have children I would like a boy and girl I would like them to be twins and when my children are about two year old I would go on a holiday somewhere nice where the children could play happy while I had a good time I think the best place would be Butlins because the people look after your children while you go out to dancing and places like that I would Call my Children if I had a boy and girl [name] and [name] because I like those names best.
