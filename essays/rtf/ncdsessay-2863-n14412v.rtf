Now I am 25 I will try and get myself a part time job. I am not married yet so I have a small cottage just big enough for me and if someone comes to stay there will be enough room. My home is in the countryside so I have plenty of chances to watch wild animals. The job I got myself is a assitant to a person who mixes 300 animals food. I take the ingredients to the cook who prepares it and then take the food to the keeper who then gives it to the animals and birds. Then after I have washed up the saucepans and dishes I go home. When I reach home I tidy up and wash dirty clothes. After that I walk half-a-mile to the shops, do my shopping and walk back. Many wild animals stray on to the road if there are no human beings about. By the time I get home it is time to go to the zoo again for the midday feeding time. When I get back home I usually do the ironing if it is dry. Sometimes in the afternoon I go into town to get anything I have forgotten, or to look round the shop windows. In the evenings, when it is quite dark, many badgers and foxes come close to the cottage and accept titbits I put out for them. This is a very good time for studying animals  Words: 242
