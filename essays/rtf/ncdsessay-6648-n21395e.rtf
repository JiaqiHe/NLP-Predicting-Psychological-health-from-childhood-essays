"      My name is [name], I am twenty five years old and live in [city]. I have a job in a solicitor's office but I hope beocme a solicitor my self in a couple of years. I live in a flat in [park], which I share with a friend of mine, [name], She and I have lived together for 2 years. I go out nearly every night as I am a member of the ""Round Table"" and we have allways got some event taking place, but I will soon have to leave the ""Round Table"" because I will take up nearly all my spare time studying to become a solicitor. I find working in a solicitor's office very interesting work, people come to us with all kinds of problems such as ""how can we have a divorse"" and ""will you be my solicitor in court"" and allso they come to use asking about money.
      I am looking fore want very much for November because I am going to be a bridesmaid in [name]'s sister's wedding. 
      All together I lead a very interesting life!"  Words: 184
