I am leading an intresting life. I have a bungalow on the outskirts of **** and a nice garden at the back which I try to work when I've got the time. I travel a lot abroad on buisness but mostly just sightseeing. Every saturday afternoon when I have'nt got annything to do I go to football matches up in London. My work is an Architect I have a big buisness in **** planning new houses and other things in my spare time I like making boats and aeroplanes which I sometimes fly or sail in races. Sometimes I go swimming or maybe I go along to a river and fish. I hold a lot of partys in the evenings to celobrate something In a week maybe I will have to travel up to newcastle or maybe down to penzance if so I somtimes stay on a few days extra. I belong to an Ametar Football club and the position I play is centre half. 
I rent one of the bedrooms in the bungalow because it keeps me company I lead a very nice life and I would'nt swap it for anything.  Words: 192
