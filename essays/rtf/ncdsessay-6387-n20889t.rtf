"I feel I am unable to write about ""When I am 25"" because I don't know what I would like to be now and by the time I am 15 my mind will have changed completely and by the time I am 25 my mind will be even more changed. I tried to think what I would like to be but I just didn't know what to write about and what I would like to be. I have never had the thought in my mind of ""what I would like to be."" Maybe in a few years time I will know what I would like to be but now I dont know."  Words: 112
