I work for the city council as a surveyor. The main interest in the is the immense varity of jobs that can be done. As an example, last week a new council estate was planned, and the main access road would go straig though a farm. The owner raised no objection untill two dairy cows were killed by a ten-ton lorry. The next job was to decide where the houses would go.
My main hobby is building model railways. I have becomemore interested since I won a gold meadel at the Norfolk Railway Society. With the garden railway I have got a 48 wheeled wagon which I use for carrying my tools from the shed to whereever I am. I am now working on a device that tells me when the phone rings  Words: 132
