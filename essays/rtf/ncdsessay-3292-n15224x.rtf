I would have a job and a small bungalo in a village or town, and would probably have a scootor or motor bike, or even a bicycle to go to work on I do not think I would get married. I would get up at about 6.30, get my breakfast, (from the shopping the night before) Pack my lunch, have a wash and shave, wash the dishes, then get ready for work. I would then go out, lock all windows and doors and then off to work When I come back I would go to the shops and then put my dinner on the cooker, then dust around the house come back to the kitchen and eat my dinner. Then carry on dusting I would then sit down and watch the T.V. and go to bed at about 9.30. When I get my pay I will put it away for the shopping and put some away for clothes etc. (and some away for tax, bills, etc) I will probably be interested then, what I am interested in now (stamps, painting). I don't know what my job will be.  Words: 188
