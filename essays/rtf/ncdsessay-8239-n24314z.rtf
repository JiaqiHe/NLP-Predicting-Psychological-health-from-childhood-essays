I am 25 years old. I am interesting in nursing. I work at all different times. I think it is a nice job. But if you had children it would be difficult to look after them. If I was not on duty in the evenings I would go out some where. If i was not working over the week-ends or holidays that the little children had of from school I would take them out. But before I took them out I would get the work done in the house. I would do shoping nearly every day. I would try to help the children looking niece and clean where every they went. I would come an get the children from school if I had time. If i didn't have time I would ask a naybour to get them when they get there children. I would take care of them.  Words: 148
