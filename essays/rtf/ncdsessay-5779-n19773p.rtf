If I where 25 years old I would cary on my farthers job. I would be an upholster and repar chairs and, hang certains up and lay carpets and cut them out.
I could see things around the cuntryside and lay carpets in big houses.
I would get 30 to axxxx1000 a week it is an exiting job and I do like it.
I have seen rabirs and deer in some gardens showing up flowers. Iv lerned how to drive a ford transit ortermatic. I see importent peopl and lots of the welthea peopl dont like spending money. My brother works in the shop too 
I let my friends work at the shop but they only* work partime. They have ten pounds* a week and the work* 12 hours a week.  Words: 128
