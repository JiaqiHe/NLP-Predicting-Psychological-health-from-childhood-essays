----------------------
I am now 25 nearly 26 and I live in London with my husband and two children. I go to night school 3 nights a week and I train digs the other 4 nights. In the morning I always do the house-work and in the afternoon I take [female name] to Nursery school but as [male name] is still a baby he just sits in his pram all day, unless I am going out, then he comes with me. [female name] is 3 and a big girl at that. [male name] just loves being very, very, naughty. (sometimes I wish I could get rid of him). Soon I will be 26 and I am going to have a super party with all my old school friends.
I have a very, very happy time at home. We are not rich but on the other hand we're not poor. I sometimes feel that if I won a lot of money I wouldn't spend it. I'll put it all in the bank. About once a month I go in to the country with my family and the last time we went, we went to [village]. (and had a jolly good time). I have got a Morris Oxford so I drove down to [village].
When I train dogs for 4 nights a week I meet lots of new faces but as its in London we have to do it in a hall (and things get rather messy).
I love my home and my family and if I lost any of them I would be very unhappy.
