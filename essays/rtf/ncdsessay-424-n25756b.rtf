The type of life I lead is a very busy one. First of all I have my husband and daughter to look after. I have to do all the shopping by walking to the nearest town which is a mile away. Also apart from being a very busy life and mother I have a great many interests. First of all I ride an awful lot sometimes that takes me to [xxxxxxx], and once it took me right up to the North of Scotland. Also I swim a lot. I have won several cups in swimming one was for diving competition. My last interest is going for long rambles but I can't do these very often since I am tyed up with my job and work at home. I do however go for long walks on the weekend I take my daughter with me on these and my husband sometimes we take a picnic tea with us. I have a job as you may have gathered. I work as a bar maid in a pub in the town. I like doing that because I get quite a few free drinks from some nice men who bay some beers Also my boss lets me take some wine home when he is a very good mood. I often invite him round for dinner.  Words: 220
