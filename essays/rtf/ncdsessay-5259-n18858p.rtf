I am a music teacher in a secondy school. I have just taught the grils to play the 1812 overture. Tonight is the concert in which we play ths. When I got home I had a wash, had my tea and cleared up by 7 o'clock. The concert begins at 7 45. luckily I do not live to far from the school so I will leave at 25 minuets to 7. When I got there I was tuning up all the girls when suddenly the curtain went up and I went all red, Luckily it was a false alarm and the curtain went down again. When all the instruments were in tune I gave the signal and the curtains went up.
      In the tune I play the clarinet with anther girl who needed some help.
      During the concert on of the mothers brought her baby and most of the time it was crying and it made our music funny. One of the girls who sang a solo had a very nice voise but tonight she was flat. When I got home I had a nice cool shower and then got my supper ready. eat it then went to bed
      Next day when I got to school the staff congratulated me on teaching, what they thought some of the most dimest people. This day was the last day of term and so the girls had half day. When everyone had left the building the teachers had a little party and then we went home. That afternoon I had a dancing lesson. 1 hour tap dancing, 1 hour ballet dancing and half an hour of acro. When I got home it was 10.30 because my dancing teacher took me out to dinner. My days are very full.  Words: 295
