I am now 25 years old I am not married, I live in a flat on the edge of London. In my spare time I play for an Amateur football team and for my work I am a car engenier. My dream has always been to be a football manegar. In the mornings I get up very early and take my dog (name) for a walk I have a small breakfast and go to work, I come home in the evening and have a snak I the go to my desk and write a bit of my book which I hope to puplish when it is finished. The book is about this man who finds a foam and it spreads all over the world and in the end he is the only person left in the world and he gets rid of the foam and everybody gets back alive. I play football only on saterday and so I collect stamps as well,  Words: 162
