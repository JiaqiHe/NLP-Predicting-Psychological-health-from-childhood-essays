When I am 25 years old I am going to get a car and get lessons on driving . And when I have learned that I am going to get a job and earn some money . And When I am 28 years old I am going to Canada and work on a farm and help at harvest when the wheat is ready and when the harvest is done I will help to grow the next harvest . I will go traveling round Canada seeing things like the great motor's you see in the magazines . Then I will go  back to the farm and help with harvest. 
Once I am 30 years old I will go back to Scotland and see my father and mother and Aunt's and Uncle's and tell them how I got on .  Words: 138
