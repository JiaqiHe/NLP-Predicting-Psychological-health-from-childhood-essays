The year is 1983 and I am twenty five years old. I just left University and I am being trained at the London B.o.a.c. training centre to become a fully qualified Concord pilot. The first part of the corse is to learn how to control the airoplane this is a hard task because there are so many switches to remember. My mother and father are looking forward when I am qualified pilot because they will get half price tickets on the airoplane. Our house is a like a small block of flats which we own all to our selves. When I get paid for my job I will start a collecting old vintage cars. When I get married I will sell some of the vintage cars and make a progit on them so the money I get will go and help to by a house of my own. If I have anough money I will buy a few other houses and rent them for poorer people who cant aford to buy their own houses.  Words: 174
