My name is [name] I am twenty five years old, I am married my husbands name is [name] he is twenty seven. My Husband is a electrician and I am a housewife, but I do hairdressing in my spare time the extra money comes in handy. We have two children a boy of four and a girl of two years old. My husband sometimes goes away doing jobs, when he goes away we miss him very much. My mother sometimes stops while John is away. In our house there are three bedrooms and a bathroom upstairs, a lounge dinning room and a kitchen downstairs. We have a garage atached to the house, we keep gardening tools, bicycles and other odds and ends in it, we have no car yet but we hope to have one soon. We are buying the house but it will be a long time before it is paid for. My husband and I go out twice a month and when we do my mother babysits for us while we go to shows or the cinima. My husband and I are very happy together and hope, our children grow up to be happy and be proud of us.  Words: 201
