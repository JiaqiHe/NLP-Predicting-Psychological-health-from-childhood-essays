When I woke up it was half past seven, quickly I got out of bed and put on my dressing-gown. I opened the curtains and the sun shone in. The doorbell rang I answered it, it was the milkman. I gave him his money and picked up the letters that had been posted that morning. I quietly closed the door and went to make my breakfast.
I fed the cat and sat down to cornflakes, toast and a cup of tea. When I had finished I had a wash and got dressed I brushed my teeth and combed my hair. The time was then 8.30.
I was a teacher at a nearby school, and took English, Art, PE, and writing the first lesson (ENGLISH) was at 9.45. I had to be at the shcool at 9 30. I went upstairs made the bed and tidied the bedroom then downstairs I tidied up the rooms down there. I washed-up and took the washing from the line.
At 9.15 I set out for the school I worked at I walked as it was not very far.
When I got I got there I went straight to the English Room and got ready for the first lesson. When it was over the children went for their play. After play I took art and then it was dinner after dinner I took PE and writing.
