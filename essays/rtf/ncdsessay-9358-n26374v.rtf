I am 25 years old now I work and enjoy it because I work with horses I have two children at the age of 3 and 4. As well a horse-riding I enjoy Needlework and sometimes do oil-paintings. My husband is now 26 and owns an elochment where we keep our horses. Soon I hope to open a riding school. Now I work as a groom for a farmer but I will not soon. We go somewhere abroad every year. This year we hope to go to Whales. When I was younger I was hoping to have foster children but when we came and lived on a farm they *welfare*) would not let us.  Words: 114
