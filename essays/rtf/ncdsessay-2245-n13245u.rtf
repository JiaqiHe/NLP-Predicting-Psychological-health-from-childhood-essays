I hope that when I am 25 I will have a small cruising boat of my own. I have just got a job as draughtsman to a quite well knowen navel arcetect. I have just come home from work and I am planing to sail down to the Meditrainean sea in my leave which comes in two weeks time. I have decided to sail throught the Bay of Biscay and not through the French canals as the engline  in my boat is not very good. 
Two weeks later as I hoisted the main sail I felt rather excited. Before me and my wife had allwase sailed the boat, and had never sailed non-stop for more than 24 hours. Now we have a third person on board, a friend who offered to come, and we will have to take watches and sleep on board a moving boat!
The boat I have was desinged and biult by the boat yard I work for, so I got her a cost price. She is a very smart 25ft cruiser racer with four berths and a quater berth. She is varnished all over and her sails balance very well.
Below decks there are lots of books, a camera and a sketch pad, for a like reading drawing and taking photos. There is also the normal navigashnal gear and a log and other things you need.  Words: 228
