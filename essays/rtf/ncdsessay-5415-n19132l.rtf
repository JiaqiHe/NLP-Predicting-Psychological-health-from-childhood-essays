----------------------
I am 25 years and I live in the country in a large farm house with ares of land. The farm is large with many animals and crops as well as horses and dogs. 
     We have four bedrooms one play room and bathroom up stairs and a study, dining room, lounge, kitchen and hall down stairs. Their are very few houses near us and it is very quite. I have two children one aged one and the other 6 months old and hope to have more. I sew and cook alot and make clothes for my children and myself. My husband works on the farm all day long but sometimes we go riding to-gether. In the house we have two dogs both are small dogs. 
     Every year we go on holiday in other countrys. When the children are old enough I will work while they go to school. I think that I would look to teach sewing and cooking or be a vet, because I like animals very much and enjoy looking after them. I hope that we will all be a happy family. 
     Before I get married when I am much younger than 25 I would like to travel round the world and visit other people in other countrys.  Words: 213
