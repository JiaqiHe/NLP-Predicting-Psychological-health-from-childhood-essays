I am now twenty five my birthday is today and it is (date). I would like to be a nurse at (place) and help people to get better. I went to a university to learn French, Latin and Spanish and it was quite hard. Then after some time I went to do some nursing at (place) and it was a pleasant change from working at the university. I worked in the causulty department and it was realy quite busy. I worked in the day-time from nine-o'clock to ten p.m. and I was realy quite tired after that. After some time I went to work in the children's ward and I worked during the night. Every two hours we had to feed the babies and it was very interesting. I worked now from o **ne p.m. to 8.30 a.m and you could allways go to your room for tea. I enjoyed myselve allways at week-ends and I could allways get a rest. One night we had in the hospital a man who had been in a crash and had his right foot cut off by the bumper of a car and his foot was lying beside him. One night I was checking the wards and I saw a baby crawling on the floor the baby had fallen out of it's cot and couldn't get in again. After one month I wrote to see if I could get a job as a full time nurse at (place) and they said that they would try and find a place for me at last I was given word that they had found a place in (place) and I was to start work on the  Words: 280
