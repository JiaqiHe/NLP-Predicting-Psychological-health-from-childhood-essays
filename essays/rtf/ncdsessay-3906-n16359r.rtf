I now live in Israel where I teach history. I am married to the owner of a big firm. and I have 2 girls and a boy, the girls are 7, and 2 and the boy is 4 1/2. I get up at six a.m every morning, and wake the family then I make their breakfast and do as much housework as possible, 
      My Husband goes to work at 7 am. and I leave for school at 7.30, taking my elder girl to a nearby junior school. at 7.45, the Housekeeper comes and she looks after the children and does the rest of the housework.
      I teach at a school that starts work at eight a.m. and goes on till ten. thirty when there is fifteen minutes break then the work from 10.45 till one, when everyone goes home till 4.30 as it is almost impossible to work in the hea*t of the day. Then at 4.30 till 6.30, there are evening classes during One and halfpast I do any shopping that is needed and go home and take over from the Housekeeper. while she has a break.
      At 7.p.m. after a long day at work my husband returns home, very tired. and at about 9.30 we go to bed and next morning we start again.  Words: 217
