I am twenty five I work in a Elecricity office you do all sorts of fings like going round to the house's and empty the meter write out Electric bills and sumonsds. In my spear time i had to play for frampton* this is a football team. I like being a lectrishin becaue its got a lot of intresting fings in it. I play for Bristol city as well as frampton football club I have about two thousand pounds. A Electricity man is a very important job I am going to be a first divised footballer in the week times. When iam home I read book and then play card with my wife I go out and Monday's Wednesday's and Fridays to wrestling at yaete* I like being a footballer because you go to train* in park's and in your own ground you get a lot of fun out of football, expechely if your team win's. Id rather have football to Electricity My home life is very good iam very intrested* in rugby but it is a little bite to rough for me to play.  Words: 185
