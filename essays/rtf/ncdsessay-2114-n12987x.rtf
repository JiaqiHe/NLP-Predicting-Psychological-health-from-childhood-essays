At the age of 25 I would like to be a rugby player or a football player. I would not like to work in a factory because it would usualy be very noisy and could be very dangerous and could cause a nasty accident. I would like to be a rugby player bucause I know there is a lot of running and exersice in the game of rugby, I would like to be number 11 and I think it is the best possition of the side. I would also like to be a footballer* and play right wing or left wing because I like playing as a winger. 
      I would like to own a big house for me and my parents because I don't want to get married I want to be a bachalor any way. I would like also to own a big estate car and a shop like George Best.  Words: 153
