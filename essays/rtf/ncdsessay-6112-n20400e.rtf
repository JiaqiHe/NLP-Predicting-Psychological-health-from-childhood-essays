I am working in a home for mentle children. I have been here sise I was 18. I like the job I am doing and would only chane it for one thing and that is a air hostess. I wanted to be an air hostess ever since I started the Grammer school but somehow I failed my test, my best friend passed with flying coulers. I help the children get dressed in the mornings and undreessed at night,time. I feed them in the daytime and evry Sunday afternoon I take them to the park or the zoo. My wage is 22 pounds a month. I won't groumble because I like my job very much. I have a nice husband and 1 child. I only get to see them once evry month but they dont mind and I dont reley. Some times when I get home I find that my husband and my daughter [name] have set their mind on going on a weekend trip to the coast. I see them for four days in a month and some times for a whole week. I am reley quite lucky to have such a lot of time off. My home life is reley going well exerpet for the odd little arqments now and then. My little girl is just starting school she is a little bit frightend but I have ashourd her it will be allright she is going to the same school as I did so I am sure she will be in safe hands.
