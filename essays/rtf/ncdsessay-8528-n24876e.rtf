I am 25 years old I am sitting in a desk with 2 other people around me. I am leading a satesfty life up to yet. This is a hard working dump I am in now I hope to get a nice and clean job when I am at the age of 27 years old. I'll be glad when they knock this old dump. when i get the proper wages I will look for a wife and we will by a flat first of all then we by a lucksress hotel and run it clean their will be no stench at all and thats not all we will have rossets of different football teams pinned up on the wall. We will have a menu which says hot dogs one shilling each and we will even afford to put rooms upstairs. Sorry I have to go now the bells just gone.  Words: 150
