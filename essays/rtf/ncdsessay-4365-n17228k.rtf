I am engaged to a girl called [female name]. My job is working with butterflies and moths in the Worldwide Butterflies offices and I am earning xxxx25 in two months. My interests are still animals, Insects and biology, but I have also taken art up as my dad is an artist. I am leading a happy life as all the things I have dreamed about are coming true. I am at the stage of wearing rather mad clothes I have a nice small car and I am hoping to have a nice house in the country. I am still living with my mum and dad in a semi-detatched house. My family is by no means rich but we have saved up our money and have got a nice television and three-piece-sweat and our furniture is nearly all teaque wood. I go out quite a bit at night with [female name] to dances and night school. I have many friends and one of them is an old school-mate called [male name] [surname].  Words: 171
