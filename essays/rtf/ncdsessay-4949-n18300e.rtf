I have a job as a mechanic for racing cars. I have had this job for about two years now. This job is quite exciting because it seems to take you to foreign countries. I have taken up the sport of shooting which is enjoyable The place where I shoot is on the ****. When I get married I am hoping to get a small farm there. At the moment I am leading a good life. I am still living at home. Another thing I like doing is driving racing cars. As I am a racing car mechanic I dont realy have much difficulty in obtaining a car. I have taken a keen interest in football and go to see many matches. As I have said before I am still living at home but in a few months I am hoping to be married. Recently I joined a glider club but I only go there ocasionaly. My brother is allready married so we now have one less in the family. Life at home is ok but somtimes it can get boring. As I have a degree I should not find it to hard to find another if I give the job I allready have up. I am putting most of the money I earn into a bank so when I am married I can buy all the things that may be needed. All the things have changed so there are lots of new experiances to be tackled.
