I am 25 years and I have just been married. After I had come back from my honeymoon we went to our new house. It had just been built on a new estate. I work as an assistant in a frabric shop were they sell fabric to make dresses. My job is only a part time job as I have 2 children and I have to do the housework as well. I have a lot of interests. Especially on is which keeping plants. Some of my other interests are collecting old British stamps, art and reading books. On Sundays I get a chance to relax as I am busy all the week with the children. When it comes to Sunday night my children are very lazy*, and I have to get all their clothes ready for school the next morning. The age of my children are 5 and 11. I also have 2 pets which are cats. We had one cat and it grew up and had a baby and now that baby has grown up and is a cat now.  Words: 181
