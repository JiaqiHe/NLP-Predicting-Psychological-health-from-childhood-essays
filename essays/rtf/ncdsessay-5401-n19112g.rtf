----------------------
I am an Architect. I have an E type Jaguar and I have a very good home life. I have a wife and a child. My child is a boy of one year old and my wife is twenty four. I live in my Bungaloe that I designed my self. I like to go to the baths at least twice a week. I take my wife and child with me. They just spectacte because my son is to small to swim. When he is about four I will get him private swimming lesons because when I was young I got them and I found that they were very helpful. I like my job very much because I have always loved to design houses even when I was young. I have a Daimler V8 250, as wellas my E. type Jaguar. Nearly every Sunday if it is good weather I take my mother and father a run in my car. I take my wife round to my mother-in-laws some nights too. I take my wife out to dances and leave my son with my mother or mother in Law. 
I am going to Bornmouth my holidays this year. I will take the Daimler to Bornmouth because it is the bigger of my two cars and I will be able to get more lugage in the boot. My mother and father have a car it is a cortina. My father is a good driver buthe dose not drive as fast as I do. When my father was my age he loved driving fast too. My dad is 59 and mother is 56. I dont want to be cramated when I die.  Words: 279
