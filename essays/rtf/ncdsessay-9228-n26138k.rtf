The chairs were plasice like an air cushoin, the trains were all fitted with air ventorlaters, lights, electric fires, radios and televisions (colaor).All bus,cars, and lorryies were powered by electric.Which I had to go on a bus, the buses were fetted with lights etc, like a monotrain.My job is an engineer for the (place) that make T.mates. They a box which anyone can go in and it takes you to where you want to go on Earth, Venus, and Mars, We also make machines for space travel and walking an the moon.Which has not been conqeured yet.
