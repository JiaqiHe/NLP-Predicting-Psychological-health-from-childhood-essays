Now that I am 25 I will do what I please. For my work, I am a shopkeeper in my dads shop. I will have one dog for a pet and one rabbit. I will go to the pictures atleast one night in the week. My work is all about selling food and sweets. I would like to go France for hoilday and if I liked it there I would live there. I would get married at the age of 21 and I would like one child. I would live in a 3 bedroom ghouse If I did not like France I would live here in [village]. I would stop work to look after my housecleaning. Later on when I had finished work I would go up stairs to make the beds. Then I would go out to the shop with the dog. I would get out the tea and turn on tellevison and stay they while I had my tea. Then I had to get up to wash the dishes. Then if the football was on I would watch that just for a bit of fun Then it was time for my daughter to bed. Then it was time for me to go.  Words: 204
