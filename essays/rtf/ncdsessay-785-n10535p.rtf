I AM 25 AND I AM A TECHNTITION AND WORK WITH COMPUTERS AND ROCKETS AND I TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. I GET TO MY WORK BY TRAIN AND BUS. I LIVE IN LONDON AND MAKE MODELS OF SHIPS. I GO TO THE BOWLING CLUB AND PLAY WITH THE ONE ARMED BANDIT. THE HOUSE IS ON THE STREET NEXT TO THE SHOPS AND IT HAS A GARDEN. ONE OF COUNTRIES I GO TO IS AMERICA DOING THINGS WITH COMPUTERS. THE BOWLING CLUB IS NOT FAR AWAY AND I HAVE ONE THE JACKPOT ONCE. THE BACK GARDEN IS BIGGER THAN THE FRONT. THE HOUSE ISN'T VERY BIG BUT BIG ENOUGH.
