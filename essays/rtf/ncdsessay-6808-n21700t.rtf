I would go and work in a shop, most proberly be married and got a baby. If it was a boy I would call it [name] and a girl [name]. At first i would live in a flat. (if my husband would a lower it). in [city]. But best of all I would like to live in the country. Have a pony and go riding all afternoon. Have a dog Sometime's its a drag but we would mange. play with my child and that the same time keep the house tidey. Have a car, and pianio to play when the children get older. Make it look very nice and put with a bit of luck flower's every were. I would make sure he never got drank. If I was not married I would stay at home. And when I was not that work help Mum with the housework. If I had a baby and had now father. I would let Mum have it till I was married, I think that would be best. I would all-ways make sure there was a baby sitter, befor going out, wait to see if he (or She) came. If they sent a letter or phoning up, to say they can't come. I would not got out at all that night. It would be disoppointing for me, but that's how it would be.  Words: 228
