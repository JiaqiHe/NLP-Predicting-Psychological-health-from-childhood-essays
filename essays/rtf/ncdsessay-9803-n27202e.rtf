I am 25 years old and I live in Newcastle. I am married and I have three childrens, all boys. I am a technition and I work at Newcastle University. I like it at the University as I get payed very well. I go to a club every Friday and during my spare time I play for there football team as an amatuer. At home I usually collect stamps as well as going for a run in the car with the children if it nice. On holidays I have a license to go to The Farne Islands to put rings on birds legs, many Arctic Terns. Altogether I have got 8 weeks holiday a year to be taken whenever I like. During 4 weeks I go to the Farne Islands. My home is a Private house in [suburb] it is very big. During Sundays  I like to go to the Airport as I am very interested, I take the children as well. When I started at the university I got a job that I could not do, so I had too take more training until I * came very good, and I could do most anything. Every night when I can not think of anything to do I read a book or I go to bed soon. I am very careful at work not too electricute myself. I go home for my dinner each dinner time because I dont like any other food. I am very keen on gardening and I plant seeds every year. In my back garden I have all vegetables but in the front garden I plant lovely flowers. Every year I enter in the Flower Show, this year I won a Shield for having the best Daliahs.  Words: 291
