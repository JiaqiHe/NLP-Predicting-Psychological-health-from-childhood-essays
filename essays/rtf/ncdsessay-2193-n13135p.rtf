My home is a cottage in North Wales I have to drive quite a long way to my work but this I do not mind because I quite like driving. My cottage is quite drab from the out side but the inside is not quite so bad I have a slate fire place (welsh slate) and above that I have my climbing rope which is very procariously balanced on a nail (this rope I do not use for climbing) the back ground of that is mustard coulord lin**h my chairs are black and my curtains are a type of blue tie-die with mustard in them which I picked for above the fire place then I have wood floors and the mantle piece is also wood. I have several intrests. I like canoeing although I do not do as much canoing as I do climbing for my summer holidays I some times go to the alps or norway and there I do a lot of snow and ice work  Words: 240
