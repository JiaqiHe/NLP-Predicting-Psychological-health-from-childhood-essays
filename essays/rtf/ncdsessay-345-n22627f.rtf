I am 25 years of age, I live in a big house it has five bedrooms, dining room, lounge, and kitchenet. I have a wife and two children, a big jagur car which is just big enough to hold the family. The children are two boys, very energetic, they love swimming and rugby. My wife is a type that can mix with anybody, she is a good bridge, and very pasent, she is a good nurse when the children hurt themselves. The names of the family are Brian, Kevin, the twins, Edith my wife and me, Bobby. The doors of the house are orange and round the windows of the door white, the window frames are painted cream. We have oil fired central heating and an electric cooker, and strip lighting in the kitchenet. My wife does not work because I bring plenty money home from were I work, I work at the catterpiller factory at [xxxxxxx] I work as a pot spot welder, because I do the work of putting the holds through the bits of steel that make the catterpiller tracks. Each piece of steel weighs 1 ton each. I get payed £31 a week and the firm payes my petrol bill.  Words: 204
