When I . am twenty five years old I hope I am working as an engineer building bridges . I would like to have a house and my friend to stay in it with me . I would not like to get married because when you come home on a fridy your wife is wantng money for a new dress and a new pair of shoes . Then if your our shoping every window you go by she asks for something out of it so I dont want to get married. I would like to have a dog, a black one I would not like it to be a small dog . And when I come home from work, when i open the door it would jump up on me . I would like to go on a cruse all round the world . I would like my freind to come with me and my dog .  Words: 157
