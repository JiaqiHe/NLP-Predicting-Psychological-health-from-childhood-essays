Every saturday I go riding with a friend of mine called Mary. I some times go to play hockey or tennis but not* very often.

He has got dark hair and brown eyes and is very sweet. My hobby is breeding rabbits. I have one New Zealand white doe, a flemish giant back and doe and a baby wild rabbit. One morning when I came in (for) - to the shop I was working in I saw every body crowding round the boss. Then the boss pushed his was (inb)* out of the crowd and came over to me. The he said ""you've been working for me for along time and I'm giving you and your family a holiday in sunny spain for two weeks."" I was more then over joyed to hear of the good news. and with permission from noy* boss I ran home and told my mother. We all started to pack our things and soon we were on our way to spain. The weeks past quickly and we were soon home, and when we got home I was no longer an assitant. but a quallified shoe girl."  Words: 267
