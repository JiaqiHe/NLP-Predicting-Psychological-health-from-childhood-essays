It is four years since I recieved the key of the door and now I have left university and am working hard for a living. My job as a computor engineer is hard . The wages are low and I have a family to support . My interests are much the same as they were fourteen years ago. Photography is my main hobby , I have taken some beautiful pictures with my camera and sold them for up to ten pound . My first-born, (name) is now four years old and is developing into a strong lad . My wife teaches at a kidergarten and takes (name) with her every day , but how I wish I was eleven years old again . Able to be free and not worry about keeping a family.  Words: 134
