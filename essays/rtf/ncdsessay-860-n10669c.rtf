Three months ago it was my twenty fifth birthday I am not leading a noisy life but it is not too quiet. I run a small riding stable in (place) at which I earn about xxxx14a week, but this is full time, because I have a port time job somewhere else. My favourites hobbies are painting and riding though I like gardening too. I still live with my mother and father and do most of the keeping of the house. My riding stables gets quite a lot of custom. I get approxamately two hundred and fifty pupils a week. Though I only have fourteen horses at the moment I hope to have a few more by the end of the year which will take my total up to about twenty two as I have four liveries apart from my own fourteen.
