I am 25 years old, I am living with my mother and father in Scotland. ****. My work is in England, I am a short hand typist, sometimes I do short hand. At home I sometimes help mum do dinner do the shopping and tidy up, then in the night go to clubs and dances with my boyfriend.
The life I am leading is very difficult to explain, but I do the house work, go out and now I have to goto England for my job. when I got there I go to a big building, there ** 20 flats, and you can ge*uss where mine would be, on the very top. I go in, the lift's broken so I have to climb the stairs, about 20 flights of stairs, the time you get up there your too tired to get on with any short hand. The door is grey and the door handle is very big, when I get in, the boss gives me the 10 letters I sit down and he starts. Then I give him the short hand and he say's get it wrote out neater and post it. 
When I get back home my mum gives me a rest and I then go back out with my boyfriend.  Words: 211
