When I am about 25 years old I will work at a office in Bolton. At home my husband and I are interested in going for holidays and other things. I have a little gir age four and a little boy ged two. In these years I have not been able to work. The children play nearly all day, my hobbie is knitting and baking. This year I will be able to go back to work and start my job up again. I like my work very much indeed and husband likes his work, I am very interest in knitting and needle work. On Saturdays we do shopping and go out for the day, at Saturday nights we have partys or go out. My work is short hand and tiping in the house I do cleaning up and cook, I cook at least three meals a day. I am interested in lot of things sometimes we go to the park and play tennis, tennis is my husbands favorot game. My favorot game is net ball, the children play with a pram and balls, the little boy [male name] will go to school this year and the little girl [female name] will stay with my mother. Some times I will take my mother out in the car for a ride. I am very interested in plants and vegertable, my husband is not very well up on gardening and hate it.
