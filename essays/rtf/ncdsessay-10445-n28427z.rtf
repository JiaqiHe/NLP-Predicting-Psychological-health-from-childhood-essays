ON THE [DATE OF BIRTHDAY] IT IS MY 2,5TH BIRTHDAY. I AM GOING TO LOOK BACK ON THE LIFE I HAVE LED THESE LAST 2,5 years. I WAS BORN AT THE DATE OF [DATE OF BIRTH]. I GREW TO A NORMAL SIZED BABY. MY BABYHOOD SOON PAST AND I MADE FRIENDS I THINK I STILL REMEBER THEY NAME'S, THEY WAS [NAME], [NAME] AND [NAME]. AT THE AGE OF FIVE I STARTED SCHOOL. I WENT WITH [NAME] AND [NAME] TO [NAME OF SCHOOL] INFANT SCHOOL I NEVER WENT WITH [NAME] FOR HE IS A CATHOLIC AND HE WENT TO [NAME OF SCHOOL], INFANT SCHOOL. WHEN I WAS SIX A NEW SCHOOL OPENED IT WAS CALLED [NAME OF SCHOOL]. THEN [NAME] AND [NAME] LEFT [NAME OF SCHOOL] AND WENT TO [NAME OF SCHOOL] INFANT SCHOOL. I STAYED AT [NAME OF SCHOOL] FOR I HAD LOTS OF FRIENDS THERE. THEN I KNEW I LIKED DRAWING AND SO I PRACTICED, AND IN THE LAST YEAR OF THAT SCHOOL I GOT A PRIZE FOR DRAWING OFF MRS [NAME] IT WAS A LADYBIRD BOOK ON SHIP'S. I GOT A SHOCK OFF THE TEACHER WHEN SHE SAID I WAS GOING TO [NAME OF SCHOOL] INSTEAD OF [NAME OF SCHOOL] JUNIOR SCHOOL. WHEN I GOT TO THE SCHOOL I WAS WITH [NAME] AND [NAME] AGAIN. OUR TEACHER WAS CALLED MISS [NAME] AND AT THE END OF THAT YEAR I GOT THE ART PRIZE. EVERYBODY STARTED CRYING FOR OUR TEACHER WAS LEAVING. SHE WAS GOING TO BE MRS [NAME] AFTER THE SUMMER HOLIDAYS. WHEN WE WENT BACK TO SCHOOL WE GOT A TEACHER CALLED MR [NAME]. AT THE END OF THAT YEAR MR [NAME] MARRIED ONE OF OUR OTHER TEACHER'S MISS [NAME], AND I GOT THE ART PRIZE FOR THE SECOND TIME.
