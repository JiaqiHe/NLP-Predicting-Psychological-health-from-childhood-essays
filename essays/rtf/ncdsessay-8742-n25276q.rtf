----------------------
I lead a good life with my wife. I work in a sweet shop and I get very well paid. I know a lot of people who I see nearly every day in the shop. My favouriet intersts are gardening and mending old clocks. I live in a house called [house] which consists of two bedrooms, one kitchen, a dinning-room and a front room, the garden is quite big with a big oak tree at the back. We have a little dog called 'Pongo'. Every thing has turned modern, since I was a child, we have a colour T.V. which is controled by a little hand control. The cars have turned very modern and can go up to very high speeds. The sliding windows are controled by a little switch in the dashboard. Some people are even living on the moon with robot dogs for company. Some hovertrains are being used in the lake district. More and more Hovercrafts are being used around the coast, now that it is 1 o'clock I have to go back to work so now I must leave you.  Words: 184
