I am 25 years of age and I go to college, I would like to be a aircraft pilot and I am training very hard for the job and I hope I get it. My home live is fairly pieceful I like gardining, and at the moment I am paiting the house. I live in a small village Just out side [xxxxxxx] and it is very nice. my intrests are football, garding, and cricket. I am married and I dont have any children. College is smashing, every year we have a boat race Just like Oxford and Cambridge, We also have races, high jump, long jump, pole vault, and horse racing. We make our own boats for the race and the nearer we get to the day of the race the more exciting it gets, We have had 10 races, and we have one 7 and lost 3. They all call me green fingers because I do a lot of garderning.  Words: 161
