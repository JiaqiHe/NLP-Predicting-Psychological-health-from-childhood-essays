When I am 25 years old I hope to be in the Royal Air Force. I will not get married because women want evry thing the eyes see so I will not have to waist money on them. If I don't get o'leavls to fly Aeroplanes I would like to be a engineer in the Air force. When I am on leave I will have a Job helping the MIlkman or go to the pub. or I might play football for a team I will be alble to stay and places for the night. I could move on to diffrent pleaces to stay. But if I didnt go in to the Air force I would join the Army. I could go on Holiday when I was on leave. But I might stay at the same place as were I am staying and I could get some wear to sleep there and would not have to go anywere or find my way home. Hit wouldn't cost any thing on the bys because I would not have to go any were on it. I mite get a lift by a freind who is staying with me and he mite have a car, or I could have a lift by hitch hiking. In the Air force I hope to travl around the world stoping at diffrent countries.
