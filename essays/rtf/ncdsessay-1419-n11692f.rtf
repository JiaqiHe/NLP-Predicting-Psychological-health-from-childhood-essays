"At the moment I am living in Leeds, and attending the Science courses at the Univercity. I have rent a small flat in the city centre, in my spare time I am studying astronomy and archeology, last week I passed my ""O"" level in science and maths.
When I leave the univercity I am* hoping to become a scienctist or a meathmatician. In a few days I am going to marry. When we chose the house I am going to choose one on* the outskirts of the city.
Then we are going to move to the north."  Words: 95
