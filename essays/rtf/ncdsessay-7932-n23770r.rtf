I am 25 years old I work at a school I am an english teacher. I enjoy my work very much and find it very interesting. The school is for girls only. There are 26 girls in my class. [female name] [surname] is the oldest in my class and [female name] [surname] is the youngest tomorrow all the school is going to look round Liverpool cathedral. Some of the girls are going to make sketches of parts of the cathedral. There will be a prize for the best sketche. My hobby is swimming and when the puplic bathes are open I go with my friend [female name]. I live with my mother and father we have quite a big house in its own grounds. I help my father with the gardening and my mother I help with the house. I like looking for wild flowers if we go into the country I have a good wild flower book. At the weekends me and my cousin go to the tennis courts sometimes and I enjoy every bit of it.  Words: 178
