I might get married and settle down in a house I think I might take up a hobby like moddeling or flying or sailing ** model boats and model aeroplanes. I will try and get a good, well paid job and start saving up some money so that my family and I will be able to go for some good holidays sometimes. I might try and build up a stock of good books and encyclopedias. I might get a car as it would probably come in useful for getting around. I would try t** get around a bit and get to know people. If I earn enough I might get some new things like central heating, a refrigerator a garage and a workshop if the house has not already got them and lots of things like that.  Words: 137
