When I am 25 I would like to be a vet and look after animals which are hurt and not wanted. I would like my own study with all my medicenes for the animals. I would like my own zoo with hundreds and hundreds of animals in.I would study diseases from which the animals die and invent my own medicine to cure them I would teach them to obay me and teach them hundreds of tricks so they would now me and do any think I asked them. When they are well again I will let them go back to there familys and play and be happy. onece more, I will not just have one sort of animal I will have hundreds of all diverent kinds and even birds. They will all no me well and they wont bite. I will go to houses and help animal pets and learn and study in books untill there is nothing else to no about them. my mony for the animals food will come by going to houses to help the animals not to die. I will get maried and I will have a baby and teach him or her to be like me and no every before I die. And show them how to make medicines and how to operate on si*k animals.
