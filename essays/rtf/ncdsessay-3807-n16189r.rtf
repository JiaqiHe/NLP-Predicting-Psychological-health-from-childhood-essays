My work is dress making and designing. In the morning I get up at 8 o'clock and leve my house at 9. I drive to work and get there abou half past 9. Then I go to the are room where I start to think out a new design. After about 2 hours I have usually got some adea of what my design will be like. Sometimes it takes me more than a week to think of one. After my design is finished I pick a merterial that will go with it. About that time a go for a cup of coffee and something to eat. Then after that I go to the room where I cut my design out. My frined helps me I do this. The next job I do is to sew my design together when this job is done I get my frined who is a modle to try it on. them my design goes to a fahsion contest where if I am sucssful it gets sold.
