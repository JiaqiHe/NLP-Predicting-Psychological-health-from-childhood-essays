I am 25 years old , I have a little girl and a little boy who are twins. My mother looks after the children when my husband and I are out at work. My husband is an engineer and I am an air hostess . I work down on the ground in the office at the airport . I am home in the house round about 7. o'clock , and my husband is home at 5' o'clock. Thursday is my half day so I take the children down town to get them new clothes, and get myself new clothes , and get my messages . On Monday i am home at five and my mother goes out to the bingo. My husband and I go out for lunch and go to the theatre on a Saturday . On a Sunday we go for a run in the car with the children. My mother-in-law has a caravan down by the coast . and we often go down for the weekend. In the summer I have three weeks holiday . I have an aunt who stays down in (place) so I go down and stay with her for the holidays . I am very glad that I stayed on at school until I was eighteen because I have a very good job and I hope that I don't have to change it.  Words: 230
