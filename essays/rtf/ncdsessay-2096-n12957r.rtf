When I am 25 I will be an air hostess. I would travel around the world in a big VCIO. I would serve a lot of new dishes. I VCID would go to Canada, America and France. It would go all over the would. When I start my new jod I would be very excited about it. I would find a lot of new friends being an air hostess. A lot of my new friends would be pilots and air hostesses. I would work for bea. The aeroplane would always be nice and clean and the dishes would always be attractive. Everytime the passengers would always be comfortable. If my uniform got a very little stain I would wash it. In the little kitchen I would always work hard in it. I would have a little curtain over the door-way. It would be the same colour as the seats. When I would be on leave I would buy a little dog. When I got back to work I would ask one of my friends who would be a nice to my dog. They would have a little girl for my dog to play with. It would be a nice little girl.  Words: 201
