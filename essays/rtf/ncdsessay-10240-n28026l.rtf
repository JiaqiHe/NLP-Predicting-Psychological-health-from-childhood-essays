I think I am going to do a job as a hairdresser in a shop. I am going to do mummy's hair, she likes it in a comb in the middle of her head.
I still like my swimming and I go once a week. I like to go to the cinema with my mummy, my daddy and my (name) but not (name) the dog.
At the weekend we have the ride to a picnic and have a lovely time. Daddy likes cricket and he does not play so much now. At home I have a friend called (name) she takes me out for a walk and at Christimas we went singing carols.
