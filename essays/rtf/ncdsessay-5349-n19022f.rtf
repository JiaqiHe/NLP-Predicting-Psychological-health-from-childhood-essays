I have just left collage and I am 25 and am going to become an Air Hostest and I have been study-ing langueges I can speak dozens. I have just started doing it and I think It is a very initresting job It is not a boring job at all and you get quite a few holidays When I am on these holidays I have quite a few hobies I take children horse riding and I go swiming and dancing and I am a bellring-er I am just got married and he also went to collage and he is a piolet and is 27 years old we both have dangerous jobs but are very nice we are hoping to have children soon but not till about a year which then I will be finish my exam. What I like about being a air hostest is that you get around a meet very intresting people. My husband and I get on very well together and never argue. When we are on leave we do a lot of swiming together which we both like very much As I mensioned before we like dancing and go most saturdays We both like* animals but we cant have one because theres no one to look after it. Our leave is for about two weeks and then we go back to work.  Words: 226
