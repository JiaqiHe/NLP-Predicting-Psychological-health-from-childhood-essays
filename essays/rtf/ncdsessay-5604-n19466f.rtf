It was Friday 4th December last day of school and then I would start my carrer 
I thought very hard and at last I decided to be an air-hostess it was very hard to make my mind up between being an air hostes and being a hair dresser.
We had to do a lot to be an air hostes and one of the hardesed things was learning to do a pareshot but at last I did it and I was aloud to go on the plane but there one last think to do and that was to learn all diffrent languages I had to learn French, German, Polish and Czechoslovakian. 
After I had learned all the languages that I had to learned I was to go on my first trip to Franse. I went on Monday Septemder 8th. It was nice knowing a lot of people and* one of the most exciting part of going on a* trip is when we get of the plane and have* two weeks off to do any think we like*
The two weeks went very quikely and *** soon we were back on the plane and ready to go to Czechoslovakia.
It was lovely at Czechoslovakia but we only had 1 week off instead of two and that went quiker than over **** when we got home Mum Dad and **** were all there waiting to ask what it was like.  Words: 234
