Now I am 25 years old and my job is a hair dresser I like it alot and soon it will be my shop because the head is leaving and I am bying it. I have four people working. for me. I have one child a boy who as just started school. We live in a bungalow here at [town]. Soon we are coming to live over the shop. I will find it alot easyer when we come to live over the shop becuase I will not have to bus it home. When I have some spare time I take my boy to the baths to lurn him to swim. I like to read books from the library at night. My boy [name] is only 4 and I was married at 20 years of age. My husband also likes to read. Some times I lose my temper but not very often. Also I like to look at old pictures of my weading and when I was a little girl. My home life as been good fun. When I was 11 I went to [town] with the school I will never forget that. We want to give are son a good life to. In a weeks time we are going to Scotland, one of the girls said she would take over the shop way I was a way. I liked TV alot when I was younger but I do not have much time to watch it now. I do not let my child lose much school he is even having his holiday in the summer holidays. I take after my mother a very lot my ways. I am the same with my boy as my mothe was with me. I enjoy my life and I do not think any think will change it. Every one in family enjoys there self. I hope we all stay that way.  Words: 316
