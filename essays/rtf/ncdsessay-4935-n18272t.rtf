I am 25 years of age and I have been married for four years. I have a little boy called Antony who is three years if age. I work as a part-time hairdresser for three days each week, Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. My mother looks after Antony while I am at work. I get xxxx5 a week. My husband is a Carpenter and he earns xxxx20 a week. He goes to work at half-past seven, and her returns home about half-past 5. By that time I have his dinner ready for him. I have a very nice home decorated with modern furnishings and fitted carpets. We have a coloured T.V. set and a radio. Antony has a room of his own decorated as a nursery where he plays when I am busy doing the house-work. Antony goes to bed at 6 o'clock at night and gets up in the morning at 9 o'clock. If I have soem spare time in the afternoon, I take Antony to the park where he plays on the swings. We go to the sea-side for our holidays every year.  Words: 184
