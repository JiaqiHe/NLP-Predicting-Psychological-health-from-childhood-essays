I am now 25 years of age. I work in a hairdressing salon. I leave home at 8.30 am. My shop opens at 9 o'clock. My home is in Cobber Road. I have no children, butr I am married, and we live in a bunglow. There are too bedroom's, a living and a kitchen. We have a parrot and a puppy. We have a very big garden. In the garden there is a swinging seat, and there are a lot of flowers' in our garden. We have not got a famaliy yet, but we hope to have one soon.
In the salon I have employd 15 girls, 5 of them are still traning. Every week we have about 90 heads to do, as well as about 20 to cut, but we manage all right. 
I lead a very happy life. When I get in from work, my husband has our dinner ready, last night we had liver, bacon, chips, pea's, and tomartoes.
I like being a hairdresser, becaures you get such good pay. We get xxxx15 10s 6 1/2 d every week.  Words: 180
