My life now as 25 is very intresting. I have Just finished university and I am a surgeon. My intrests are reading, woodwork, and during my holidays, hostelling. I am also a batchelor. I have a college degree as well as my G.C.E. At the hospital we have a check-up to make sure that we have not forgotten anything. At home, I repair chairs, and tables etc. My work leeds me into sights which are sometimes unbearable. When in the operating theatre, if your'e nervous, one twitch, and the peron is dead. At first I studied to be an anasthetist. That is the person who gives the anasthetic in the operating theatre. Many surgeons work in Harley street. I am going to be transferred to a small country hospital where the* casualtys are uasally treated for burns, accidents from farm machinery. I spent a course at this hospital. The hospital looks* grey and black, but when inside, it's also very modern. nearly better than a large hospital. My home is a small cottage, mostly with old furniture and paintings etc. I am very lucky to have bought this cottage because it was going to be used as a corn store. I have bought an M.G. car. These acrs cost about xxxx900. I live about 5 miles away from the hospital. I regularly pick up one of my colleagues in my car. I have also an old motorcycle which I inherited from my father.
