"      ""Today, I've been very busy, [name]. When I got to work this morning I had to start straight away by setting a colly's leg. The farmer said that he had broke his leg while rounding up a bunch of stray sheep. Then a young boy came in with a rabbit which had got canker. It had not got a good grip so I gave the boy some ointment to rub on his rabbit's ear every 12 hours. No one came for another halfhour so I sat down and played chess with my new assistant, [name]. He was just going to move his bishop when the bell rang an in came a man leading a cheatah. I said ""Whats wrong with this fellow"" The man, who told us he was Mr. [name] told us than his cheatah was playing with a rubber ball when he swallowed it. We had quite a struggle to get him on the operating table. It took  five minutes before we could start operating. By the time we had finished it was 3 p.m. I told Mr. [name] that he would have to get a much bigger ball. We had no more patients after that. Ah, thats the kettle boiling, I'll go and make a cup of tea."""  Words: 212
