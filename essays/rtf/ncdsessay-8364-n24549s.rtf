When I am twenty five I don't expect Ill by married. I would like to live somewhere in the country with a bungalow in about an acre of land Also I would regulaly to go to an old people's club and give pleasure with my chills* of piano banjo and mouth organ. For my job I should like to be an organist for at the moment I play the organ after church I will still sing in a choir because I like singing solo's. Also I shall try and be either an electronic engineer an teacher of a chef.  Words: 99
