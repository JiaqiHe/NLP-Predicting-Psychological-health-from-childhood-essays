I am now 25 years old and my work is a hairdresser. My home life is very pleasent. I like my work and find it very interesting. We have many customers diving the day and we work till eight o'clock at night. There are three of us doing the job, ***** **** and I. During my spare time at home I do the house work and sometimes I go shoping. Every morning I get out of bed at seven o'clock to be at work for half past eight. Every night when I get home from work I go and visit my mother and father. At the week end I often go shopping.  Words: 112
