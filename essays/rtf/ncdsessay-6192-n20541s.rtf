I am married and I have two children, a girl called [name] and a boy called [name]. My husband is called [name] and he is an engineer. We have got a little red mini, my husband drives the mini because i can't drive. We live in a little bungalow. [name] has just started school at the age of four and a half but [name] junior aged three just plays with his friend till [name] comes home. When they are old enough to go to school by themselves I may get a job somewhere. [name] does not want me to get a job but a little extra money will always come in handy, thats what I say. [name]s hobbies are reading and painting, he is quite a good painter and he has painted me a lovely country scene to hang up in the lounge. Sometimes I give [name] an old pinafore and her daddy gives her alittle painting stand with some paper on it and a paint pallet and brush and that keeps her quiet for half an hour. [name] junior likes playing with his boats in the bath.  Words: 188
