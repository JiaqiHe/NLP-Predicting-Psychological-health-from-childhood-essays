Every day I have to go to the shops to get food like food for Sunday dinner, some tined meet if we are going out in the car any where, fruit like apples, oranges, pears, and bananas. When I come from the shop I have to tidy up all the roomes and dust and put the hoover on. Then I put on the diner and watch it very carefully then my husbant comes home and I dish up the dinner, then when he has eaten his dinner we go in the one room and I ask him how did his work go and was anybody home ill. He says sometimes it went yery well and nobody was away. When he goes back to work I have a rest then I go to see how my next door neybore is getting on and I have a little talk with her. then I go back in the house and I put some make-up on and I go to meet my children from school and ask them how school got on. Then somtimes I go over to my mother and have a talk with her Then I come home and I cook the tea dish it up when my husband comes home. Then I sit down sometimes and watch the televetion with my husband and children.  Words: 223
