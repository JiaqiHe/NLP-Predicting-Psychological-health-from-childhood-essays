I would like to have twins because I would enjoy dressing them in the same types of clothes. I am studying art, domestic science and english literature. Whenever I have any spare time I go shopping and visit mummy. I usually take my homework back to mummy and then she can help me as well as us having a talk about what we are all doing.
