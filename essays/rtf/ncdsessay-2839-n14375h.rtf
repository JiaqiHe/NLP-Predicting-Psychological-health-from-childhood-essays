I am a Secutary and I go to work every morning exept on surtain day's. I live in a small house and I live on my own. My Interests are mostly the house-hold things cleaning, dusting, making the house look tidy, and of course my Job. I have to travel every morning to the office and travel home again in the evening. I don't Smoke . I try to go to church every Sunday. I go to town to get the shoppping and to go to work. I have a little cat who's name is Snowy and the next door neighbour look's after it for me when I go to work. My little house has not got a name and it has a little garden in the garden there are some flowers, I try to do gardening but I cant alway's because I haven't got the time I watch little television and when I have got the time I take a long walk into the Country. I like to look at the birds going by in the sky, and to look at the countrieside.  Words: 184
