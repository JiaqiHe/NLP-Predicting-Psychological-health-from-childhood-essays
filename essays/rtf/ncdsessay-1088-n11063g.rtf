When I am 25 years old I should hope to be an Air Hostess. I would like to live in a house of my own with two children. I would like to lead a good and honoust life. My Religion would be a Roman Catholic. I would like to go abrod to A merica or Canada to live there for a while, with my family. Eventully I would come back to my home town. I would like a rich husband with plenty of money. My best interest is raising a family of my own They would learn manners and to be obedient. I would like to get married before I was 25 years old. I think 21 years old would suit me.
After a while I would, sell my house and get an even lovelier one than before. IF I was an Air Hostess I would get plenty of money Mr children would never be afraid of an aeroplane infact I would teach them to love aeroplanes, People say its as easy as riding on a bird I don't think that is so, because although I've never rode a bird in my life Have you? I don't think so. Any way I would'nt try it, if I were you. Sometimes I ride big horses that is one of my hobbies although I don't do it often infact I hardly ever do it. Is' not 25 years old is such a long way off I don't it will ever come Just now I am thinking of the future I suppose every body has a beginning and an ending.  Words: 266
