My name is David Wood I come from [town] in cornwall. Today I am having my first test flight in a phatom Jet I have been studding about it for five years. I felt nevious as I climbed into the copit, comandor [male name] [surname] climbed into the co-poilets seat.
The engines roared and it started moving. 40, 50, 60, building up to the climax. I felt us leave the ground we were airborn. There was a magnificend veiw as we climbed up to thirty thosand feet. Then we went throgh a block of clouds. As we got higher the colder it became.
I then droped down to six thosand feet I could see the coast the see looked so cool that I wished that I would have a swim insead of being in that stuffy old cotpit. we droped lower and lower until there was a terific crarsh a seagul had been going over to the north coast and it had crashed into the front screen and smashed the glass. We then came in for the landing evrething cherged it was a good landding but when we got out comader [surname] told me to go into the study and look at the bird* charts. I thought to myself bang goes my dip in the sea.  Words: 214
