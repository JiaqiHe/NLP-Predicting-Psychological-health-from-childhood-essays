"""[name]!"" Oh hi my names [name[, I'm telling you about my home life, where I work and everything else just in normal, including my husband [name].
      ""Where have you been I've been shouting for ages, you must take an awful long time dressing, anyhow breakfast is ready, eggs and bacon at the double, after that off to work [name]"". Yes love, m-m, just let me drink my coffee than I'll be out of the bungalo double quick"", with those words [name] rushed out to work. He works from 9-o'clock till 6'o'clock in film acting. I washed up all the breakfast things and began to do the housework. I work part time in a factory, in afternoons. ""I better go and do some shopping"" I decided, ""otherwise that darling husband of mine will not have any dinner"". After I came back from shopping I put the dinner in the oven and put my feet up. For dinner we were having chicken, peas, roast Potato and of course gravy. ""I'm back dear"", called [name]. ""You'r home late [name] it nearly half past one, nevermind* I'll dish up dinner,"" well I dished up dinner and [name] went back to work and I went to work. Nothing much cropped up at the factory, it is'nt hard work making dresses if you no how to do it. That is really all that happens in an ordinary day for me and [name] so I'll end my describing as I'm sure its not to good."  Words: 248
