I Live at home still. I have got a job as a secretary on a farm. the farm is big enough to have me working full time. Also on the farm they have got lots of horses and I help ride them. Riding the horses is one of my jobs as a secretary. At home I usually go out every night. I go to clubs, dances and a di****** in (town). I buy most of my clothes in (town) as that is the nearest town for clothes. My life is a very happy one. My mian hobby is Horses and Riding. At home I help my mother with gettiing tea, and the nights I do not go out I sit and watch television. At work I am kept on the go all the while. I can drive and I have a car, a mini, a white one.
