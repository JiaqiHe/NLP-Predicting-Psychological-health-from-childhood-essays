When I am 25 I would like to be married and have three children 2 girls and one boy, I think that is because I am a girl. When I am older my ocupation would be hairdressing or I would like to be a pop star, but really there are snags in both things. I would like to have some sort of pet either a cat or a dog. When my children went to school I would not go to work because I think that It is wrong to go out and let your children come home to an empty house. I think that I would like to help in some sort of brownie or Guide work.  Words: 117
