My father is not very pleased in the way I is helping my uncle and grandfather run their buisnesses, he sais since I joined they didn't get much property, My grandfather runs an estate agency and so doese my uncle, but they work together. I do some of the unusual jobs. In the evening I play records, and record telivision programs on my video tape-recorder. Then I look at a book wich gives instructions for making a computor, at the moment I'm moking the shell and putting the dials and buttons on it. In the mornings I go to the office. Here is my time table. 9 o'clock Get up. 9.45 leave for work. 10.5 arrive. 12.30 lunch-break. 2 o'clock go back. 6.15 leave for home. When I finish the computor I will use it at the office, but we have an old one. in the afternoon I sometimes have to look over buildings which we might buy to decide if we will make a profit out of it.
