flowers would be beside my bed in a small house.
I am marrid and I have twins a boy and a girl they are one week old I have a job at a shoe shop on Fridays Saturdays and Mondays and I work at a fish and chip shop the other days. My husband is called [male name] and we go out a lot. My hobbys are singing and dancing and I go to a club on Sundays, sometimes I miss working at either job because I do shows. I am busy realy, and I am always buying new clothes for the family. My husband is a fantastick Acter and nobody could do better he is a comedian and is usualy apearing on the funniest film ever. The british film comidey.
I have stacks of baby things for the twins only. I have knowhere to put everything in seven days I will be at spain with [male name]. Auntie [female name] is looking after the children, hope it will be fun at spain when I get there I will watch the dancers. My husband like bull fighting and I hate it so he will go to sea a bull fight while I am at a dance. My husband is 25 aswell and he is 26 tomorrow I have bought him a new car [male name] will adore it. I HOPE. I went to bed at 11 o'clock so I could get evrything ready when I work up (I wouldn't be li**d) Across the road from our house is a spinney we go for walkes in there with my Husband, [male name].
