So yesterday I went to the shops and got the matirals I needed and to day I am hard at work, my wife wanted some polcitrane tile and Iam now putting them up. Last week I got a new car it is a Vaxuall viera* and is dark red. I am going to see if I can get some fish this afternoon because I have a liking for fishing espally* sea fishing. I also have some modell boats I have just finesed put the radio* control in one. I have got a 3 1/2 CC engine in it the boat is 2ft long and 3 ins wide it is a modell of a cruser. My father used to do a lot of modell boating he gave nearly all his equpment to me but I made the boar I was going to put an electric engine in it but then I decided to put a disal* engine In it.
