My work, interests and home life. 
     I am twenty-five years old and have just been to university. I have studied to be a doctor and now have a degree. Two* months ago I left university and started a practise in Sheffield. It would be good if in a few years time I could have five hundred thousand patients on my list. 
     In my spare time I like collecting stamps, collecting coins, playing the violin and looking at reference books. I have nearly collected three thousand stamps, and have a lot of foreign and old english coins. Also I can play the violin, and I also hope that I have a very knowledgeable mind through looking at these reference books. 
     I have just been married and my wife has just qualified as a nurse. She is as keen and ambitious as I am. My wife is having a baby in five months time. As we are both religious we attend church every morning. I am church warden in the church. 
     I hope many more marvellous things will happen as I get older, and that I live a long time.  Words: 192
