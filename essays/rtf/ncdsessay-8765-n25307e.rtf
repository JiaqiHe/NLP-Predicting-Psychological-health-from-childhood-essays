At five years old if someone would have asked me what I would like to be when I grew up my imagination would leap straight to being a space-man or a piolot maching-gunning germans and blowing them to pieces in mid-air. Now I am working in a laboratory making or inventing new drugs and medical equpment. I have been in this job for 1 1/2 years the pay is good and the working hours just right. I am single but starting to seriously think of getting married. I lead a happy home life I have just bought a new house for myself and have stopped living with my parents. I have a few interests and passtimes. I like reading and making models or listening to records and watching television. Sometimes I do paperwork for my job at home. you could call it advanced homework and I go to the cinema about one a fortnight and I like swimming.  Words: 158
