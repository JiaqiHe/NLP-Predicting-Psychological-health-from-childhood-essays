I am helping my brother in  our market garden. Some visitors come along to see some of the flowers. Their chilldren ask them for 1/6d to ride on our steam railway round the garden. They pay the money, clamber into the coaches and we're off. As I pass the vegetable garden I blow the whistle two gardners straighten their backs and wave and the children wave back. Now we're entering the tunnel and some children are screaming. Sudenly we're out again and on to the viaduct over the lake. Here, on an island there is a little station so that everyone can stretch their legs. After 5 minutes we're off again, through a marsh. The yells and laughter coming from the train frighten two flamingo's nesting there and they fly off. Soon we are back at the beggining again. and my brother passes me with another train. Our complete rolling stock comprises of 5 engines, 12 coaches three fruit vans, 6 open wagons, and one guards van. The garden started at a three acres and now is a flourishing concern of 26 acres taking up all my time.  Words: 188
