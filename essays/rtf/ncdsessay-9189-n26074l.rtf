Yesterday I was 25 so I though I would try and find a job. There was a job in the paper so I went to see it . When I got there I went st*** to the head man . The man asked me what kind of life are you going to lead. I said I am going to lead a happy life . He asked me what interests were . My interests are looking after animal playing net-ball Helping my mother and father at home It is a very happy world for me and I will see that I don't get in any truble . And I don't get mixet up in any ****** game . The work I am going to do is working ** a place where they keep animals . I like working with animals because you get to now more ******* . At home I like to see that everthing is neat and tidy. Maby I would get tired of working with animals . Then I would get a job as an air hoste** .
