"At home my parents are nice to me, which I live with. But I am thinking to get married, but my parents don't agree with me, but the girls family does, so I think they are going to try and persuade my parents. My Job is a good one, I work with an oil company I look for oil in the sea. When we have found oil we build a drill there, Which brings oil up from the sea. I am getting well paid for it aswell. My intrests are in animals, I keep some pets of my own, and breed Dogs. Some of my dogs as won competions, Dog Shows, and some more things. I live in a village called [village] about three miles away from [town]. A mate of mine always as breeded dogs and sometimes we sell them to some of the Villagers. The other pets I have are Ralbaits, Cats, and hamsters. I get on very well with my animals for I have taught them tricks. The hamster can pull a little toy barrow, my Rabbait can open the cage door by himself, ""and the cat"", Well I have taught him to when he wants to come indoors bang on the door with his long thin tail.  
Iam leading a good life with my Job etc. and I help my mum with the cooking sometimes, and. I like my weekends going out on saturday night and watch football on Sunday afternoon. In the morning* I play for our team ""The Oils Works Rangers"" and I enjoy it."  Words: 261
