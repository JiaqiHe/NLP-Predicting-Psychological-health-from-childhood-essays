I am now 25 years old and I wish to be married and have children of my own. And have a nice house and be happy I wished to have lots of freinds And not just a few of them And I want to be kind to my friends And make new friends.
      I am interested in knitting and sowing. I like nitting because I could nit a jumper. And I like going to pictures. And liked to lead a good life with my future family.
      I will go to church every holy day and on a Sunday. I will live in a nice houses. I will keep it clean and tidy. I wish to live in a house frist But after a few years I would like to live in a flat with three bedroom's and a bathroom and a tiolet kitchen and sitting.
I will get a good job for instants a Nurse or a teacher or a Telephonist. If I be a Nurse I will help people and make them better. And if I be a teacher I will teach children and make them clever. And if I be a telephonist I will put the people through If they want long distance.  Words: 204
