I am now twenty five years of age, and I go to work. My Interests are skating and dancing. I help at home by doing housework things. I work at a part time job in an office, and we have a break in the morning later on when it is about 11 oclock I help my mother do the house-work at home when I am not at work, in the afternoon. Every day in the week I go to work all except Saturday and Sunday that is. Every Saturday I go dancing and sometimes I go skating on a Sunday. I enjoy my work in the week  Words: 107
