Every day I would go to work. I work in a big shop in London. I have a car. At the end of every day I would drive home. At the end of every week I would get my pay. When I get home I put the car in the garage and go indoors. I would take off my coat and hat. I would take out my paypacket and give my wife her house coeping* money. every saturday I would go into the garden and week it. In the morning I get up at seven oclock. after breckfast I would go into the garage to see if my car was fit to go to work in if it was not I would go by bus  Words: 125
