My name is [male name] [surname], I am 25 and an ambitous sciectest. I had wanted to be one ever since I was in my first year in my secondary school. Now my dream has come true. I have just developed a formula that, when sprayed on crops it will reproduce them. I hope. although I have not tried it out yet.
I called my assistent Miss [surname] to ask he where to try it out. (I was new to the district). She said to try at Mr [surname]'s Farm.
Then minutes later we were driving towards his farm and I was praying that it would work. He gave us permission after a little persuation by Miss [surname] (she knew him). After arriving at a field of barley I turned round to ask Miss [surname] for the box which contained the formula. but she was not there. Where is that woman? I thought. Just at that moment I heard a car start up. I dashed to the gate just in time to see a big, black car drive away. Then the awful truth dawned upon me. A group of rogues had kiddnapped Miss [surname] and taken my formula!
Twenty minutes later I was at the police station telling the sergeant the number of the car -, [registration number]. He dissapeared for a breif moment and then reappeared the owner lives in a small village, Brookfield village it is called, a house called Brook house. One hour later the rogues were being escorted to the police station. My formula was safe!  Words: 257
