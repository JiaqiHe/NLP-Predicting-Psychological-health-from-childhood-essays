I am married and live in a small house in a quiet part of the town. I have a full time job as a vet and have pets of my own. Every morning I drive to work in my car which is a mini. My husband is a doctor and works almost the same hours as I do. Most of my spare time is taken up doing house-work but at night I like to watch television or read . My pets are a pyranee mountain dog a siamiise cat and a parrot. I live quite near my mothers house and see her every day after work. My husband takes the dog a walk every night and studys a lot. he also likes golf bud dosn't have much time to play it. We usually go down to the south of England for a holiday and a friend keeps our animals. Both our ambitionsare to become better at our work.  Words: 158
