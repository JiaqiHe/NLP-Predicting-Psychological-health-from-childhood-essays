If I was 25 I would try and get a job in the country, on a farm, pharaps. I dislike city life. If would not need much money as I don't intend to marry. I am very intrested in birds and bird life. I will join the R.S.P.B, and help to protect birds from becoming scarce. I hope to buy a small house, with a big enough garden to build some averies. I might be a keeper at a zoo, for I love animals. I also like fishing, and being alone a shall go fishing on weekends. I will not marry because I detest fussy wifes, and it will mean more mouths to deed and less pets and fishing tackle. I doubt if everything will be spik* and span*, for I am rather an untidy person.  Words: 136
