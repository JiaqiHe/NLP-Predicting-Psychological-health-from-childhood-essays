I share a flat with a girl-friend, my job is a riding instructress . I do this part-time, only on Saturdays. My other job is serving in a shop. It opens at nine in the morning and closes at six at night. On Saturdays I go to the riding school at severn to get the horses groomed, fed and saddled up. My first lesson is at ten , my last in the morning at twelve . I stay there for dinner then it opens after lunch at two till seven. at nights my friend and I suaully go out to the cinema or just to a cafe . Then we come home about ten, have supper and go to bed . We are up in the morning at seven as my friend and I have work . On Wednesdays afternoons it is half day so I go the riding school. Sundays are rest days except for going to church we just sit and watch television . My day off is Monday . In there morning I go to the hairdressers . after lunch I go to my cousens for tea and then come home. My main hobbies are riding , dancing, skating and reading . In the summer I can't go skating because the rink is closed . at the shop we get our holidays for summer in July . I am going to (place) for two weeks then coming home for the last week of the holiday . I like my life and hope to live it for a long time yet.  Words: 263
