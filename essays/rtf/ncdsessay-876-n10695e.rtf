I teach children of 7-8 years of age at a nearby primary school . I have no children of my own yet but I would like to have one. In my spare time I go out in the country. I love animals and also enjoying writing. At the moment I am trying to write a book about animals , A lot of my time is spent in doing school work. I have been at college and I am now a qualified teacher. I am married and I am very happy at home and with my job. I have lots of friends and when I can find the time I do a lot of visiting. I live just out of the town . I have passed qiute a few piano exams and I find this very useful as a teacher.  Words: 139
