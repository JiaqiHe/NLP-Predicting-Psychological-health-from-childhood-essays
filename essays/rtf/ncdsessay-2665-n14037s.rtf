MY LIFE I AM LEADING IS TO WORK AND PLAY FOOTBALL FOR TEAMS. AND SOME TIMES I LIKE TO PLAY CRICKIT IN PARKS AND FIELDS. MY WORK IS BEING A POLOICE MAN AND I HELP PEOPOLE ACROSS THE ROAD. AND OUR HQ AE ARE JUST ACROSS THE ROAD FROM MY HOUSE. AND IF WE SEE A* CAR PARKED ON A YELLOW LINE WE GIVE THE* A TICKET. ONCE I WAS A BANK CLARK AND WHEN I WAS SORING THE MONEY OUT MEN ROBBED THE BANK THEY STOLE 5,0000 POUNDS, AFTER THEY ROBBED IT I CALLED THE POLICE AND THEY GOT THE MONEY BACK FOR US THEN THE BOSS WAS GLAD TO GET THE 5,0000 BACK THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER BANK ROBBERY THIS TIME IT WAS THE BANK IN (place) IT WAS CALLED THE (bank). THE BOSS CALLED THE POLICE AGIAN. THIS TIME THEY GOT AWAY WITH 10,0000. BUT THEY GOT THE 10,0000 BACK AND THEY WERE PLEASE TO GET IT BACK.  Words: 161
