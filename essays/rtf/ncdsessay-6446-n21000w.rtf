I am training at Cambridge University to be a doctor, I am training full time and at home most of my time is taken up by studying books from a library and writing down what I have read.
Between terms I take up a small job. I have already passed my driving test and sometimes use my farthers car, althou I have a moto bike of my own, to go out on withe some of the other people who like myself are training to be doctors. I ride to and from the university on my motor bike. I sometimes go to see a match of cricket or football or some other game if it is some-where nearby.  Words: 116
