I am leading a good life I am not very poor and not very rich as well. I am interested in the legend of king aurther and the knights of the round table. My house is not very big it has two bedrooms upstairs and a bathroom downstairs it has two rooms a kittchen and a hall. I am married and I have two children both boys. I work as a designer for a big firm. I design engines and somtimes have to go a long way to design a new tupe of engine or a building. We go for our holidays mostly at [coastal town] or somtimes at [coatal town] or Scotland about once every four years we go abroad for a holiday or sometimes for buissness. My two son's are five year old and 2 year old.  Words: 139
