I would like to live in America because I have 3 aunts which live in Amer ica and thay say that it is lovely. I would not let my children get their own way because they would want their own way all the time . On Sundays if it was worm I would take my children to (shows) shows . If I was taking them any special place I would buy them a new dress or new trousers. I f they were going to church I would buy them a new coat. I would like to live in the to p flat because if you live in the bottom flat it is easy for any one to break in your house. I would teach my children how to cook. When they are ten years old because they will be able to cook when they grow up. I would like to be a waitress because I like serving dinners . It wouldn`t matter if you are not a waitress because you have to serve dinners to your own family. If I have a lot of children I would like a big house I would like a house with up stairs. I am going to keep my hair long because **** can put it in any style.  Words: 249
