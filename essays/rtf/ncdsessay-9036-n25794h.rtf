I hope to be married when I am 25, I would like to have four children but I may not have all of them by then. I would of just finished my training to be a doctor and hope to have started work as a General Practicioner in a medium sized village possibly **** and surrounding district. I would have a Land Rover with hard roofed rear compartment in which I would carry a stretcher and my medical instruments in case of emergency. If I got enough money I would get another car or Bedford type van for going on holiday. I would like a biggish detatched house with a thatch roof. I would send my children to school in ****or some other convenient place with a good school but not to far away. My mother and Father would visit me reguarly from St Albans* or wherever they lived then. I would like to mix with people. I would have a big front and back garden and I would tend and grow flowers fruit and vegetables myself. My wife would help me in the garden and as a nurse and I would help her with the housework.
