I am 25 years of age and am leading a life of being an Enganier Every day calls come in asking for their Television to be mended or phone wire ***** because the other ones split. I am Married and have a wife called (name) who has just had a baby girl (name) aged one month. My wife works in a college she is a secartary for a profesor and has many letters to write. My interests are fishing, Motor scambling and collecting coins. Nearly every saturday in the afternoon I spend my afternoon and my wife down at a club ******* and racing ******** cars. We sat the tad out exactly like **** hatch and the Le Mon like the one in France. Then in the evenings we watch the Television after the baby has gone to sleep. Sunday's we usually go to church for co*********.  Words: 147
