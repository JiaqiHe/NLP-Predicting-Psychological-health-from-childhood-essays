I work as a secretary. the hours are to 9 am to 5 p.m. When I come home from work I like reading books about crimes At night I go to a clubs, before I would go to the clubs I would go to a restaurant to have sometime to eat. the weekends I would go to shops and buy food and clothes for myself. On Sunday I would go and visted my mother. In the week I might go to the cineme, then I would come home and to put the television on Sometimes I get bored so I go swimming or I might go and play tennis with my friends. When I could'nt bother to go and play tennis I would go horse riding. On Saturdays my mother would come and see me, but she dose'nt very often.  Words: 140
