I am now 25 years old. It is the year 1983. I am married. I have got an electric dishwasher and a colour television. I am a ballet teacher and I dance on pointe. I have a horse called Blue Cloud who is a 15.2 h.h. dark grey with a white mane and tail. Clothes are plastic with sycedelic designs. I design my own clothes and sometimes design them for other people. I have a large house with 6 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms. It has a flat roof so that my helicopter can land on it. I do some amature acting and have performed in quite a few plays. Men are planning to live on Venus but the space Government say it will cost too much. People are also taking trips to the moon for holidays but I don't like the idea of carrying the oxygen cylinders around with me! Some eccentric man is thinking of rowing an open boat (the type they had in 1962) across the Pacific Ocean but I don't think he will reach his destination. I have also got a tele watch with a radio inside it. To make the meals I have a type of computor. You press a button with the meal you want written on it e.g. egg and chips then you hear alot of chugging and gurgling and then out of a shute at the bottom comes your complete meal of egg and chips on a disposable plate In the back garden I have a swimming pool with 4 diving boards and a spring board. Well I must go to bed now on my plastic air filled bed.  Words: 276
