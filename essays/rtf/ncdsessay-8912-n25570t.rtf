In the morning I get up at half past seven. Then I get ready for work. I am a secretary. I have a flat in London as I work in London. I have to be at work by nine o' clock. I earn twenty-six pounds a week. At one o'clock I have half an hour break for lunch. Then I go to a Cafe' a little way along the road and have lunch. I have a cup of tea, some fish and chips, and sometimes I have a desert. At five o'clock work finishes and I go home. When I have had my tea either I wright a bit of a book I am writing or my freind comes to take me out. Sometimes we go to the pictures. Usually we get back at about eleven o'clock. If I dont do this I carry on knitting some clothes for my brother's baby girl. I pay eigh pounds fifteen shillings each weekfor where I stay. At weekends I go either to my brother's house or to my parents to stay for the weekends.  Words: 182
