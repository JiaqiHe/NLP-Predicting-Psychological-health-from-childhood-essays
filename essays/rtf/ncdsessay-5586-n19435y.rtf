I am leading a normal life, but it is also a happy one. My child takes up most of the time. She is 4 months, and called Jo-anne. She makes a lot of work but it is nice. My intrests are, reading books and sewing or knitting things for Jo-anne. I would like to get out and do I bit of swimming or sailing, but Jo-anne is still a bit young. When she starts school I shall become a teacher because thats what i want to be. I like children and a like teaching them things. First I shall make sure that Jo-anne goes to a good school. I would like to teach 7-10 years old, gymnastics and history. At the moment I am reading a good history book. I like watching history programmes on television. They have just started. Every thursady evening, while my husband takes care of the baby I go to sewing class from 8-9 30. pm. During the lesson i make a lot of things for Jo-anne. I find my life happy and interesting and I hope it will continue that way  Words: 186
