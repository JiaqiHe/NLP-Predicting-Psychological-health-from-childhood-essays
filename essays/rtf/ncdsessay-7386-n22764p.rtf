"I am leading a good life with a child and the things that intrests me are flowers and looking after children. My home life is doing the house work and keeping the play room tidy. My work is sewing and knitting for poeple and makeing hats for the holidays. There would be lots of poeple lineing up waiting for some hats and there would be my father getting angry for his supper and sometimes I say ""why can't you make it yourself""."  Words: 82
