I am still living wiht my Mother and Father, and have not yet got married. I am interested in sewing X. useful things like gar ments for my mother, etc.
In the spare time at home, at the weekends and evenings, I help Mother by bakeing and doing the odd jobs about the house.
In the morning I start work at 10 o'clock and finnish at 4.30 p.m. I am a secutary for a school in (place). I enjoy my job very much because I like to watch children when they are happy.
My brother has a daughter called (name) and I often go and babysit for him while he and his wife go out.
One of my interests is to look after my pet, (name), a big labourder dog.
I hope to get married in a few years time, I think I am very lucky indeed to have all I want and I am very happy at the age of twenty-five.  Words: 157
