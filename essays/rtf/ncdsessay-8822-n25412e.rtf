I am a nurse and enjoy my work very much. It is in a very good cause. I work at [hospital] Salford. I am getting married in August to a boy called [name], he is twenty six. I go to Manchester United football matches. I like swimming and reading. I go away at the weekends if the weather is nice, I go with Peter, he has a white viva car. At the hospital it is very nice but the meals aren't very good. The other day a bus crashed into another car and twenty people were injured. Every Saturday afternoon I go to the baths for two hours, I see how far I can swim and how fast. I like stamp collecting and I have a big album with about six hundred stamps in. I like watching television. At home I make cakes and buns and I make the tea every night that I am off duty. Whenever I am off duty and it is raining I usually go to the pictures or stay at home and help my mum.  Words: 180
