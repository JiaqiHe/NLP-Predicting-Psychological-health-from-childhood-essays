----------------------
I am a married woman with one child at the age of 6 months. Every morning when I get up I tidy round the house. My husband gets up next, he rushes off to work very early as he has to get to his surgery at 8 am. At ten oclock I wake the baby up. I dress he in her best outfit as we are going into town. Before I had the child I worked as a nurse but I gave it up, and I am now a housewife. As soon as my child is old enough I shall teach her to swim, because when I was young I had a great interest in swimming. When I come back from shopping I shall have to make dinner because my husband comes home every dinner time. Every Wednesday I make his favourite meal, bangers and mash. Here he comes now, a briefcase under his arm and his tie slung over his back. After dinner he rushes off to work again. In the afternoon I have part time job as a dental assistant and I have to leave the baby in a nursery. I have only just started this job and I am very used to it. I dont pull any teeth out, I just quieten people down and help them off with their hats and coats, and get the dentals things ready. I come home at 4 pm, get the tea ready, and to me the day is over.  Words: 249
