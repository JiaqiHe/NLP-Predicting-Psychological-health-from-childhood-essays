My name is Mr. [male name] [male name] [surname].
I am in the Royal Navy I have served for seven years. When I get home I will get maried. I would like to live in Gernsey. I have been all over the globe with the navy to places like Majorca, Christmas Island, Easter Island, and South America.
My hobies are photography and swimming. (I hope to have a swimming medal.).
The navy has been good to me and I have learnt some Grades like radio oporating, life saving and deep sea diving. I had hoped to be picked to be one of the recovory crewe for getting the Appolo Astronauts.
When I get maried and have a family if we have a girl I would call her Sharon. I will have a rabbit a tortoise and a dog possibly a labradore or a Retriever.  Words: 140
