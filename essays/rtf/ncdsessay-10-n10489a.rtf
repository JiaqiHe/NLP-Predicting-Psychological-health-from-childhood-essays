I would by a car and take my wife out for a picnic or go to beach. My job would be a police man and I would catch all the robbers and I would stop any fights and fine people for going over the speed limit and parking on yellow lines. I would inspected any crashe's or fire's. On my day off I would take my children to the fair or out visting relatives. Then when I went back too work in my blue unform and it would be the same old week again. I stoped a protest march outside the town hall. They were throwing bottles and stones at the windows. Sometimes I would go to see my parents. When I see a grab and run I would run after the men or if they had a car get the numbers of the number plate. Soon they would be caught by the police car's. One day I was sent to see the segernt and I got sent down to London to stop another protest they were siting down there were hundreds of police men hitting with their trun-sions. One police man was badly injered he had a splite head. When it was over I went home my wife was waiting with my dinner. I thought that I was cut on the leg by one of the protesters. I bet they got fined.  Words: 233
