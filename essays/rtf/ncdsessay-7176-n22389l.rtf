I work in a bank in [city], which I enjoy alot. When I go to work in the morning I catch a bus which takes me right to the banks door. Then I go and stand behind the counter and sort out the money. Then I am ready to recieve my first customer. At nine o clock the bank opens and the customers start coming in. somebody gives me a cheque with a sum money on it. 
I get the money for the customer and take the cheque and stamp it. Then the customer goes away the another customer takes his cur her place. This goes on until eleven o clock, then the bank shuts. I go and have lunch in a restraute round the corner. I don't have to go back to the bank this afternoon, so I will do some shopping. After i have done my shopping I will go home when I reach my flat I will see what I have bought. Then I will have a little to eat. Then I will get a book out to read. After I have read about two chapters I will turn on the television. I like to watch programmes with ghosts in it or with a murder in it. About eight oclock if I am hungry I will go to the fish and chip shop and buy some plaice and chips. Then when I go get home I eat them. If theres nothing I like on the television I will go to bed early. When I can't go to sleep I usually think that I own alot of banks and I am very famous and rich. Then I am just going to name another ship when I fall a sleep. The suddenly the alarm goes off and its time to get ready to go to work.  Words: 307
