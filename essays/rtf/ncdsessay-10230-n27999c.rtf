I am know 25 years old and I work at a factory in London it is making tractors engines. I am very happy with my life. I work from 8 o'clock in the morning till half past six. And I sometimes go out on saturdays. And I go to some musems like in the wax works and other times I go and get my self drinks. And I still go to collage a few times a week so that I would learn some more things. I live in a house near London it is quite small if you compare them with other houses. I dont have much of a garden either. And I have a girl friend. And I am planing to get married but I do not have much money from the work I do. So I can not buy furniture or things like this. Because I have about 5xxxx a week of sometimes more if I do shift. So I will have to start saving my money up. But I was planing to get a car so that I could get to work better because if I catch a bus I have to pay fares geting there and coming back. The marrage is to be soon. And I have got her a ring which had cost me a lot fo the money. which I have saved up from work. I live on my own so I have to do a lot of work like washing up and washing the clothes. And cle**ing the house so it would be tidy. But I will do better when I get married and I can live a normal life for the rest of my life. I have a nother interest which is travelling around the country but when I am married I can go around the world if I wanted to. So this is my life.  Words: 314
