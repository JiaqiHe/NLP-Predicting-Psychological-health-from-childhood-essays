"It was just my 25th birthday. and I was on my way to the hospital, I was a staff nurse and work on the childrens ward. I started work at 9.00am and finish at 6.00pm, my interests at home were music and swimming though I did not have much time for any of these subjects, my mother had died and i lived with my father in a cottage in the country near to the country hospital, my father was frail and old and I was seriously thinking of getting married. I had two friends who were also nurses, Rachel, and Shirley, who I had met at the village school when I was younger, Shirley was a thin girl with ***er fair hair in a bun on the top of her, head she was pretty and had blue eyes she wore her white starched hat placed neatly on the top of her bun. Rachel was plump the opposite of n8* hirley, and had brown short hair and brown eyes, Rachel had just been married to a Doctor who worked on the same work as her, the womens ward. Since I had been young I had always wanted to be a nurse but though I found it very enjoyable it was also very tiring because I was on my feet all day, the sister of the ward had said I was to moved to the mens ward after the Christmas holidays because I was too attached to the children. The christmas holidays passed by very quickly and my father died, I was very upset*, and on top of that I was being moved to the mens ward, every thing seemed to go wrong. I didn't get on very well with the sister, her name was sister, ****, and was very strict she would come upto me and say ""nurse **** your hat isn't on probably a nurse **** when will you learn not to run down the corridors, even if it is in an emergancy."" After the Easter Holidays Sister **** ***as moved to a different word, and I enjoyed my ***ursing days immensly, after that how exiting it was to ***e a nurse!"  Words: 362
