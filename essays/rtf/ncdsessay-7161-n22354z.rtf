"I am leading an active life. I go to a stable every day I sometimes groom the horses but mostly I teach small children to ride. On Saturdays I take some friends on a back for the day. On Sundays I stay at home and do any work about the house. I would like to live in Devon and have a small cottage by the sea. Someday I would like to open a small equitation riding centre. If not I would like to have an Arab stallion. I would also like to keep some pet animals and tropical fish. I go out with friends somtimes to the cinema or buy dresses. I like entering gymkhanas* and horse shows. I get two margazines every week one is called ""Pony"" the other is called Horse and hound. I like collecting china ornaments and horse pictures."
