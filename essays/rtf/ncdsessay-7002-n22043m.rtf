I would not have much time to do the house work because I want to be a teacher. I will most probably be married and have one or two children I will certainly adopt children if I have any because I dont think its very nice for children not having any parents. I will adopt children about eight or nine so that thy will at school while I am teaching In my spare time I would go skating and try and become a profetional skater. In the evenings I would watch television. I would go shopping every saturday morning and buy all I would need for the res* of the week. This would save me going shopping nearly every day after school, it would also save me going into the town everyday because I want to live out in the country.  Words: 141
