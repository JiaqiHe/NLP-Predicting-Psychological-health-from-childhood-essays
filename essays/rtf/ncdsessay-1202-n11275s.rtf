I am twenty five and I am a teacher I get home from school at ten past four nearly every night. When I get of the bus I do my shopping then go home to my flat to make the tea. The flat I live in has two bedrooms one small and one large, a bathroom kitchen and living room. My pet is a dog called Spots, he is called Spots because he is a dalmation pup. At five o'clock every night I have my tea, watch telly for a bit and at six o'clock I take Spots for a walk, sometimes I take him to the park. When I get home at 7 o' clock I watch the telly till half past nine then I make some coffee and go to bed. In the morning I get up and make the breakfast a 8-15 I set of to go to the school I work at. At 12 o clock I come home for my dinner and set of again at 1-15. I leave the school usally at 4 o clock sometimes I stay until half past 4.  Words: 188
