"I am standing on the steps of a jet airliner, greeting the passengers with a smile and saying I hope you like the trip, Africa is very pretty in spring. ""The job I do is not very easy, running up and down to see to nauty children. As you might have guessed I am an air hosstess. I enjoy my work tremendursly and have seen a great many things. The effall tower, pyrimids, the leaning tower of Pisa and the water roads of Venice. Reading and needlework are great hobbies of mine, I also enjoy watching telivision and dancing. My mother and father are very fond of their one year old grand-daughter Helen and spoil her a lot. I play the piano and I often have to play a lullaby, for my husband to sing to, to get Helen asleep. Myself and my husband are very fond of animals and we have a pet mongrol dog called Lassie and a ginger car called ginger, Helen loves to romp with Lassie, he is very gentle with her."  Words: 176
