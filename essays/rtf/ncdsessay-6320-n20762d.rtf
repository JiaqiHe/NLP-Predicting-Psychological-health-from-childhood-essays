Then I take [female name] to the swimming baths, She can swim one length of the pool and I am teaching her how to dive. After we come home we hang our wet costumes up and then dry our hair. Every night I go into my room and do some typing with my new type writter and after that I watch telivision for a few hours. Once the programe of Canada was finished I made some coffee and I asked if we could imegrate to Canada. My dad said he would think it over, so all that night was peaceful. In the morning I got up my mum had a smile on her face and said ""We are leaving in 6 days time. We have a house in the South of Canada. The morning came when we had to leave our house. [female name] wanted to know where we were going and we explained that we were going on an aeroplane and that she would be able to see [female name] her bigest sister. when we got there I had to stop my work because of that but it did not bother me.
