"It was a clammy, close and very dirty sort of day. I was just going to my surgery, I am a vetinary surgeon. The lights were on and as I walked into the office there was horrible howl and I turned round to see a mangy mongrel dog lying on some'one's lap. ""Hello"" I said ""is there anything I can do to help?"", ""yes"", the person answered... and so began my day. When I got to my lodgeing's began my day. When I got to my lodging's there was a note on the table from my landlord saying he had gone out I picked up a book called ""pets and thier care' and started reading. After I had, had my dinner I took a way to work which I had never taken before, and I wa disgusted at the state of things dirty dog's and alley cats, were slouching around amongst the rubbish. 
     The afternoon was very much like the morning (from the point of view of work) and when I got to bed I was exhausted. And so ends my day."  Words: 183
