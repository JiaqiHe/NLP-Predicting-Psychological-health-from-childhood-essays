I am working in the Royal Air Force and I live on an [estate]. I have got a fairly big house. I have got a wife and two children. My garden is very big and I spend most of my spare time gardening. I go gliding once a week with my co pilot. I like boxing and cricket and I often go swimming and soon I hope to swim the channel. When I am older I hope to own a small private aircraft. I am not always at home because sometimes* I am sent to West Germany for about a week. I like Germany very much and soon I hope to go and live there The people are very friendly and there are a lot of mountains there. I like mountain climbing very much but I never seem to have enough time to do it. I also like skiing and there is quite a lot of snow there. I am living at [R.A.F. station] which is just at the bottom of [county]. I am the pilot of a Phantom fighter which is one of the best fighting aircraft in the world. I soneetimes do speeds of one thousand six hundred miles an hour. My pay is five thousand pounds a year. I went to university and then I joined a college of flying. I got married when I was twenty one. My house cost around eight thousand five hundred pounds. When I am thirty five I will give up flying in the R.A F and go in for civil flying.  Words: 260
