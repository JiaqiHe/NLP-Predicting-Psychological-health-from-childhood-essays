----------------------
I am now twenty five years old and I live in a terrace house, which has a garage beside it in which is my Morris Oxford estate which is blue. I am just going paint my garage white. because it badly needs a coat of paint. I live with my brother Tom who is a poilceman. I am also one.
We both get up at about half past five every morning which gives me just about enough time to get ready and go to work in my car. When my brother and I get a day off we go to the coast and climb some cliffs.
Most Saturdays I get posted at football matches in which I get famous autographs which I get at half-time. Once I had to stop a fight in which my face got cut with a knife, when I went to court the next morning the young thug you done this got sent to Borstal for two years. When I get my holidays I always go to [bay] at the [island] where there is a beau tiful spot where I go and climb the cliffs. I get the ferry at [city] to [town] where I have got my little yacht which I sail around to [bay].  Words: 208
