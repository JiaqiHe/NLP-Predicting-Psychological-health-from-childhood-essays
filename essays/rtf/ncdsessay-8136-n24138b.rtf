I am now 25 years old and I am working in a hospital. I go swimming I read books and knit We get home at weekends. I help at home. and help any one that is in need of help. I n the hospital you have to take care of the young babies. 
you have to change them. And feed them. Make beds and all sorts of things. Sometimes you are on night duty asometimes on day duty . This is all very well but you have to sit **** and all things like that  Words: 95
