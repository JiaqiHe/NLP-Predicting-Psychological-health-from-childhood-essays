I am now twenty five. I go to universety in Oxford. My Subject is litrieture. I work alot at home I write many Essase. I have about Six weeks Easter and christmas holidays. I write about dragons, Giants, and witches, in other words fairy stories fore children. I take lots of tests at universety. I have to change long words into Short words, fore small children to understand them. I have not much time to write letters to my parents, because I am always to busy with my work. The colage dinner is not very expensive. There are lots of dances and paulions. I will start writing grown up book as well. It takes me about three or four days to work out my book. I might get married. I am not Sure, I have one or two boy freinds. I have one pet witch is a mouse it is not very expensive either. In about a year I am leaving to get another job my parents Sometimes come and see me. Time speeds past, and before I know w here I am I am leaving universety. My job is now writing some books, but I soon give it up, to get married. I found a boy at a dance at the pavilion. He offerd me to have a dance. He is very handsom. It isent very often when you meet a boy thats handsom and polite, and nice. He asked me after about two months for a hand in marrage. I gladly exsepted. The wedding day was to be in May.
