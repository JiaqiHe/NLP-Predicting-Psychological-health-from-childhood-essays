On Friday evenings I go to the girl guide asociation. I am the leutenent, for the girl guides. Some days my work is hard and some days it is easy. I have to do the shopping about three times a week.

Sometimes my little girl makes me mad as she keeps crying for her bottle. I do quite a bit of cooking and baking as I like cookery. In my spare time I read books and watch television. I like nature. I also like collecting foriegn dolls and flower arrangements. My husband likes fishing and likes making aeroplane models. I am very fond of art.  Words: 172
