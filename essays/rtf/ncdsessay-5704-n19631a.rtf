When I am 25 I would like to be an air-hostes. Thuis is because I like flying, I like traveling. When you fly you do not even relise that you are flying.
I would like to work in a dogs kennel, where you look after peoples dog when they are on hoilday as I like animals I would like to be a dee-jay and here youself on the radio. I would also like to work as a school techer as I think that children at the age of 11 are usly quite plesant.
If I am mairred I would like to live in a bunglow. I would like the wall which joins the kicten to the front room knocked down and a cabinet put there instead. The bed would have to be a double bed. At each side of the bed there would be a little cupbourd with a lamp shade on top. If I was not mairred I would either go and live in a flat with freinds or live at home. If I lived at home I would be when it was time for bedroom to be done I would cosse my own wallpaper and pay for it myself.  Words: 199
