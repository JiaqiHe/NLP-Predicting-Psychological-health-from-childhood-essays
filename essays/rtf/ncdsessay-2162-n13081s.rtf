I am now greive at (place), and I am also married, I have two sons and a daughter. I am always intrested in agriculture machinery to find out if they are worth buying. Eavery morning I feed the pigs. Being greive is not a bad job because theres a lot to do, and telling the youger members the right and wrong. My house is a good one, there are three bedrooms, a fairly big living room, a big kitchen and the bathroom. I like garden work but I dont have much time to look after it. I usually work at the weekend on the farm but I like my job. When I come home at night, after my tea I like peace and quiet when I watch television . At ****ing time or when we start work I talk to the tractormen about films that were on the night before.  Words: 150
