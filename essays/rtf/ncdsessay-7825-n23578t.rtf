I have 1 child of 6 months old. In the morning I am busy making the beds and doing the washing and the shopping after that is over it is time to get the dinner ready. On a Sunday I would not be doing the washing or shopping. I leave that till Monday. But I will be doing the cooking and dusting everyday. We would not have a cooked breakfast we would have a cereal. On a Saturday afternoon I do the gardening with my husband. And then we go indoors and have a sit down. My husband comes home at 7,o'clock. He is a Taylor. The baby's name is [female name]. My Mother lives in Enfield. We have a dog his name is Tinker. Of a Saturday nights my husband and I go out. to the pictures while one of my friends baby-sits for us.
