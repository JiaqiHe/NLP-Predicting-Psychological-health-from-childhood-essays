My interests are teaching children to play the piano. on some nights of the week. I lik to play the piano often and listen to music on the transistor radio. I am leading a happy life and I like it very much. I sometimes go out with friends as a treat and I enjoy those outings very much. Also my interests are reading books and magazines. I like also watching the television at night and some of the programmes are good. My home life is a happy one and I do not often feel miserable. it is only when I have nothing to do that I feel miserable which is not often because usually I find lots of things to do. I like to be outside when the sun is shining. I sometimes play the piano for concerts. I also like to play the violin but I like to play the piano most of all. I like to play gay and happy pieces but I also play sad pieces on the piano. Not far from where I live some new houses are being built and I have been inside them and they interest me very much.
