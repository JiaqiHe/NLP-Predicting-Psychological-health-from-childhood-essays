I would like to be like my sister in law who has twin girls. I would take them a walk every day when I go shopping in the town. When I would be unpacking my bags after I had been shopping and if it was a nice day I would leave them on the yard. When they started to cry about 1oclo'ck I would get there bottles ready. I would then fetch them in and while I was feeding one I would put one in a chair witch I had brought for them. Because one is smaller than the other you have to knitt one thing smaller than the other. When they got a bit older and begin to notice things I would proberly bye a pet for them to play with. I would enjoy making clothes for them and I would ask some people over for tea. When they were about 'one I would put out a blanket on the lawn and leave them out to play with each other and to play with there toys. Being two of them they could always play with each other and ardly ever be bored*. There is not many childen on the Estate and when they are about nine they will only be about five on the Estate. I would call them [name] and [name]. In the summer when it is light nights I would take them on walk with my husband. Oftain I would have a spot of trouple one would cry in the morning and a noughter in the afternoon. Some times if they are crying you will take them a walk and they will stop crying and go to sleep. They are getting a little worried at the clinick because [name] is jetting over weight.  Words: 296
