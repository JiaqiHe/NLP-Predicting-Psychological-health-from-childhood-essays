But if I had girls I would call them Jane and Debby. In the day time I would tack* my children to a little school. for the day and then when I had finished work I would go and get them, or I might tack them to my mother and she would look after them or tack them to my mother intor and she would took after them. At the weekend we would go to the sea side, we would have a caravan. And at night we would sleep in it then in the morning we would go on the beach then we * would go back to the carvan and wash and put clean clothes on and then we would go back and have dinner. Then on the monday we would pack up and we would come home. But when the children go to school we will go to the sea side just for the day and that would be the sunday. But in the sun summer I would like to go abroad for a week or two, go each year to a drifent country like spain one year and the chin.  Words: 232
