I am now eleven and this is the life I want to lead when I am twety-five. I would like to live in the coutrey. I would not like to get marid, but I would like to have a dog named Brushes. The job I want to have when I am twenty-five is to be pilote in the air force. I woud not want to be a w/o like my father. I want to be a cathlic still. I want to suport Arnal. I got xxxx30 a week. The plane I would like to be in is a Hawker-Harer. When I was not working I would relax in the sun on a deckchair. I would not like to be an auto*t, I do not want to smoke* etheir. I could do reading in my spare time. MY hobies would be trains and antickes. The news papers would be the Daiy Mall, The sunday mirror and the Daliy secth. I woud like to fly a long way in a Hamver Harer. I would go travling a lot and walking sometimers.  Words: 179
