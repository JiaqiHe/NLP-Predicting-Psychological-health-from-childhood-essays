We had been prapering to move house for several weeks now and today was the day when the removel lorry come to take away our furneture to the house we had bought it was nicely cituated half way up a hill with a mavolos land scape you could see I had asked for a few days off of my job which was accountance and I had been given them. Aabout ten oclock the lorry came to collect the furneture and take it to the other house a few minutes later then the lorry left we left as well. The danger for padestians was grater befor the hover car was invented than now because as soon as the hover car was in vented all the pavements ahd steel curbs about a yard high and ove the roads ther was pedestriaon beidges. Now there was hovver lorrys and hovver byclycles there was much more car parks and cars if they saw some one with a for wealed car they thought it old fashioned but hovver cars had just come into fachion. By now we had almost got to our new home and we had over taken the lorry.  Words: 196
