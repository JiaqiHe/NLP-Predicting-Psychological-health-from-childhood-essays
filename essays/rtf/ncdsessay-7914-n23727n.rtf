I have just got marrid to a man called [name], and have just had a baby girl. I called her [name], I leave her in the day with a woman called Mrs [name], who looks after her as I go out to work in a  hairdressers shop, my husband goes out to work also he is a pilot to an aeroplane. In my spare time I look after ponies as I own three of them, and the rest belong to other people I call them Smokey, Blackie and Sandy. I usually go riding out on hills and along the beach. Soon my daughter will be going to school so I will have to see the head mistress of* the school, she will be going to. Another of* my hobbies is painting which I do when it rains. 
Tonight I will be having a party as it is my birthday and I have layed a long table with candles. there are 10 people coming it is all my relitives coming and my husbands relations aswell. I am giving them chicken for dinner and strawberrys and cream for pudding.
      Sometimes we go swimming in our pool in the garden and I am teaching my daughter to swim.
At the moment I am thinkinig of* emigrating to Austrailia, but my husband does not agree, and wants to stay here in England.  Words: 227
