----------------------
I would write many letters to friends and try to find my old school friends also, I would make the Birthday and christmas presents and sometimes the cards that I send. I would sew my clothes and knit the cardigans. I think for my job I would be a shop owner parhaps a needlwork shop.
I would own many pets I might even breed some. I think I would have a small house and not move too much, but if I did I live in a compleatly different place not stay in the same area, I owuld not go abroad to live, but I mite go abroad for holidays sometimes. My garden would have to be a bit big if I bred dogs or cats or any other sort of animals.
I don't think I wouldn't stay at home much but I would be out and around alot. I think I would prefer a bungalo rather than a house, because I think they look more tidy and prity with bright flowers in the front garden I am not to sure about the back because the dogs whould mess up the back garden, diging holes and things like that and it would be dificult to keep them out of it. I would always try to save coopons of the back of boxes and tins  Words: 221
