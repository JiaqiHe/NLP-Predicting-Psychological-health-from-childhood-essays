If I was 25 I would be going to work, I would be a perfeshnel footballer I would train and train and soon become one of the best footballers in the world. I would not smok or drink, I would have a very bu*t*ill house and a buitifull car, I would have hobbys like collecting coins and stamps and other hobbys like them. I would go on holidays across the seas. I would have a boat lern to be a good swimer and would have ounely one child because I would not like a lote of children thay would get into mistchef and be naughty. I would have partys invite all my friends and visit them. I would save green and pink sheild stamps and get things compleatly free and would buy my child a bicicle if it was a boy and a doll if it was a girl  Words: 149
