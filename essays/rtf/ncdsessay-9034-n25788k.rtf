"To-day I leave my university for my job as a doctor. I am fully qualified and passed all exams. Ah! I see my parents waiting in the drive with my elder sister who is a barrister. ""well claudia, we recieved your letter last week about you passing all your exams and we are very pleased and pround of you. To celebrate we have a little surprise for you at home and we are going out to dinner this evening"". ""I don't know how to thank you"" U said to my parents. 
     As we were driving back from Oxford I noticed how beautiful the coutryside was and this was mother nature's gift for me for passing my exams.
     I had a lovely evening out and my surprise was my room being decorated and as I was going to bed I decided to go swimming the next day. 
     As I open my curtains I find that it is a glorious day and perfect for going swimming. When I returned I thought I would opend an evening out with my friend **** who had just qualified as a child nurse. I explained to her I was looking for a room for a practise and she told me of one. I went to see it and it was just right.
     A few months later I opened my practice and a had a few complicated disease's on my hands, but after a while I cured them and everybody liked me."  Words: 247
