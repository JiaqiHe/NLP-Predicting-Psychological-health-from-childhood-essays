I will not be 25 until 1983. As I do not know what I will be doing when I leave school I do not know what I will be doing in 1983I wouldnot mind being a lorry driver, the lorryies of 1983 will probably be very much bigger than the one's we have now. It would be a lorry that would carry sugger beet or brocolli and I would take it from here to Bristol. My Mum and Dad are Londoners and thay came to cornwall to live and I was Born in cornwall and I Do not want to move from here. When I am 25 I will not be married because a women will cost too much muny to keep. So I will be able to drive my lorry to Bristol and back without having to bother about worrying aney one at home.
