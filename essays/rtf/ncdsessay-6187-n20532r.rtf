I am studying to be a nurse. I go to college every day from 9 o'clock AM until half past six at night. After I finish my work I go home and study for about 4 hours. The nights I don't study is a Wednesday and a Saturday because on a Wednesday I go to ice skating and a Saturday I just clean the house for my mother and watch the telivision at night. Sunday is also my day off but I study all day on a Sunday and sometimes I go out riding on a horse called Black Boy he is a very intelligent horse and he never bucks or shies or throws you of unless you hit him very hard with your crop or dig your stirrups into him when your riding him. Once I was put into a hospital when I was young and thats what gave me the idea of being a nurse. I want to be childrens nurse most of all because I am very fond of children. About three weeks ago I was told to go to a hospital to visit all the children and look after them in one of the nurses place, I was there for three day and then the nurse came back I was very sad to leave because the children were so nice so I bought them a book each.
