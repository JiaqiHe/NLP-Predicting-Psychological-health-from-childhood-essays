I GO TO work every day. I WORK IN the AiRFORCE And do not see my Family every day, IN the AiR Force I play Football and go swimming I am a pilot I fly Aeroplanes. I play for a football team I have no children. I would like to be pilot because my uncle was a pilot of a bomber Although he got killed in 1960 It does not change my mind to be a pilot. I am not afraid of heights of speeds I would be intrested to go to America.  Words: 93
