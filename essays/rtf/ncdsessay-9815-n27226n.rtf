I am twenty five and live in [town]. I work in [city] as a Secetary in an office. I am married and have no children. In the morning my robot called fingers, does the work while I make my husband a pill brekfast. When it is time for work I get in my space car and go off to work, but before I did I pressed a button and a bed slid already made into a wall. Then it was time for work, I got in my space car and went. When I got there, there were lots of buttons. When I pressed one a lift came down with arobot operator . Up I went to the fifty sixth floor and went into the office, where there was another robot holding some books with the information that was needed for that day. 
At last the morning was over. I got in my space car and went back home I took one of the dinner pills, and soon it was time to go back to work.
When the afternoon had finished, I came back home in my space car. At last it was time for bed, and I pressed a button and went to bed.  Words: 203
