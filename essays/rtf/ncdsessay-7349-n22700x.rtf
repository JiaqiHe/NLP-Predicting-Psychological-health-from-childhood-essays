It is a very hard life earning a living and I have got a Job as an electricion. I'm not married and I am never going to get married I am going to look after my parents with the money that I earn. I will able to get also a job in the computer industry in 6 months time and I will have to use my head on that because a computer has many intricate places to it and you get more money doing computer work. I would learn to drive and get a car of my own and I would get new clothes for me and new furniture and new carpets and new beds and new clothes for my parents and buy them anything they want. In my spare time I'll take my parents places and make them happy and when they die they'll die happy and * I would give them a nice funeral.  Words: 156
