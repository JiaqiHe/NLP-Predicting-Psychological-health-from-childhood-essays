I think that I would have had two children, and thats really all that I would like.
I would have married a farmer if I could and my main job would be looking after children and helping with the farm.
It is know coming round to harvest time. I think that this is the busiest time in the year, usually the children [male name] and [female name] would have come back for the holidays, then we would all tramp down to the field with a picnic for the men who had been at work.
In my spare time I do like to help in a club like the thursday club (this is a club for old people, and in the holidays I go and help Mrs [surname] with the games like Bingo ect.)
My choice for a place to live would be in [village] a little village just off Oxford.
I would like to have married when I was 19 like my mother, then I would have had [male name] and [female name] as twins when I was twenty three.  Words: 175
