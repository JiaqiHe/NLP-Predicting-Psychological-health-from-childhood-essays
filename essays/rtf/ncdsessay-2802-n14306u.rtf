If I was twentyfive I would live in a smallest house then I might get a good job and if I met a man I would get married and probbly have children if we had a nuff money we might get a bigger house. In the house that we lived in we could get new things in and I would try and keep the house clean as I could when the children get oldder I would make their dinners still. If I did not get married I would help people and then go home and whatch television. When I'm not married I'll be young and if I have a job to pick myself I would pick a good one that I get a good pay of wages to help me pay a bill or some thing.  Words: 136
