I have got married with two children. We have a very big house with a lovely garden. I am very interested in horse-riding, swimming, and ice-skating. I work in an office and do short-hand, and in my spre time I go to the dispensary for sick animals and help. My life is mainly working, making meals, and looking after animals and children. My best hobbies are horse-rideing and ice-skating. One day I hope to be a champion at both of these things. We have alot of pretty flowers in our garden. We also have a chauffer, a house-maid, and a gardener. We have a very big car (Rolls Royas,) which the chauffer uses and one of our own which is a Jaguar. We live in America and my life is very happy.  Words: 132
